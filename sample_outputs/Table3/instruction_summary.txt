Below is a direct mapping from the constructs in your analysis summary to the concrete GSS data fields in the variable documentation, followed by how each construct should be built from those fields.

---

## 1. Core genre-attitude variables (Table 3)

Table‑3 “attitude toward 18 music genres” items are exactly the 18 GSS variables listed in the CSV. Each has the same response scale:

- 1 = like very much  
- 2 = like it  
- 3 = mixed feelings  
- 4 = dislike it  
- 5 = dislike very much  
- NA codes (d, m, n, etc.) = don’t know / no answer / not applicable, etc.

**Mapping of genres in the paper ⇔ GSS variables**

1. Big Band / Swing → `bigband`  
2. Bluegrass → `blugrass`  
3. Country/Western → `country`  
4. Blues/R&B → `blues`  
5. Broadway musicals / Show tunes → `musicals`  
6. Classical / Chamber → `classicl`  
7. Folk → `folk`  
8. Gospel → `gospel`  
9. Jazz → `jazz`  
10. Latin / Salsa / Mariachi → `latin`  
11. Mood / Easy listening / Pop/easy listening → `moodeasy`  
12. New Age / Space music → `newage`  
13. Opera → `opera`  
14. Rap → `rap`  
15. Reggae → `reggae`  
16. Contemporary pop/rock → `conrock`  
17. Oldies rock → `oldies`  
18. Heavy metal → `hvymetal`

These 18 variables are the sole source for:

- Table 3 frequency distributions (categories 1–5 plus non-substantive responses).  
- Table 3 mean ratings (treating 1–5 as numeric, excluding NA codes).  
- All downstream dislike/tolerance/familiarity measures in the models.

## 2. “Dislike” vs. “non-dislike” coding

Across all analyses that use dislikes:

- For each music variable listed above:  
  - **Dislike** (indicator = 1) if value ∈ {4, 5}.  
  - **Non-dislike** (indicator = 0) if value ∈ {1, 2, 3}.  
  - **Missing** if value is any NA code in the GSS metadata (e.g., `NA(d)`, `NA(m)`, `NA(n)`, etc.).

This unified recode is used for:

- Overall count of dislikes (0–18).  
- Count of dislikes in the “minority genres” subset (6 genres).  
- Count of dislikes in the remaining 12 genres.  
- Binary DVs (“dislikes this genre”) in the logistic regressions.

---

## 3. Overall musical exclusiveness: count of dislikes (Table 1 DV)

**Concept:** “Number of genres disliked” (0–18).

**Input variables:** the full set of 18:

`bigband blugrass country blues musicals classicl folk gospel jazz latin moodeasy newage opera rap reggae conrock oldies hvymetal`

**Construction:**

1. For each of the 18 variables, define a genre-specific dislike indicator:
   - `genre_dislike = 1` if genre variable ∈ {4, 5}.  
   - `genre_dislike = 0` if genre variable ∈ {1, 2, 3}.  
   - Missing otherwise.

2. **Sample restriction for this scale (as described in the paper):**  
   Drop respondents with any “don’t know much about it” / DK / NA on any genre. Operationally, this can be implemented as:

   - If any of the 18 variables is coded in any NA category (including `NA(d) don’t know`, `NA(m) dk, na, iap`, `NA(n) no answer`, etc.), then set the overall count to missing for that respondent.

3. Sum across the 18 dislike indicators for each respondent:

   - `overall_dislikes = Σ(genre_dislike for all 18 genres)`,  
   - range: 0 to 18.

This `overall_dislikes` variable is **exactly** the DV used in all three OLS models in Table 1.

---

## 4. Subscales by racial/ethnic association (Table 2 DVs)

The same 18 GSS music items are partitioned into:

### 4.1 “Minority-associated” genres (6-genre dislike count)

**Minority-associated genres (per the article’s definition):**

- Rap → `rap`  
- Reggae → `reggae`  
- Blues/R&B → `blues`  
- Jazz → `jazz`  
- Gospel → `gospel`  
- Latin/Salsa/Mariachi → `latin`

**Construction:**

- Use the same 1/0 “dislike” coding as above (4–5 = 1, 1–3 = 0, NA = missing) for each of these 6 variables.  
- Sum to create:

  - `dislikes_minority_genres = rap_dislike + reggae_dislike + blues_dislike + jazz_dislike + gospel_dislike + latin_dislike`,  
  - range: 0 to 6.

This `dislikes_minority_genres` is the DV for the **left panel** OLS model in Table 2.

### 4.2 “Other 12” genres (non-minority subscale)

**Remaining 12 genres:**

- `bigband`  
- `blugrass`  
- `country`  
- `musicals`  
- `classicl`  
- `folk`  
- `moodeasy`  
- `newage`  
- `opera`  
- `conrock`  
- `oldies`  
- `hvymetal`

**Construction:**

- Again, recode each to a dislike indicator (4–5 = 1, 1–3 = 0, NA = missing).  
- Sum across these 12 indicators:

  - `dislikes_other_genres = Σ(dislike of those 12 genres)`,  
  - range: 0 to 12.

This `dislikes_other_genres` is the DV for the **right panel** OLS model in Table 2.

---

## 5. Genre-specific binary DVs (logistic models / Figure 1)

For each of the 18 genres, a separate logistic regression uses a genre-specific binary DV:

**Generic construction for a focal genre variable `g` in:**

`{bigband, blugrass, country, blues, musicals, classicl, folk, gospel, jazz, latin, moodeasy, newage, opera, rap, reggae, conrock, oldies, hvymetal}`

1. **DV for that model:**

   - `dislike_g = 1` if `g ∈ {4, 5}`.  
   - `dislike_g = 0` if `g ∈ {1, 2, 3}`.  
   - Missing otherwise.

2. **Key IV: musical tolerance excluding the focal genre** (see next section).  
3. **Control:** education (from GSS education variable; not defined in CSV but standard GSS).

Each genre’s logistic regression uses:

- DV: `dislike_g`.  
- IVs include: “tolerance excluding g” and education.

---

## 6. Musical tolerance: count of genres not disliked

**Concept:** Number of genres not disliked, usually excluding the focal genre when that genre is the logistic DV.

**Base from the same 18 variables**:

- For each genre `g`, we already defined:

  - `dislike_g` as above.  
  - Then define `not_dislike_g = 1 – dislike_g` (so `not_dislike_g = 1` if rating ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 0 if ∈ {4, 5}; missing if original value is NA).

### 6.1 Overall tolerance (for concept/descriptives)

If needed conceptually:

- `overall_tolerance = Σ(not_dislike_g for all 18 genres)`, range 0–18.

### 6.2 Tolerance excluding a focal genre (used in logistic regressions)

For a logistic model where the DV is `dislike_g`:

- Construct `tolerance_excl_g` as the sum across the other 17 genres:

  - `tolerance_excl_g = Σ(not_dislike_h for all h ≠ g)`.

This `tolerance_excl_g` variable is the “musical tolerance” predictor plotted in Figure 1 (one such tolerance variable per logistic regression, each excluding its own focal genre).

---

## 7. Breadth of familiarity: count of “don’t know” responses (H6 DV)

**Concept:** Number of “don’t know much about it” responses across the 18 genres.

In the NORC distributions, “don’t know much about it” is implemented as one or more NA codes (the documentation collapses DK/NA/IAP under `NA(m)` and related categories).

**Operationalization with the provided metadata:**

- For each of the 18 music variables, define a DK/NA indicator:

  - `dk_g = 1` if value is any non-substantive NA code (e.g., `NA(d)`, `NA(m)`, `NA(n)`, etc.).  
  - `dk_g = 0` if value ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

- Sum across all 18:

  - `num_dk_genres = Σ(dk_g for all 18 genres)`,  
  - range: 0 to 18.

This `num_dk_genres` variable is used as:

- The DV in the education–familiarity correlation and mean comparisons for H6.  
- The basis for the sample restriction when building the main exclusiveness scale (respondents with `num_dk_genres > 0` are excluded from that scale, per the article).

---

## 8. Linking to independent variables (for completeness of mapping)

Although not in your CSV excerpt, the analysis summary refers to standard GSS constructs. When you build the models, the music-based DVs above are combined with these IVs (using the usual corresponding GSS variables):

- Education (years of schooling) → `educ` or equivalent.  
- Household income per capita → derived from household income (`realinc` or similar) divided by household size.  
- Occupational prestige → `prestg80` or appropriate prestige score.  
- Gender → `sex` (coded female = 1).  
- Age → `age`.  
- Race/ethnicity → `race`, `hispanic` (to make Black/Hispanic/Other dummies, White non-Hispanic as reference).  
- Religion/denomination → `relig`, `denom`, `other` to derive Protestant, conservative Protestant, no religion.  
- Region (South) → `region` or `srcbelt` (South dummy).  
- Political intolerance scale (0–15) → summed from 15 civil-liberties items.  
- Racism scale (0–5) → summed from 5 race-attitudes items.

These IVs are not derived from the music items; they only enter as predictors.

## 9. Compact summary of the mapping

- **Table 3 items** = 18 GSS music fields: `bigband` through `hvymetal`.  
- **Dislike coding** for all analyses: 4–5 = dislike; 1–3 = not dislike; NA codes = missing.  
- **Overall musical exclusiveness** = sum of dislikes across those 18 (0–18), dropping respondents with any DK/NA on any genre.  
- **Minority-genre dislikes** = sum of dislikes across `rap`, `reggae`, `blues`, `jazz`, `gospel`, `latin` (0–6).  
- **Other-genre dislikes** = sum of dislikes across the remaining 12 music variables (0–12).  
- **Genre-specific dislike DVs** = binary from each single music variable (4–5 vs. 1–3).  
- **Musical tolerance** = count of genres not disliked (1–3), either 0–18 overall or 0–17 when excluding the focal genre in logistic models.  
- **Breadth of familiarity** = count of NA/DK codes across the 18 music variables (0–18).

These mappings are sufficient to recreate the dependent variables and key derived constructs described in the analysis summary from the specific GSS 1993 music-module fields in your CSV.
