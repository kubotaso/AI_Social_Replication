## Data source

- **Survey:** 1993 General Social Survey (GSS), National Opinion Research Center.
- **Sample:** 1,606 non-institutionalized U.S. adults; N varies slightly by item because of missing data.
- **Music module:** Respondents rated **18 musical genres** on a 5-point Likert scale.

## Table 3 itself

**Title:**  
“Table 3. Frequency Distributions for Attitude toward 18 Music Genres: General Social Survey, 1993”

**Core variables in Table 3**

For each of 18 genres, Table 3 shows:

- **Dependent variable:** Attitude toward that musical genre.
- **Response categories (coding implicit but clear):**
  1. Like very much  
  2. Like it  
  3. Mixed feelings  
  4. Dislike it  
  5. Dislike very much  
  (M) Don’t know much about it  
  (M) No answer
- **Also:** The **mean** value (1–5 scale) for each genre.

**18 music genres listed (columns):**

1. Latin/Salsa  
2. Jazz  
3. Blues/R&B (Blues/Rhythm & Blues)  
4. Show tunes  
5. Oldies  
6. Classical/Chamber  
7. Reggae  
8. Swing/Big Band  
9. New Age/Space music  
10. Opera  
11. Bluegrass  
12. Folk  
13. Pop/Easy listening  
14. Contemporary rock  
15. Rap  
16. Heavy metal  
17. Country/Western  
18. Gospel  

Table 3 is **descriptive**, not a regression table. It provides distributions and mean attitudes by genre, which the author then interprets in light of the regression-based results.

## How Table 3 connects to the regression models

### 1. Construction of the main dependent variables

Using the 5-point ratings from Table 3, Bryson defines several derived variables used in regressions:

1. **Musical exclusiveness (overall dislikes)**
   - Source items: the 18 genre-attitude variables displayed in Table 3.
   - Coding:  
     - “Dislike it” (category 4) and “Dislike very much” (category 5) are counted as **dislikes**.  
     - “Like very much,” “Like it,” and “Mixed feelings” are not counted.  
     - “Don’t know much about it” is treated as missing for that genre; respondents with any DK on any genre are dropped (final N=912 mentioned for this scale).
   - **Scale:** Count of dislikes from 0 to 18.
   - Descriptives: mean = 5.78, SD = 3.76.

2. **Two subscales of dislikes by racial/ethnic association of audiences** (used in Table 2)
   - Based on cross-tabs (not shown) using GSS: identify genres disproportionately liked by Black or Hispanic respondents (p < .001).
   - **Minority-associated genres (6):**
     - Rap
     - Reggae
     - Blues/R&B
     - Jazz
     - Gospel
     - Latin/Salsa
   - **Subscale 1 (minority genres):** Count of dislikes (4 or 5) across these six.
   - **Subscale 2 (remaining 12 genres):** Count of dislikes across the other 12.

3. **Musical tolerance (used in the logistic regressions summarized in Figure 1)**
   - Defined as the **number of genres not disliked** (i.e., 18 – number of dislikes), typically excluding the focal genre when it is the dependent variable in a logistic model.

4. **Breadth of familiarity**
   - Number of “don’t know much about it” responses across the 18 genres (using the “M” category in Table 3).
   - Used descriptively to test whether DKs decline with education.

**Thus, every regression-based dependent variable is built from the 18 attitudinal items whose distributions are presented in Table 3.**

## Independent variables used in the models

These are not in Table 3, but they are the predictors used with the Table‑3-based outcomes.

### Socioeconomic status (SES)

- **Education:** Years of schooling (continuous).
- **Household income per capita:** Continuous (logged or scaled—paper says “per capita,” treated linearly).
- **Occupational prestige:** Standard GSS occupational prestige score (continuous).

### Demographic and identity controls

- **Gender:** Female (dummy).
- **Age:** Continuous.
- **Race/ethnicity:**
  - Black (dummy)
  - Hispanic (dummy)
  - Other race (dummy)
  - (Reference: non-Hispanic White)
- **Religion:**
  - Protestant (dummy)
  - No religion (dummy)
  - (Reference: other religions)
- **Region:** Southern (dummy).
- **Conservative Protestant:** Dummy (labeled “Conservative Protestant” in tables).

### Intergroup affect / ideology

1. **Political intolerance scale** (0–15; α=.9163)
   - Count of **intolerant** responses (refusal to extend civil liberties) across 15 items:
     - 5 target groups:
       1. Person “against churches and religion”
       2. Person who “believes that Blacks are genetically inferior”
       3. Person who “admits he is a Communist”
       4. Person who “advocates doing away with elections and letting the military run the country”
       5. Person who “admits he is a homosexual”
     - For each group: whether respondent would allow them to  
       a) make a speech in the community,  
       b) teach in a college or university,  
       c) have a book in the public library.
   - Each intolerant response = 1; sum across 15.

2. **Racism scale** (0–5; α=.54)
   - Five dichotomous items (coded in “racist” direction):
     1. Objection to children attending a >50% Black school.
     2. Opposition to busing Black and White children between districts.
     3. Denying discrimination as main cause of Blacks’ worse jobs/income/housing.
     4. Denying lack of educational opportunity as the cause.
     5. Affirming that Blacks’ situation is because they “don’t have the motivation or will power.”

## Regression models involving Table‑3-based variables

### A. OLS regressions on overall musical exclusiveness (Table 1)

**Dependent variable:**
- Number of genres disliked (0–18), built from Table-3 items.

**Model 1: SES Model**
- DV: number of genres disliked.
- IVs:
  - Education
  - Household income per capita
  - Occupational prestige
- Method: OLS; standardized coefficients.
- Purpose: Test High-Status Exclusiveness (H1) vs Educated Tolerance (H2).

**Model 2: Demographic Model**
- DV: number of genres disliked.
- IVs:
  - Education, household income per capita, occupational prestige
  - Female
  - Age
  - Black, Hispanic, Other race
  - Conservative Protestant
  - No religion
  - Southern
- Method: OLS; standardized coefficients.
- Purpose: Assess whether demographic identities explain the education–exclusiveness link.

**Model 3: Political Intolerance Model**
- DV: number of genres disliked.
- IVs:
  - Education, income per capita, occupational prestige
  - Female
  - Age
  - Black, Hispanic, Other race
  - Conservative Protestant
  - No religion
  - Southern
  - Political intolerance scale
- Method: OLS; standardized coefficients.
- Purpose: Test H3 (political intolerance → musical exclusiveness) and see if political intolerance mediates education/age effects.

### B. OLS regressions on dislikes separated by racialized genres (Table 2)

These models use the **two dislike subscales** derived from the Table-3 genres.

**Model 1 (left panel): Dislike of rap, reggae, blues/R&B, jazz, gospel, and Latin**

- DV: count of dislikes among the 6 minority-associated genres.
- IVs:
  - Racism score
  - Education
  - Household income per capita
  - Occupational prestige
  - Female
  - Age
  - Black, Hispanic, Other race
  - Conservative Protestant
  - No religion
  - Southern
- Method: OLS; standardized coefficients.
- Purpose: Test H4: high racism → more dislikes of genres disproportionately liked by people of color.

**Model 2 (right panel): Dislike of the 12 remaining genres**

- DV: count of dislikes among the remaining 12 genres.
- Same IVs as above.
- Purpose: establish that racism specifically predicts dislikes of minority-associated genres, not dislikes in general.

---

### C. Logistic regressions on disliking each individual genre (summarized in Figure 1)

These models use **binary DVs**, constructed from the Table‑3 attitudes.

For each of the 18 genres, Bryson estimates:

- **DV:** Dislikes genre (1 if category 4 or 5; 0 otherwise).
- **Key IV:** Musical tolerance (number of genres not disliked), **excluding** the focal genre.
- **Control:** Education (years).
- Method: Logistic regression.
- Output used: Coefficient of musical tolerance for each genre, then plotted in Figure 1.
- Purpose: Test H5 — whether people with generally tolerant musical tastes are systematically more likely to exclude low-status genres (those with least educated audiences).

---

### D. Descriptive correlation of education with “don’t know” responses (Hypothesis 6)

- **DV:** Number of “don’t know much about it” responses across the 18 genres (from Table 3).
- **IV:** Education.
- Method: Pearson correlation; also mean comparison.
- Findings:
  - Corr(education, # DK) = −0.15 (p < .01).
  - Mean education:  
    - At least one DK: 12.6 years  
    - No DK answers: 13.4 years (p < .0001).
- Purpose: Test H6 — whether breadth of familiarity (low DK count) increases with education, supporting the idea of “multicultural capital.”

## Summary specific to your request

- **Table 3** presents:
  - The raw **frequency distributions and means** of attitudes toward each of **18 genres** on a 1–5 scale plus DK/NA categories.
- Those 18 variables are used to construct:
  - **Count of dislikes across all genres** (main DV in Table 1).
  - **Count of dislikes of six minority-associated genres** and of the **other 12 genres** (DVs in Table 2).
  - **Binary dislike indicators** for each genre (DVs in the logistic models summarized in Figure 1).
  - **Count of “don’t know” responses** (familiarity measure for H6).
- **Statistical methods involving these variables:**
  - **OLS regression** with standardized coefficients (Tables 1 and 2).
  - **Logistic regression** (genre-by-genre models for Figure 1).
  - **Bivariate correlations** and mean comparisons for DK responses.

If you want, I can itemize the exact recodes (e.g., how 1–5 become dislike vs. non-dislike, or show a schematic of the three levels of outcomes: overall count, subscale counts, and binary per-genre).
