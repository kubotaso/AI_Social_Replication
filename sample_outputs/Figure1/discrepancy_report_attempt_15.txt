Discrepancy report

Exactly what differs from the ground-truth:
- Series assignment is swapped. In the ground-truth the jagged line is the “Coefficient for Musical Tolerance” (solid) and the smoother, upward‑trending line is “Mean Education of Genre Audience” (dash‑dot, on the right y‑axis). In the generated plot the solid line is the education series and the dash‑dot line is the coefficient series.
- The horizontal reference line (“Sample Mean Education”) is at the wrong level. It is drawn near −0.31 (left scale) instead of the right‑axis mean education (~13–13.3), which maps to about −0.36 on the left scale.
- Left y‑axis tick label formatting: ground‑truth shows ticks as −.5, −.4, …, −.1 (no leading zero). The generated plot shows −0.5, −0.4, …, −0.1.
- Annotations are anchored to the wrong series/positions (“Coefficient …” points to the solid line in the generated figure; it should point to the jagged solid line after fixing series; “Mean Education …” should point to the dash‑dot series; “Sample Mean Education” text should sit just below the dotted line).
- Minor style mismatches: no markers; solid line width slightly heavier in the original (~2); dash‑dot style should be used for education; only the horizontal dotted reference line (no grid).

Fix steps (data + matplotlib)

Data prep
- Ensure the genre order exactly matches:
  ['Latin/Salsa','Jazz','Blues/R&B','Show Tunes','Oldies','Classical','Reggae','Swing','New Age/Space','Opera','Bluegrass','Folk','Easy Listening','Pop/Rock','Rap','Heavy Metal','Country','Gospel']
- Keep two separate arrays aligned to that order:
  coef = [...]               # tolerance coefficients (negative values ~−0.45..−0.15)
  mean_edu = [...]           # audience mean education (~12..15)
- Compute the sample mean of education (not the coefficients):
  m_edu = np.mean(mean_edu)  # or a weighted mean if appropriate

Matplotlib calls (only the essentials)
- Create axes and plot the correct series on the correct axes:
  fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,6))
  x = np.arange(len(coef))
  # Left y-axis: coefficients (solid)
  ax.plot(x, coef, color='k', lw=2.0, linestyle='-')
  ax.set_ylim(-0.5, -0.1)
  ax.set_yticks(np.arange(-0.5, -0.09, 0.1))
  # Right y-axis: mean education (dash-dot)
  ax2 = ax.twinx()
  ax2.plot(x, mean_edu, color='k', lw=2.0, linestyle='-.')
  ax2.set_ylim(12, 15)
  ax2.set_yticks([12, 13, 14, 15])
- Draw the reference line at the sample mean of education on the right axis so it aligns with both scales:
  ax2.axhline(m_edu, color='k', linestyle=':', lw=1.2)
- Format left y-axis tick labels to match ground-truth (no leading zero):
  from matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter
  ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(FuncFormatter(lambda v, p: str(f'{v:.1f}').replace('-0.', '-.').replace('0.', '.')))
- X ticks:
  ax.set_xticks(x)
  ax.set_xticklabels(['Latin/Salsa','Jazz','Blues/R&B','Show Tunes','Oldies','Classical','Reggae','Swing','New Age/Space','Opera','Bluegrass','Folk','Easy Listening','Pop/Rock','Rap','Heavy Metal','Country','Gospel'], rotation=45, ha='right')
- Labels:
  ax.set_ylabel("Coefficients for Musical Tolerance as It Affects One's Probability of Disliking Each Music Genre")
  ax2.set_ylabel("Mean Educational Level of Respondents Who Reported Liking Each Music Genre")
  ax.set_xlabel("Type of Music")
- Annotations (attach to the correct axes):
  ax.annotate('Coefficient for Musical Tolerance', xy=(2, coef[2]), xytext=(0.6, -0.35), arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->'), ha='left', va='top')
  ax2.annotate('Mean Education of Genre Audience', xy=(9, mean_edu[9]), xytext=(4.5, 14.6), arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->'), ha='left')
  ax2.annotate('Sample Mean Education', xy=(8, m_edu), xytext=(7.5, m_edu-0.2), arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->'), ha='left', va='top')
- Style tweaks to match:
  for a in (ax, ax2):
      for s in a.spines.values(): s.set_linewidth(1.5)
  ax.grid(False)

Implementing the above will make the replication match the ground-truth figure exactly: correct series on the correct axes and linestyles, correctly placed reference line, matching tick formats, and corrected annotations.
