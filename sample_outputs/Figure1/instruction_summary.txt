Here are the dataset columns you need to reproduce Figure 1, mapped to the 18 genre labels plus education. I list the most common GSS variable names used for the 1993 Culture Module, and include robust alternates in case your extract uses slightly different names.

Core covariate

Practical verification tips (if names differ in your file)
- These 18 variables appear only in 1993 (year == 1993) and have identical response scales: 1 = like very much, 2 = like it, 3 = mixed feelings, 4 = dislike it, 5 = dislike very much, plus explicit “don’t know much about it” and “no answer” codes (commonly 8 and 9 in GSS; treat any value outside 1–5 as missing).
- If your extract uses different names, search variable labels for the exact genre strings (e.g., “Latin/Salsa”, “Show Tunes”, “Pop/Easy Listening”, “Contemporary Rock”, “Heavy Metal”, “Classical/Chamber”, “Swing/Big Band”, “New Age/Space”, “Blues/R&B”). The battery typically has a common stem like “How much do you like or dislike the following types of music”.
- Case and length can vary by extract; names may be uppercase in some releases (e.g., LATINSA, SHOWTUNE, HEAVYMTL).

With educ plus these 18 genre items, you can compute Y_g, TOL_g, run the 18 logistic regressions, and build the overlays (per-genre mean educ among likers and overall mean educ) exactly as specified.
