Figure 1: What to compute and how to plot it

Data source
- 1993 General Social Survey (GSS), Culture Module.
- Unit: U.S. noninstitutionalized adults.
- Music battery: 18 genres, each rated on a 5-point Likert scale: 1 = “like very much”, 2 = “like it”, 3 = “mixed feelings”, 4 = “dislike it”, 5 = “dislike very much”, plus “don’t know much about it” and “no answer”.

Genres (exact labels used)
- Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber; Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk; Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel.

Variables and recodes needed
- Education: years of schooling (GSS “educ”); continuous.
- For each genre g:
  - Dislike indicator Y_g = 1 if response is 4 or 5; Y_g = 0 if response is 1, 2, or 3.
  - Treat “don’t know much about it” and “no answer” as missing for that genre.
- Musical tolerance for genre g (TOL_g):
  - Count of the number of other genres (the 17 genres ≠ g) that respondent does not dislike (i.e., responses 1, 2, or 3). Equivalently, TOL_g = 17 − (number of other genres disliked).
  - This is “the reverse of the exclusiveness score minus the dependent variable,” constructed so the target genre g is excluded from the tolerance count.
- Genre audience education (for overlay line): For each genre g, compute the mean years of education among respondents who “reported liking that genre,” i.e., responses 1 or 2 (“like very much” or “like it”) to genre g. Exclude missing/“don’t know” on that genre and missing education.
- Sample mean education: overall mean years of education (same survey sample used in the figure; exclude missing education).

Modeling steps to obtain the plotted coefficients
- For each genre g (18 separate models), estimate a logistic regression:
  - Dependent variable: Y_g (1 = dislikes the genre; 0 = does not dislike).
  - Predictors: TOL_g (primary variable of interest) and Education (years).
  - Link: logit; report the coefficient on TOL_g.
  - Interpretation: coefficient is the change in log-odds of disliking genre g per one additional genre not disliked among the other 17.
  - All “don’t know”/“no answer” responses for the dependent genre are excluded; respondents must have sufficient non-missing data to compute TOL_g and have non-missing education.
- Result used in the plot: the estimated TOL_g coefficient for each genre. All are negative and statistically significant at p < .0001 (as noted in the figure).

How to order the x-axis
- Rank genres by the size of the TOL_g coefficient (most negative to least negative).
  - Left side = genres least often disliked by musically tolerant respondents (largest-magnitude negative coefficients; e.g., Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B).
  - Right side = genres more often disliked even by musically tolerant respondents (coefficients closer to zero; e.g., Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel).
  - Reggae lies closer to the center.

Plotting details to reproduce Figure 1
- Title: “The Effect of Being Musically Tolerant on Disliking Each Music Genre Compared to the Educational Composition of Genre Audiences”.
- X-axis: “Type of Music”; 18 category labels (listed above) placed in the order defined by the ranked TOL_g coefficients.
- Left Y-axis:
  - Label: “Coefficients for Musical Tolerance as it Affects the Probability of Disliking Each Music Genre”.
  - Scale: negative values, approximately from −0.5 to −0.1 with tick marks at −0.1 increments.
  - Series: “Coefficient for Musical Tolerance” — plot the 18 TOL_g coefficients as a solid line with point markers (one per genre).
- Right Y-axis:
  - Label: “Mean Educational Level of Respondents Who Report Liking Each Music Genre”.
  - Units: years of education.
  - Scale: roughly 9 to 15 years (choose ticks to match the original appearance).
  - Series 1: “Mean Education of Genre Audience” — dashed line connecting the 18 per-genre means (computed among likers: responses 1 or 2), aligned to the x-axis categories.
  - Series 2: “Sample Mean Education” — horizontal dotted line at the overall mean years of education.
- Legend/annotations:
  - Three series labels as above.
  - Note under the figure: “Coefficients represent the effects of being musically tolerant (number of genres not disliked, excluding the one involved in the dependent variable) from logistic regression equations where disliking each genre is the dependent variable and education is controlled. All coefficients are significant at p < .0001.”
- Transformations:
  - Only the logistic (log-odds) modeling; plotted values are untransformed coefficients.
- Missing data handling:
  - For constructing Y_g: exclude “don’t know much about it” and “no answer”.
  - For TOL_g: base the count on the other 17 genres; respondents with missing on those other items cannot contribute to TOL_g for that genre (drop if TOL_g cannot be computed). Education must be non-missing.
- Weighting: Not indicated; analyses appear unweighted.

What the figure overlays are meant to show
- The solid line (left axis) shows how strongly general musical tolerance reduces the odds of disliking each genre (controlling for education).
- The dashed line (right axis) shows mean education among “fans” of each genre (likers).
- The dotted horizontal line marks the sample’s mean education, for reference.

Minimal replication checklist
1) Load GSS 1993 and keep respondents with non-missing “educ”.
2) For each of the 18 genres, recode 1–3 = not disliked; 4–5 = disliked; DK/NA = missing.
3) For each genre g:
   - Compute TOL_g = count of not-disliked across the other 17 genres.
   - Regress Y_g on TOL_g and educ via logit; store coef(TOL_g).
   - Compute mean(educ) among likers (responses 1 or 2) of g.
4) Rank genres by coef(TOL_g) from most negative to least negative; re-order both series accordingly.
5) Plot:
   - Left axis: coef(TOL_g) as solid line with markers.
   - Right axis: per-genre mean(educ) as dashed line; add a dotted horizontal line at overall mean(educ).
   - Add the title, axis labels, series labels, and the footnote text about model specification and p-values.
