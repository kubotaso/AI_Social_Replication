Discrepancy report (ground-truth vs. your generated figure)

What matches
- Two y-axes, left range −0.5…−0.1 and right range 12…15.
- X categories and order mostly match.
- Dotted horizontal reference line at y2=13 is present.
- No legend (labels are done via annotations).

Exact discrepancies
1) Line–style mapping is reversed
- Ground-truth: Coefficient for Musical Tolerance = solid black line. Mean Education of Genre Audience = black dash–dot line.
- Generated: Mean Education is drawn as a solid line; the coefficient series is dash–dot.

2) Annotations point to the wrong items/are poorly placed
- “Mean Education of Genre Audience” arrow points to the coefficient series in the generated plot.
- “Coefficient for Musical Tolerance” text overlaps the left y-axis label and does not clearly point to the solid line.
- Arrow placement for “Sample Mean Education” is different (y is OK, but text should be above the dotted line with a short downward arrow).

3) One x tick label is wrong
- Ground-truth uses “Heavy Metal”; generated uses “Metal”.

4) Minor presentation differences
- The dash–dot pattern in the ground-truth is a long–dash/short–gap/dot/short–gap pattern; your dash–dot spacing looks different.
- Axis label spacing: the left y-axis label is cramped and overlaps with the annotation; the ground-truth has extra padding.
- Line widths are a touch thin compared to the original.

How to fix (data handling)
- Do not sort or re-order genres; use the exact sequence below:
  ["Latin/Salsa","Jazz","Blues/R&B","Show Tunes","Oldies","Classical","Reggae","Swing","New Age/Space","Opera","Bluegrass","Folk","Easy Listening","Pop/Rock","Rap","Heavy Metal","Country","Gospel"]
- Use the original coefficient vector and mean-education vector 1:1; no smoothing or interpolation; no aggregation across bins.
- Sample mean education is a single constant (13) used only for the horizontal reference line on the right y-axis.

Matplotlib code changes (exact calls to adjust)

- Ensure the two series are plotted on their intended axes with correct styles
  # x positions
  x = np.arange(len(genres))

  # Left axis: coefficients (solid black)
  ln_coef, = ax1.plot(x, coef, color='k', linestyle='-', linewidth=2.0, zorder=3)

  # Right axis: mean education (dash–dot black with custom pattern)
  ln_edu, = ax2.plot(x, mean_edu, color='k', linewidth=2.0, zorder=2)
  ln_edu.set_linestyle((0, (7, 3, 2, 3)))  # long dash, gap, dot, gap (closer to print original)

- Horizontal reference line and order
  ax2.axhline(13, color='0.45', linestyle=':', linewidth=1.2, zorder=1)

- X ticks (fix “Heavy Metal” and ensure order)
  ax1.set_xticks(x)
  ax1.set_xticklabels(genres, rotation=45, ha='right')

- Axis ranges and ticks (match exactly)
  ax1.set_ylim(-0.5, -0.1)
  ax1.set_yticks(np.arange(-0.5, -0.09, 0.1))
  ax2.set_ylim(12, 15)
  ax2.set_yticks([12, 13, 14, 15])

- Improve axis/spine visual parity with the original
  for s in ['left','right','top','bottom']:
      ax1.spines[s].set_linewidth(1.5)
  ax2.spines['right'].set_linewidth(1.5)
  ax1.tick_params(direction='out', width=1.2)
  ax2.tick_params(direction='out', width=1.2)

- Correct the annotations and arrows (put them on the correct axes and positions)
  # Mean education label/arrow (attach to ax2 so y uses the right scale)
  ax2.annotate('Mean Education of Genre Audience',
               xy=(9, mean_edu[9]), xycoords='data',
               xytext=(2.0, 14.6), textcoords='data',
               arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', lw=1.2),
               ha='left', va='bottom', annotation_clip=False)

  # Coefficient label/arrow (attach to ax1 so y uses the left scale)
  ax1.annotate('Coefficient for Musical Tolerance',
               xy=(1, coef[1]), xycoords='data',
               xytext=(-0.4, -0.43), textcoords='data',
               arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', lw=1.2),
               ha='left', va='top', annotation_clip=False)

  # Sample mean education label/arrow (short arrow down to dotted line)
  ax2.annotate('Sample Mean Education',
               xy=(8.0, 13), xycoords='data',
               xytext=(8.0, 13.15), textcoords='data',
               arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-|>', lw=1.0),
               ha='center', va='bottom', annotation_clip=False)

- Labels and padding (avoid overlap with annotations)
  ax1.set_ylabel("Coefficients for Musical Tolerance as It Affects One's Probability of Disliking Each Music Genre", labelpad=18)
  ax2.set_ylabel("Mean Educational Level of Respondents Who Reported Liking Each Music Genre", labelpad=18)
  ax1.set_xlabel("Type of Music")

- Keep the figure margins tight but not clipping text
  fig.tight_layout(rect=[0.02, 0.08, 0.98, 0.98])

Quick checklist to verify after changes
- Coefficient line is solid; mean-education line is dash–dot with long-dash/dot pattern.
- “Mean Education of Genre Audience” arrow touches the dash–dot line; “Coefficient for Musical Tolerance” arrow touches the solid line near the left side.
- X-label reads “Heavy Metal,” not “Metal.”
- Right axis spans 12–15 with ticks at 12, 13, 14, 15; left axis spans −0.5…−0.1 with 0.1 steps.
- Dotted horizontal line sits exactly at y2=13.
- No markers, no legend, black-and-white styling, thicker spines like the print original.
