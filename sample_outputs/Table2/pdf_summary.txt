Here is what Table 2 in Bryson (1996) reports, with the data source, variables, and statistical methods used to produce it.

Data source and sample
- Source: 1993 General Social Survey (GSS), culture module.
- Music items: Respondents rated 18 genres on a 5-point Likert scale from “like very much” to “dislike very much,” plus “don’t know.”
- Construction of dislikes: For each respondent, “dislike” and “dislike very much” responses are counted; “don’t know” treated as missing for that item.
- Subsamples for Table 2: Because the racism items were asked of subsets and combined into a single scale, valid N differs by model:
  - N = 644 for the minority-associated genres model.
  - N = 605 for the remaining-genres model.

Dependent variables in Table 2 (two separate counts)
- Dislike of rap, reggae, blues/R&B, jazz, gospel, and Latin music:
  - Count of dislikes across these six genres (chosen because they are disproportionately liked by Black or Hispanic respondents at p < .001).
- Dislike of the 12 remaining genres:
  - Count of dislikes across the other 12 genres: show tunes, oldies, classical/chamber, swing/big band, new age/space, opera, bluegrass, folk, pop/easy listening, contemporary rock, heavy metal, country/western.

Key independent variable (Table 2)
- Racism score (0–5; alpha = .54):
  - Five dichotomous items (coded in the racist direction), selected to maximize valid cases; one item removed after factor analysis.
  - Items:
    1) Objection to children attending a school where >50% of students are Black.
    2) Favor/oppose busing across districts (opposition coded as racist).
    3) Whether Black-White socioeconomic differences are mainly due to discrimination (denial coded as racist).
    4) … mainly due to lack of educational opportunity (denial coded as racist).
    5) … mainly due to lack of motivation/willpower (agreement coded as racist).

Control variables included in Table 2
- Education (years).
- Household income per capita.
- Occupational prestige (GSS prestige score).
- Female (indicator).
- Age (years).
- Race/ethnicity indicators: Black; Hispanic; Other race (reference = non-Hispanic White).
- Conservative Protestant (indicator).
- No religion (indicator).
- Southern (indicator).

Statistical methods for Table 2
- Two separate ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with standardized coefficients.
- Two-tailed significance tests; stars denote p-levels.
- Model fit reported as R2 and adjusted R2.
- Constants reported.

Table 2 regression models and coefficients
Model A: Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music (N = 644; R2 = .145; adj. R2 = .129; Constant = 2.415***)
- Racism score: .130**
- Education: −.175***
- Household income per capita: −.037
- Occupational prestige: −.020
- Female: −.057
- Age: .163***
- Black: −.132***
- Hispanic: −.058
- Other race: −.017
- Conservative Protestant: .063
- No religion: .057
- Southern: .024

Model B: Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres (N = 605; R2 = .147; adj. R2 = .130; Constant = 7.860)
- Racism score: .080 (ns)
- Education: −.242***
- Household income per capita: −.065
- Occupational prestige: .005
- Female: −.070
- Age: .126**
- Black: .042
- Hispanic: −.029
- Other race: .047
- Conservative Protestant: .048
- No religion: .024
- Southern: .069

How the dependent-genre sets were defined
- Minority-associated set (used in Model A): rap, reggae, blues/R&B, jazz, gospel, Latin. Each is disproportionately liked by Black or Hispanic respondents at p < .001 (e.g., 26% of rap “fans” are Black vs. 11% in the sample; 18% of gospel fans are Black; 13% of Latin fans are Hispanic).
- Remaining genres (used in Model B): the other 12 listed above.

Interpretive takeaway tied to Table 2
- Racism significantly predicts more dislikes of the minority-associated genres (Model A) but not of the remaining genres (Model B), net of education and other controls.
- Education consistently predicts fewer dislikes in both models.
