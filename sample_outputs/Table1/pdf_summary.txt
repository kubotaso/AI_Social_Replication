Here is what Table 1 contains and how it was estimated, plus the data source and variable construction it relies on.

Data source
- 1993 General Social Survey (GSS), NORC: stratified national sample of non-institutionalized U.S. adults.
- Music module asked all 1,606 respondents to rate 18 music genres on a 5-point Likert scale (1=like very much to 5=dislike very much) with a “don’t know much about it” option.

Dependent variable used in Table 1
- Musical exclusiveness (count): number of genres a respondent rated “dislike” or “dislike very much” across the 18 genres.
- “Don’t know” responses treated as missing; respondents with such responses were dropped for this outcome, leaving 912 valid cases overall before model-specific listwise deletion.
- Distribution in text: mean 5.78, SD 3.76, possible range 0–18.

Independent variables used in Table 1 (and coding)
- Education: years of schooling (continuous).
- Household income per capita: household income divided by household size (continuous).
- Occupational prestige: NORC occupational prestige score (continuous).
- Female: 1=female, 0=male.
- Age: in years (continuous).
- Race/ethnicity indicators (reference: non-Hispanic White): Black; Hispanic; Other race.
- Religion indicators (reference: all others): Conservative Protestant; No religion.
- Region: Southern (1=resident in South).
- Political intolerance: additive 0–15 scale counting “intolerant” responses to 15 Stouffer-style civil liberties items (allow speech, teach, library book) for five target groups (anti-religion, racist, communist, pro–military rule, homosexual). Reliability alpha=.916. Asked of two-thirds of the GSS sample.

Statistical methods for Table 1
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions with standardized coefficients (betas) reported.
- Three nested specifications; two-tailed significance tests with p<.05, .01, .001 denoted by *, **, ***.
- Model Ns reflect listwise deletion and the fact the intolerance battery was asked of only two-thirds of respondents.
- Fit statistics reported: R2, adjusted R2, constant.

Regression models in Table 1 and all included variables
1) SES Model (N=787; R2=.107; Adj R2=.104; Constant=10.920)
   - Education: −.322*** (fewer dislikes with more schooling)
   - Household income per capita: −.037 (ns)
   - Occupational prestige: .016 (ns)

2) Demographic Model (adds group-identity controls) (N=756; R2=.151; Adj R2=.139; Constant=8.507)
   - Education: −.246***
   - Household income per capita: −.054 (ns)
   - Occupational prestige: −.006 (ns)
   - Female: −.083* (women report fewer dislikes → men more exclusive)
   - Age: .140*** (older → more dislikes)
   - Black: .029 (ns)
   - Hispanic: −.029 (ns)
   - Other race: .005 (ns)
   - Conservative Protestant: .059 (ns)
   - No religion: −.012 (ns)
   - Southern: .097** (South → more dislikes)

3) Political Intolerance Model (adds intolerance scale) (N=503; R2=.169; Adj R2=.148; Constant=6.516)
   - Education: −.151**
   - Household income per capita: −.009 (ns)
   - Occupational prestige: −.022 (ns)
   - Female: −.095*
   - Age: .110*
   - Black: .049 (ns)
   - Hispanic: .031 (ns)
   - Other race: .053 (ns)
   - Conservative Protestant: .066 (ns)
   - No religion: .024 (ns)
   - Southern: .121**
   - Political intolerance: .164*** (more politically intolerant → more musical dislikes)

- Table 2: Two OLS models splitting the dependent variable into (a) dislikes of six genres disproportionately liked by Black/Hispanic respondents (rap, reggae, blues/R&B, jazz, gospel, Latin) and (b) dislikes of the other 12 genres; key added predictor is a 0–5 racism scale (alpha=.54) built from GSS racial attitude items.
- Table 3: Frequencies for the 18 genre ratings (shows overall like/dislike distributions, useful for understanding the dependent variable’s construction).
- Figure 1 (not a table): Logistic regressions of disliking each genre on “musical tolerance” (number of genres not disliked) controlling for education.

Bottom line from Table 1
- Education robustly decreases musical exclusiveness; income and occupational prestige are negligible once education is controlled.
- Political intolerance positively predicts musical exclusiveness.
- Men, older adults, and Southerners report more dislikes, net of SES and intolerance.
