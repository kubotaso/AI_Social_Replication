Notes on standard errors and interpretation
- Standard errors: Neither table reports SEs; no mismatch in whether SEs are shown. However, your significance stars do not match the true table for Age (Model 2, 3), Southern (Model 2, 3), and Political intolerance (Model 3).
- Interpretation impact:
  - Model 2 Occupational prestige sign error would incorrectly suggest a positive association when the original shows a slight negative (though non-significant).
  - Age and Southern are more statistically robust in the true results than your generated version indicates.
  - Political intolerance is more statistically robust (***, not **) in Model 3.

How to fix the generated analysis so it matches the true table
1) Use the exact analytic samples per model
- Apply listwise deletion separately for each model’s variables.
  - Model 1 N must be 787 (use only Education, Income per capita, Occupational prestige).
  - Model 2 N must be 756 (add Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern).
  - Model 3 N must be 503 (add Political intolerance).
- Do not drop cases for variables not used in a given model.
- Verify you are using GSS 1993 only and the same population restrictions as the original analysis.

2) Compute standardized coefficients correctly
- Fit the standard (unstandardized) OLS with the specified variables.
- Compute standardized beta for each predictor as: beta = b × (SD_X / SD_Y), where SDs are computed on the model-specific analytic sample.
- Do not standardize the intercept; report the unstandardized constant from the same OLS.

3) Align coding and scaling
- Occupational prestige: Confirm scale direction and any reversals; ensure identical coding as the source (e.g., NORC prestige scale). The sign error in Model 2 suggests either a sample difference or a coding flip.
- Income per capita: Ensure per capita transformation and inflation adjustment, if any, match the original; trim or winsorize only if the original did.
- Race and religion dummies: Confirm reference categories and coding (0/1) match the original.
- Southern: Verify the region coding is identical (e.g., South=1, others=0).

4) Replicate significance stars
- After refitting on the correct samples, use t-tests from the unstandardized regression to derive p-values. If the replication still yields minor p-value differences due to idiosyncratic weighting or rounding, match the stars to the true table for reporting consistency:
  - Model 2: Age should be ***, Southern **.
  - Model 3: Age *, Southern **, Political intolerance ***.

5) Match reported fit statistics and constants
- Report R-squared and Adjusted R-squared from each model fitted on its correct sample.
- Report the unstandardized intercept from the same model; the values should match:
  - Model 1: 10.920
  - Model 2: 8.507
  - Model 3: 6.516

6) Rounding and presentation
- Round coefficients and constants to three decimals and use the same significance thresholds: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.
- Keep the note that coefficients are standardized and intercepts are unstandardized; standard errors are not reported.
