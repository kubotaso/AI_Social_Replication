Mapping from analysis concepts to GSS 1993 data fields and recodes

General sample and missing data rules
- Restrict to year==1993 (variable: year).
- Treat all non-substantive codes as missing (e.g., NA(d), NA(n), NA(r), NA(p), NA(i), NA(s), etc.) for all variables listed below.
- Listwise deletion is by model: Models 1–2 require the dependent variable and their included predictors; Model 3 additionally requires the intolerance scale.
- Standardization for Table 1: For each model, z-score the dependent variable and all predictors used in that model before OLS to obtain standardized coefficients.

Dependent variable: Musical exclusiveness (count of disliked genres, 0–18)
- Source fields (18 music items; response scale 1–5 with “don’t know” treated as missing):
  • bigband, blugrass, country, blues, musicals, classicl, folk, gospel, jazz, latin, moodeasy, newage, opera, rap, reggae, conrock, oldies, hvymetal
- Coding:
  • For each genre g in the 18-item set, define dislike_g = 1 if g in {4, 5}; else 0 if g in {1, 2, 3}; missing if g is any NA code (including don’t know).
  • Drop respondent from the DV if any of the 18 genre items is missing (i.e., require non-missing across all 18).
  • Musical exclusiveness = sum(dislike_g) across the 18 genres. Range 0–18.

Independent variables and recodes

Socioeconomic status variables
- Education (years of schooling; continuous)
  • Field: educ
  • Use numeric years as provided.

- Household income per capita (continuous)
  • Numerator field: realinc (family income in constant dollars).
  • Denominator field: hompop (household size; ensure hompop>=1).
  • Coding: income_pc = realinc / hompop.
  • Missing if either realinc or hompop is missing or if hompop < 1.

- Occupational prestige (continuous)
  • Field: prestg80
  • Use as provided.

Demographic controls
- Female (indicator)
  • Source field: sex (1=male, 2=female).
  • Coding: female = 1 if sex==2; 0 if sex==1; missing otherwise.

- Age (years; continuous)
  • Field: age
  • Use numeric age as provided (treat “89 or older” as 89).

Race/ethnicity indicators (reference: non-Hispanic White)
- Source fields: race (1 white / 2 black / 3 other) and ethnic (country/region of family origin).
- Hispanic indicator (1/0):
  • Hispanic = 1 if ethnic in any of the following Spanish-origin codes:
    - Spain and “other Spanish”: 25, 38
    - Mexico and Puerto Rico: 17, 22
    - Central America (Spanish-speaking): 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 699
      (exclude 601 Belize)
    - South America (Spanish-speaking): 501, 502, 504, 505, 506, 509, 510, 512, 513
      (exclude 503 Brazil, 507 French Guiana, 508 Guyana, 511 Suriname)
    - Caribbean (Spanish-speaking): 801 (Cuba), 803 (Dominican Republic)
  • Hispanic = 0 otherwise or if ethnic is missing.
- Black indicator (1/0):
  • black = 1 if race==2 AND Hispanic==0; else 0.
- Other race indicator (1/0):
  • other_race = 1 if race==3 AND Hispanic==0; else 0.
- Reference group (implicit in regression): non-Hispanic white = respondents with race==1 AND Hispanic==0.

Religion indicators (reference: all others)
- Source fields: relig, denom (coarse 7-category recode).
- No religion (indicator)
  • no_relig = 1 if relig==4; else 0.
- Conservative Protestant (indicator; approximation using available fields)
  • cons_prot = 1 if relig==1 (Protestant) AND denom in {1 Baptist, 6 Other denomination, 7 No denomination or non-denominational church}; else 0.
  • All remaining respondents (including other Protestants, Catholics, Jews, other faiths) fall in the reference category when both cons_prot==0 and no_relig==0.

Region
- Southern (indicator)
  • Source field: region (1 Northeast / 2 Midwest / 3 South / 4 West).
  • southern = 1 if region==3; else 0.

Political intolerance scale (0–15; count of “intolerant” responses across 15 Stouffer items)
- Items and “intolerant” coding (1 point each when the intolerant response is chosen; 0 otherwise):
  • Anti-religionist: spkath (2=not allowed), colath (5=not allowed to teach), libath (1=remove)
  • Racist:          spkrac (2=not allowed), colrac (5=not allowed to teach), librac (1=remove)
  • Communist:       spkcom (2=not allowed), colcom (4=yes, fired),    libcom (1=remove)
  • Pro–military rule: spkmil (2=not allowed), colmil (5=not allowed to teach), libmil (1=remove)
  • Homosexual:      spkhomo (2=not allowed), colhomo (5=not allowed to teach), libhomo (1=remove)
- Scoring:
  • For each item, intolerant_i = 1 if the response matches the value above; intolerant_i = 0 if the alternative tolerant response is chosen; missing otherwise.
  • Political intolerance = sum(intolerant_i) across the 15 items.
  • For Model 3, require non-missing on all 15 items (i.e., complete cases for the scale).
