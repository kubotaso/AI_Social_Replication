Score: 69/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories (missing or extra rows)

### Mismatch: Missing nonresponse rows in the Generated Results
In the generated table, the two “M” rows are present but **all zeros**:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it** → generated = 0 for every genre  
- **(M) No answer** → generated = 0 for every genre

In the true table, these rows have **nonzero counts for every genre** (and they vary by genre).

#### How to fix
Replace the generated all-zero “M” rows with the **true counts** shown in the true table for each genre (see Section 2 below). This is not a rounding issue—these are entirely missing values that must be carried through from the data.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by cell)

### Good news: The 1–5 attitude category counts match exactly
For every genre, the generated counts for:

1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  

**match the true table exactly**.

So there are **no mismatches** in the substantive (1)–(5) response-category frequencies.

### Actual mismatches: All “M” counts are wrong (zeros vs true nonzero)

Below are the **true** values that must replace the generated zeros.

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa … Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2 (Reggae … Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening … Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

#### How to fix
Populate those two rows with these counts. If your “generated analysis” came from code, it likely **dropped missing values instead of tabulating them**. You need to:
- Treat “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” as **explicit categories**, not as NA to be removed; or
- If they are coded as special missing (e.g., 8/9, 98/99), ensure your frequency table **includes** them.

---

## 3) Percentages (missing entirely)

### Mismatch: Generated output contains no percentages
Your prompt asks to compare “frequency counts or percentages,” but:

- **True table** is labeled “Frequency Distributions” but shows **counts only** (no % shown).
- **Generated table** also shows **counts only** (no % shown).

So there is **no count-vs-% mismatch**, but there *is* a mismatch with the requirement if the generated output was supposed to include percentages.

#### How to fix (if percentages are required)
Add columns/rows of percentages computed as:
- **% of total including M and No answer** (denominator = total responses for that genre), or
- **% of valid responses only** (denominator excludes M categories)

Be explicit which denominator you use—because adding the missing M counts changes totals substantially.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: They match the true table
The generated **Mean** row values match the true table for all genres (e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Heavy Metal 4.12, etc.).

### But there is an implied inconsistency risk
Even though the means match, the generated table’s **zeros for M categories imply a different N** than the true table. That would typically affect:
- totals per genre
- valid N / missing N reporting
- percentages (if computed)
- any weighted mean computation if missing-handling differs

The only way the mean can still match is if the mean is computed **only on valid 1–5 responses** (excluding M categories). That appears to be what happened.

#### How to fix
To make the generated analysis fully consistent with the true table:
- Keep the mean computation as “valid-only” (1–5), **and**
- Also correctly report the missing-category counts (M rows), **and/or**
- Add an explicit “Valid N” and “Total N” per genre so it’s clear what the mean is based on.

## 5) Column items/categories (missing/extra columns; naming issues)

### Genre columns: Same set of 18 genres, but one label is malformed in Generated Results
The generated header shows:

- **“New Age/Space Opera”** as a single column label

But the true table has **two separate genres**:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

In the generated table, the counts appear under two separate columns anyway (you have both “New Age/Space” counts and “Opera” counts), but the header text is merged/misprinted as “New Age/Space Opera”.

#### How to fix
Split/rename the column headers so they exactly match the true table:
- Column should be **New Age/Space**
- Next column should be **Opera**

This is a labeling/formatting defect, not a numeric one, but it *is* a category-name mismatch.

# Exact list of mismatches to correct

1) **(M) Don’t know much about it** row: generated all zeros; true has nonzero counts for every genre → replace with true values.  
2) **(M) No answer** row: generated all zeros; true has nonzero counts for every genre → replace with true values.  
3) **Column header issue**: generated merges/garbles “New Age/Space” and “Opera” (“New Age/Space Opera”) → rename/split headers to match true table.

Everything else (the 1–5 frequency counts and the means) matches the true table.
