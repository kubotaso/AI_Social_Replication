Score: 62/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: **mismatches and missing rows**
Your **Generated Results** include only these 8 rows (implicitly, by position):

1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
6. (row of all zeros)  
7. (row of all zeros)  
8. Mean  

But the **True Table (Table 3)** has **8 rows too**, and rows 6–7 are **not zeros**; they are:

6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
7. **(M) No answer**  
8. Mean  

So the generated table is **missing the two “M” categories** (they exist in the true results), and instead shows **two all-zero rows**, which is incorrect.

**Fix:** Add the two missing response categories and populate them with the correct counts (see Section 2). Do not include extra all-zero rows.

---

### 2) Frequency counts: **every discrepancy**
Rows (1)–(5) and Mean match the true table for all 18 genres. The **only count mismatches** are that the generated table has zeros where the true table has values for the two “M” rows.

Below are the required replacements for the two all-zero rows:

#### Replace generated all-zero row #6 with: **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### Replace generated all-zero row #7 with: **(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Net effect:** the generated table currently **understates the total N for every genre** by exactly the amount in these two missing “M” rows.

---

### 3) Percentages: **missing / cannot be verified**
You asked to check “frequency counts or percentages,” but the **Generated Results contain no percentages at all**, and the True Table also reports **counts (not percentages)** plus means.

**Fix (if you intended percentages):**
- Compute percentages using the correct denominators. Important: Table 3 includes “Don’t know” and “No answer” as separate rows, so you must decide whether percentages should be:
  - out of **all cases including M**, or
  - out of **valid responses only** (1–5), excluding M categories.
- Then add percentage columns/values consistently for each genre.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.): mismatches
- **Means:** The generated means match the true means (to the displayed precision) for all genres.
- **Totals / N:** The generated table does **not** provide totals, but because it has zeros for the two M rows, any total you compute from the generated rows would be **wrong**.

**Fix:** After inserting correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” rows, totals per genre will match the true table. (Optionally add a “Total” row to make this explicit.)

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories
- **Columns (genres):** The generated table includes the same **18 genres** as the true Table 3, with matching names.
- **No extra/missing genre columns** detected.

The only structural problem is the **missing two response-category rows** (replaced by zeros).

---

## What to change so generated output matches the true table
1. Label rows explicitly (don’t rely on row order).
2. Replace the two all-zero rows with:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it” (counts listed above)
   - “(M) No answer” (counts listed above)
3. (Optional) Add totals and/or percentages, but only after deciding whether M categories are included in denominators.
