Score: 55/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatched (names and number of items)

### A. Missing response categories (rows)
Your **Generated Results** table includes only these rows, in order:

1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
6. **0 row**  
7. **0 row**  
8. Mean  

But the **True Results (Table 3)** has **7 response categories + mean**:

- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
- **(M) No answer**  
- Mean  

So the generated table is **missing two required rows**:
- “Don’t know much about it”
- “No answer”

…and instead it contains **two extra rows of all zeros**, which are incorrect placeholders.

**How to fix**
- Add the two missing rows and populate them with the correct counts from the true table.
- Remove the two all-zero rows entirely.
- Label rows exactly as in the true table (or at least clearly as “Don’t know” and “No answer”).

## 2) Frequency count mismatches

### A. All “Don’t know much about it” counts are wrong
In the generated table, the 6th row is all zeros for every genre. In truth, “Don’t know much about it” has nonzero values for every genre.

**Correct “Don’t know much about it” counts (must be inserted):**

- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

### B. All “No answer” counts are wrong
In the generated table, the 7th row is also all zeros. In truth, “No answer” has small nonzero values.

**Correct “No answer” counts (must be inserted):**

- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

### C. Counts for categories (1)–(5) match
For all 18 genres, the generated counts for:
- Like very much
- Like it
- Mixed feelings
- Dislike it
- Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly**.

So the only frequency mismatches are entirely due to the two missing “M” categories being replaced by zeros.

---

## 3) Percentages
The true table shown provides **counts only**, not percentages. The generated output also provides counts only (plus mean). So:

- No percentage mismatches can be assessed because **no percentages are displayed**.
- If your generated analysis elsewhere produced percentages, they would necessarily be wrong unless they incorporated the missing “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts in the denominator.

**How to fix (if percentages are needed)**
- Compute percentages using the full total per genre:
  \[
  N = (1)+(2)+(3)+(4)+(5)+DK+NA
  \]
- Then percentage for each response = count / N × 100.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### A. Means match (with rounding)
The final “Mean” row in the generated table matches the true means (differences only in displayed precision). Examples:

- Latin/Salsa: generated **3.142753** vs true **3.14**
- Jazz: generated **2.60528** vs true **2.61**
- Heavy Metal: generated **4.122543** vs true **4.12**

So **no mean values are incorrect**; only rounding/format differs.

### B. Totals/case counts are not shown
Neither table shows totals per genre, but if you computed them, they would be wrong in the generated version unless you include DK and NA.

**How to fix**
- If you report totals, compute them including DK and NA (since true table includes them).

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories (genres)

### A. Column set matches the true table
All 18 genres appear in the generated output:

Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No extra genres, none missing.

### B. Structural issue: true table is split into 3 subtables; generated is one wide table
That’s not a numerical mismatch, but it can cause alignment/labeling errors (like the missing “M” rows).

**How to fix**
- Either:
  - keep as one wide table but ensure all 7 response categories + mean are included, or
  - reproduce the true formatting: 3 subtables of 6 genres each.

---

# Summary of every mismatch
1. **Row category mismatch:** “Don’t know much about it” missing → replaced by a zero row.  
2. **Row category mismatch:** “No answer” missing → replaced by a second zero row.  
3. **Frequency mismatches:** All DK and NA counts are wrong (0 instead of true nonzero values).  
4. **Means:** correct (only formatting/rounding differs).  
5. **Columns/genres:** correct; no missing/extra genres.

---

## Exact correction you should make to the generated table
Replace the two all-zero rows with:

- Row 6 = “(M) Don’t know much about it” with the 18 correct DK counts listed above.
- Row 7 = “(M) No answer” with the 18 correct NA counts listed above.

After that change, the generated frequency table will match the true Table 3 (aside from mean rounding and table layout).
