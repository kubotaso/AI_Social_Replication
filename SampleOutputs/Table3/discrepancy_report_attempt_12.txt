Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing vs. present

### Missing rows in the *Generated Results*
Your generated table includes rows for (1)–(5), then two rows of **all zeros**, then Mean. In the true table, those two rows are **not zeros**; they are real missing-data categories:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it** — **missing entirely** in generated output (replaced by a zero row)
- **(M) No answer** — **missing entirely** in generated output (replaced by a zero row)

**How to fix:** Replace the two “0 … 0” rows with the correct counts for:
1) “Don’t know much about it”
2) “No answer”
for every genre column.

### Category labeling discrepancy (minor but real)
In your generated header you have **“New Age/Space”** merged as “New Age/Space” (looks like “New Age/Space” but the true label is **New Age/Space** and **Opera** is a separate column. Your generated header shows **“New Age/Space Opera”** as if it were one combined label.

**How to fix:** Split into two separate columns exactly as in the true table:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

(Your numbers suggest you *did* treat them as two columns—48,73 etc.—but the header text is wrong/ambiguous.)

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

All (1)–(5) counts match the true table **for every genre**.

The **only count mismatches** are the two missing-data rows, which are incorrectly shown as all zeros in the generated table.

### Correct values that should replace the two all-zero rows

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
Replace zero row #1 with **Don’t know much about it**:
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

Replace zero row #2 with **No answer**:
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
Don’t know much about it:
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

No answer:
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
Don’t know much about it:
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

No answer:
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix:** Insert these exact rows (with labels) in the generated table instead of zeros.

---

## 3) Percentages
The generated output shows **counts only** and provides **no percentages**, while your mismatch checklist includes “percentages.”

- True table also provides **counts only** (no percentages shown).
- So there’s **no percentage mismatch to evaluate**, but if your generated analysis *was supposed to include percentages*, that would be a “missing column/statistic” issue.

**How to fix (only if required):** Add percentage columns (or a second table) computed as:
\[
\% = \frac{\text{cell count}}{\text{column total (including missing categories as appropriate)}} \times 100
\]
But note: you must decide whether the denominator includes/excludes “Don’t know” and “No answer” and match whatever the “true” spec uses.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
All means in the generated table match the true table exactly:

- Panel 1 means: 3.14, 2.61, 2.50, 2.59, 2.25, 2.67
- Panel 2 means: 3.15, 2.45, 3.68, 3.48, 2.67, 2.76
- Panel 3 means: 2.41, 2.67, 3.92, 4.12, 2.32, 2.39

### Totals / Ns (not shown)
Neither table displays column totals (Ns). However, because your generated table incorrectly sets the missing categories to zero, any computed **N**, valid-N, or missingness rates derived from it would be wrong.

**How to fix:** After inserting the correct missing rows, recompute any totals/Ns if your analysis reports them.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns present
All 18 genres are present in both outputs.

### Column naming issue
As noted above, the generated header text **“New Age/Space Opera”** is incorrect/ambiguous relative to the true table which has **two separate columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera.”

**How to fix:** Correct the header to explicitly separate those two columns.

---

# Bottom line: what’s wrong and how to make it match
1) **Replace the two all-zero rows** with the true counts for **(M) Don’t know much about it** and **(M) No answer** (values listed above).
2) **Fix the header labeling** so **New Age/Space** and **Opera** are distinct columns (not a fused label).
3) If you output any totals/percentages in the “generated analysis,” recompute them after correcting missing-data rows.
