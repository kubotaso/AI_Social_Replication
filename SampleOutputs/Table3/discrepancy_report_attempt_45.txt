Score: 75/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: **mismatches and missing items**

**Generated table is missing two required attitude categories** that are present in the true Table 3:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In your generated output, those two rows appear as:
- a row of **NaN** (all columns)
- another row of **NaN** (all columns)

So the *row labels/categories are incomplete* (you effectively have 5 valid attitude rows + 2 blank rows + Mean), whereas the true table has:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

**How to fix**
- Populate the two missing “M” rows with the correct counts (see section 2).
- Ensure the output includes the row labels, not just raw numeric rows.

### 2) Frequency counts: **all mismatches**

For the first five response categories **(1)–(5)**, the generated counts **match** the true table for all 18 genres.

The **only frequency-count mismatches** are the two missing “M” rows, which should not be NaN. Below are the correct values you must insert.

#### Missing row: **(M) Don’t know much about it** (currently NaN)
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### Missing row: **(M) No answer** (currently NaN)
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- Add these two rows with these counts.
- If you’re computing them from data, make sure your code is not dropping/recoding these missing categories into NA/NaN (e.g., using `dropna=True` or failing to include missing-value categories in a crosstab).

---

### 3) Percentages: **missing entirely**
Your generated output shows **counts and means only**. The user request asks to check “frequency counts or percentages.” The **true table provides counts** (not percentages). So:

- There is **no percentage mismatch** with the true table (since the true table doesn’t report percentages),
- but if your “generated analysis” was supposed to include percentages, then **percent columns are missing** from the generated output.

**How to fix (if percentages are required)**
- Compute percentages **within each genre column** using the column total (including the two M rows if you want percentages of all responses).
- Add percentage columns or a second table.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.): mismatches

#### Means
The generated means:
- Latin/Salsa **3.142753** vs true **3.14**
- Jazz **2.60528** vs true **2.61**
- … etc.

These are **not real mismatches**—the generated values are simply **more precise**, while the published table is **rounded to two decimals**.

**How to fix**
- Round means to **2 decimal places** to match the true table formatting (e.g., `round(2)`).

#### Totals / N
The true table does not explicitly show totals per genre, but the counts imply a total N per genre (including the M rows). Your generated output does not show totals, so nothing to directly compare—but your NaN rows mean that if you computed totals, they would be wrong/incomplete.

**How to fix**
- After inserting the missing M counts, (optional) add a “Total” row/column if you want explicit N; it should match the sum of all 7 response categories per genre.

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories

**Columns (genres) match perfectly** between generated and true tables:
- Same **18 genres**, no extras, none missing.
- Names appear consistent (e.g., “Classical/Chamber”, “Swing/Big Band”, etc.).

**How to fix**
- No column fixes needed.

---

## Bottom line: what must change for the generated table to match the true table
1. Replace the two NaN rows with the correct counts for:
   - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
   - **(M) No answer**
2. Add/restore the **row labels** for all categories (1–5, M, M, Mean).
3. Round means to **two decimals** if you want exact visual agreement with the printed table.

Everything else (the five main attitude-category counts and the set of 18 genres) already matches the true results.
