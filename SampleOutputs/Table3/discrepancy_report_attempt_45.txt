Score: 77/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: mismatches in names/structure
- **“Opera” column label is wrong in the Generated Results.**
  - **Generated:** `New Age/Space Opera` appears as *one* genre/column.
  - **True:** there are **two separate columns**: `New Age/Space` **and** `Opera`.
  - **Fix:** Split the generated combined column into **two distinct variables/columns** (`New Age/Space` and `Opera`) and report each one’s frequencies/means separately.

All other attitude row labels exist in both (1–5, “Don’t know much about it”, “No answer”, Mean). The main structural issue is the **column naming/merging** above.

---

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/column)

#### Panel 1 genres (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)

For the first five response categories (1)–(5), the Generated counts match the True table.  
The mismatches are entirely in the missing-data rows:

**Row: (M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa: **Generated 108** vs **True 221** (off by -113)
- Jazz: **7** vs **38** (off by -31)
- Blues/R&B: **10** vs **56** (off by -46)
- Show Tunes: **23** vs **77** (off by -54)
- Oldies: **6** vs **41** (off by -35)
- Classical/Chamber: **19** vs **66** (off by -47)

**Row: (M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa: **125** vs **12** (off by +113)
- Jazz: **46** vs **15** (off by +31)
- Blues/R&B: **58** vs **12** (off by +46)
- Show Tunes: **68** vs **14** (off by +54)
- Oldies: **45** vs **10** (off by +35)
- Classical/Chamber: **58** vs **11** (off by +47)

**Pattern:** For every Panel 1 genre, the Generated “Don’t know” is too low by exactly the amount that “No answer” is too high.  
- **Fix:** You have swapped/misclassified a large set of cases between **“Don’t know much about it”** and **“No answer”** for these columns. Recode missing values so that:
  - “Don’t know” (the GSS “don’t know” code) maps to the “Don’t know much about it” row.
  - “No answer” (refused/blank/NA) maps to the “No answer” row.
  - Do **not** combine them or invert them.

#### Panel 2 genres (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)

For (1)–(5), the counts match the True table for the shown columns; the mismatches again are in missing-data rows, plus the Opera/New Age structural problem.

**Row: (M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae: **Generated 190** vs **True 295** (off by -105)
- Swing/Big Band: **86** vs **164** (off by -78)
- New Age/Space: **179** vs **292** (off by -113)
- Opera: **34** vs **83** (off by -49)
- Bluegrass: **78** vs **163** (off by -85)
- Folk: **15** vs **78** (off by -63)

**Row: (M) No answer**
- Reggae: **116** vs **11** (off by +105)
- Swing/Big Band: **90** vs **12** (off by +78)
- New Age/Space: **127** vs **14** (off by +113)
- Opera: **62** vs **13** (off by +49)
- Bluegrass: **96** vs **11** (off by +85)
- Folk: **75** vs **12** (off by +63)

**Pattern:** Same swap as Panel 1: the differences are equal-and-opposite between the two missing rows.  
- **Fix:** Same as above—your coding is pushing “Don’t know” responses into “No answer.”

**Additional fix due to the column merge:**
- Because Generated combined `New Age/Space Opera` into one label, you need to ensure you are not accidentally:
  - concatenating variable labels, or
  - summing/overlaying two variables into one output column.
- Output should have **two columns** with the True counts:
  - New Age/Space: (DK=292, NA=14)
  - Opera: (DK=83, NA=13)

#### Panel 3 genres (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)

Here, the first five categories match, but missing-data rows are wrong.

**Row: (M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **Generated 24** vs **True 72** (off by -48)
- Contemporary Rock: **10** vs **50** (off by -40)
- Rap: **15** vs **61** (off by -46)
- Heavy Metal: **10** vs **70** (off by -60)
- Country/Western: **3** vs **22** (off by -19)
- Gospel: **14** vs **35** (off by -21)

**Row: (M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **61** vs **13** (off by +48)
- Contemporary Rock: **52** vs **12** (off by +40)
- Rap: **57** vs **11** (off by +46)
- Heavy Metal: **70** vs **10** (off by +60)
- Country/Western: **29** vs **10** (off by +19)
- Gospel: **33** vs **12** (off by +21)

**Pattern:** Again, “Don’t know” is being counted as “No answer.”  
- **Fix:** Correct the mapping of missing codes.

---

### 3) Percentages
- The Generated Results table shows **counts only** (no percentages).
- The True Results table also shows **counts only** (no percentages).
- **So there are no percentage mismatches to list**—but if your generated analysis was supposed to include percentages, that would be a **missing output column**, not a numeric mismatch.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (Means)
- **All means match** between Generated and True for every genre shown:
  - e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Heavy Metal 4.12, etc.
- This implies your mean calculation likely used only valid responses (1–5) and excluded missing—so the mean is fine even though your missing-category split is wrong.

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories
- **Extra/incorrect column:** `New Age/Space Opera` (combined).
- **Missing column:** `Opera` as its own column (and also `New Age/Space` as its own correctly labeled column).
- **Fix:** Ensure your extraction/export keeps **distinct variables** and does not concatenate adjacent column names into a single header.

---

## How to fix so Generated matches True
1. **Fix the missing-value recode (core issue):**
   - Ensure the survey’s “Don’t know much about it” code is counted under that row.
   - Ensure “No answer” includes only true nonresponse/refusal/blank.
   - Your current output shows a systematic swap/shift:  
     **Generated No answer = True No answer + True Don’t know** (and Generated Don’t know = too small).

2. **Fix the genre columns:**
   - Output **18 separate genre columns**, including **both** `New Age/Space` and `Opera`.
   - Do not merge headers or variables.

3. **Re-run the frequency tabulations** after recoding and confirm for each genre:
   - Counts in (M) Don’t know much about it equal the True table.
   - Counts in (M) No answer equal the True table.
   - (1)–(5) remain unchanged (they already match).

If you tell me what software/code produced the Generated table (R, Stata, SPSS, Python/pandas), I can point to the exact recode/tabulation commands that typically cause this “DK vs NA” inversion and how to correct it.
