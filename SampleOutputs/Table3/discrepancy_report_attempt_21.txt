Score: 55/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing rows in the Generated Results
Your generated table **omits all nonresponse categories** by setting them to zero, but the true table includes them with **nonzero counts**:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**: **missing/nonzero in truth**
- **(M) No answer**: **missing/nonzero in truth**

So the generated table has the right *row labels*, but the **values are wrong (all 0)**, which effectively removes these categories from the distribution.

**Fix:** Populate the two “M” rows with the true counts (listed below), and ensure your code counts these responses rather than dropping them or recoding them to valid scale points.

---

## 2) Column/category mismatches

### A. “Opera” is incorrectly merged into a single column label
In the Generated Results, there is a column labeled:

- **“New Age/Space Opera”** (single combined genre)

In the True Results (Panel 2), these are **two separate genres/columns**:

- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

**Fix:** Split the generated “New Age/Space Opera” into **two separate columns**:
- New Age/Space
- Opera

This likely came from a header-wrapping/concatenation error when transcribing or exporting the table. Ensure the parser reads column headers correctly (especially when a table wraps across lines).

---

## 3) Frequency count mismatches (by cell)

### A. For response categories (1)–(5)
All counts for the substantive responses **(1) to (5)** appear to **match exactly** between Generated and True tables for every genre shown.

So the **only frequency mismatches** are in the “M” rows and the “Opera vs combined column” issue.

---

## 4) Nonresponse (“M”) rows: every incorrect value

### Panel 1 true nonresponse counts (but Generated shows all 0)

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa: **221**
- Jazz: **38**
- Blues/R&B: **56**
- Show Tunes: **77**
- Oldies: **41**
- Classical/Chamber: **66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa: **12**
- Jazz: **15**
- Blues/R&B: **12**
- Show Tunes: **14**
- Oldies: **10**
- Classical/Chamber: **11**

---

### Panel 2 true nonresponse counts (but Generated shows all 0)

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae: **295**
- Swing/Big Band: **164**
- New Age/Space: **292**
- Opera: **83**
- Bluegrass: **163**
- Folk: **78**

**(M) No answer**
- Reggae: **11**
- Swing/Big Band: **12**
- New Age/Space: **14**
- Opera: **13**
- Bluegrass: **11**
- Folk: **12**

**Additional note:** Because Generated merges “New Age/Space Opera,” you cannot correctly assign the true counts for **New Age/Space** vs **Opera** until you split that column.

---

### Panel 3 true nonresponse counts (but Generated shows all 0)

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72**
- Contemporary Rock: **50**
- Rap: **61**
- Heavy Metal: **70**
- Country/Western: **22**
- Gospel: **35**

**(M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13**
- Contemporary Rock: **12**
- Rap: **11**
- Heavy Metal: **10**
- Country/Western: **10**
- Gospel: **12**

## 5) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, percentages)

### A. Means
The **Mean row matches exactly** between Generated and True for every genre.

So there are **no mean mismatches**.

### B. Totals / denominators (implied mismatch)
Even though the means match, the generated frequency table is **internally inconsistent** as a distribution because it claims **0** “Don’t know” and **0** “No answer” everywhere. In the true table those categories are substantial (often hundreds). That means any computed totals, response rates, or percentages derived from the generated table will be wrong.

**Fix:** When computing totals/percentages, use the correct denominator depending on the intended definition:
- If the table is meant to match the **published frequency distribution**, include **all categories (1–5 plus both M categories)**.
- If you want percentages for only substantive attitudes (1–5), you must still report (or explicitly exclude) the M categories and state the denominator change.

### C. Percentages
Neither table shows percentages, but your instruction includes them. If you computed percentages from the generated counts, they will be wrong because the denominator is missing the nonresponse counts.

**Fix:** After correcting the two M rows, recompute percentages using:
- **Total N per genre = sum of (1)–(5) + Don’t know + No answer** (to match the true table’s full distribution).

---

## 6) Why these errors happened (likely) + how to correct in analysis code

### Problem 1: Nonresponse recoded/dropped
**Likely cause:** Your data cleaning filtered out missing/“don’t know” responses (treated as NA) before tabulation.

**Corrective action:**
- Do **not** drop them before the frequency table.
- Explicitly map survey codes to categories:
  - 1–5 = substantive
  - Don’t know = explicit category
  - No answer = explicit category

### Problem 2: Column header concatenation (“New Age/Space Opera”)
**Likely cause:** table header wrapped and got concatenated during extraction.

**Corrective action:**
- Verify the variable list includes **two separate variables** (New Age/Space and Opera).
- In any PDF/HTML extraction, handle multi-line headers and multi-panel tables carefully.

---

## Minimal set of edits required so Generated matches True
1. **Split** “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.
2. Replace the two “M” rows of **all zeros** with the **true nonzero counts** for every genre (as listed above).
3. If producing percentages/totals, **recompute** using totals that include the M categories (unless explicitly reporting valid-only).

If you want, paste your percentage table (or your code), and I’ll point out exactly where the denominator or recode step deviates.
