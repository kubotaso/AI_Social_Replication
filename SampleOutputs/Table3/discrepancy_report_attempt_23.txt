Score: 65/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items / categories (names and number of items)

**Mismatch: “Opera” column name got mangled into the header**
- **Generated header** includes a single combined label: **“New Age/Space Opera”**.
- **True table (Panel 2)** has **two separate columns**: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**.
- However, your generated table *does* show two distinct columns’ worth of numbers in that region (one under “New Age/Space” and one under “Opera”), but the header text is wrong/merged.

**How to fix**
- Split/rename the headers to exactly match the true table:
  - `New Age/Space`
  - `Opera`
- Ensure column count stays at 18 genres total, with these as two separate genre variables.

**Mismatch: Missing the “Don’t know much about it” row (values replaced with zeros)**
- **Generated** row: `(M) Don’t know much about it` is **all 0** for every genre.
- **True** table: this row has **nonzero counts** for every genre.

**How to fix**
- Populate `(M) Don’t know much about it` with the correct counts (listed below in section 2).
- This is likely a coding/recoding issue where that response category was dropped or mapped to missing and then printed as 0.

**Mismatch: “No answer” row exists but values are wrong (they look like the true DK counts)**
- Generated `(M) No answer` counts are large (e.g., Latin/Salsa 233), which is impossible given the true “No answer” values are ~10–15.
- This indicates the generated “No answer” row is actually carrying the **true DK (“Don’t know much about it”) counts**, not the true “No answer” counts.

**How to fix**
- Correct the mapping of missing codes:
  - Map the survey code for **“Don’t know much about it”** to the DK row.
  - Map the survey code for **“No answer”** to the No answer row.
  - Do not collapse these two categories together.

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

#### Rows (1)–(5): Like/Dislike categories
For **every genre**, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly.**  
So the only frequency problems are in the two “M” rows.

---

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — generated is all zeros (should not be)

**True DK counts (must replace the zeros):**

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa–Classical/Chamber)**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae–Folk)**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening–Gospel)**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix**
- In your tabulation, ensure DK is counted as its own category, not treated as missing/excluded.

---

#### (M) No answer — generated values are wrong for every genre

Generated “No answer” equals (or closely tracks) the **true DK** counts instead of the true No answer counts.

Below are the **true “No answer”** counts you should have:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12** (generated 233)
- Jazz **15** (generated 53)
- Blues/R&B **12** (generated 68)
- Show Tunes **14** (generated 91)
- Oldies **10** (generated 51)
- Classical/Chamber **11** (generated 77)

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11** (generated 306)
- Swing/Big Band **12** (generated 176)
- New Age/Space **14** (generated 306)
- Opera **13** (generated 96)
- Bluegrass **11** (generated 174)
- Folk **12** (generated 90)

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13** (generated 85)
- Contemporary Rock **12** (generated 62)
- Rap **11** (generated 72)
- Heavy Metal **10** (generated 80)
- Country/Western **10** (generated 32)
- Gospel **12** (generated 47)

**Fix**
- Correctly assign the survey’s “No answer” code to the “No answer” row.
- Do not substitute DK into No answer (or vice versa).
- If you’re using labeled factors, verify that labels match numeric codes (common failure: swapping code labels).

---

### 3) Percentages
- The generated output shows **counts only**, not percentages.
- The true table also shows **counts only** (plus means).

So: **no percentage mismatches to report** (none provided).

If you intended percentages, you’d need:
- consistent denominators (usually including/excluding DK/NA must match the true table’s convention).

---

### 4) Summary statistics (Means)

**Means match perfectly for every genre.**
- Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Gospel 2.39 all align.

**But there is an internal inconsistency to fix:**  
Your mean computation clearly **excluded DK and No answer** (as it should for a 1–5 attitude mean), but your printed missing-category frequencies are wrong (DK shown as 0; No answer inflated). This will confuse readers because the distribution doesn’t reconcile with the mean logic.

**Fix**
- Keep the mean calculation excluding DK/NA.
- Fix DK/NA counts so the full distribution is coherent.

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories

**Extra/incorrect column label**
- “New Age/Space Opera” should be split into **two columns**:
  - “New Age/Space”
  - “Opera”

**No other missing/extra genres**
- All 18 genres are present in the generated output (despite the header merge).

---

## Root cause diagnosis (why this happened) + concrete fix
This pattern strongly indicates the code that builds the frequency table:
1. **Dropped DK** from the tabulation (treating it as missing), hence zeros.
2. **Mis-assigned DK counts into the “No answer” bucket**, hence huge “No answer.”
3. **Merged two adjacent column labels** for New Age/Space and Opera.

**To fix in analysis code**
- Ensure your value mapping is correct, e.g.:
  - 1–5 = substantive responses
  - a specific code (e.g., 8/9/0 depending on dataset) = DK
  - another code = No answer
- Tabulate with explicit category levels, e.g. set factor levels to include DK and No answer rather than dropping “missing.”
- Build the header from the actual variable names (not concatenated strings), and verify you have two separate variables/columns for New Age/Space and Opera.

If you tell me what software you used (R/Stata/SPSS/Python) and the raw codes for DK/NA, I can give the exact recode/tabulation commands to make the generated table match the true one.
