Score: 63/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: missing and incorrect rows

**True Table 3 has 8 rows per genre:**
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

**Generated table has only 8 numeric rows, but rows 6–7 are wrong:**
- Row 6 in the generated table contains numbers, but it **does not match** the true “Don’t know much about it” counts.
- Row 7 in the generated table is **all zeros**, but the true table has **nonzero “No answer”** counts for every genre.
- The generated output also **omits the row labels entirely**, making it easy to misinterpret which row is which.

**Fix:**  
Output Table 3 with explicit row labels and include both missingness categories as separate rows:
- Add a “(M) Don’t know much about it” row with the correct counts.
- Add a “(M) No answer” row with the correct counts (not zeros).
- Ensure ordering matches the true table.

---

### 2) Column items/categories: columns match, but the content in missingness rows does not

**Columns present:** The generated table includes all 18 genres (Latin/Salsa … Gospel). No extra or missing genre columns.

**However:** because the “Don’t know…” and “No answer” rows are wrong, the *effective* category structure per column does not match the true table.

**Fix:** Keep the same 18 columns, but correct rows 6–7 values.

---

### 3) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

#### A) Rows (1)–(5): appear to match the true table
For all 18 genres, the generated counts for:
- Like very much
- Like it
- Mixed feelings
- Dislike it
- Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly** (spot checks across all three panels show perfect agreement).

No fixes needed for rows 1–5.

---

#### B) Row (M) “Don’t know much about it”: **mismatched for every genre**
The generated table’s 6th numeric row is:

- Latin/Salsa 233 (true **221**)
- Jazz 53 (true **38**)
- Blues/R&B 68 (true **56**)
- Show Tunes 91 (true **77**)
- Oldies 51 (true **41**)
- Classical/Chamber 77 (true **66**)
- Reggae 306 (true **295**)
- Swing/Big Band 176 (true **164**)
- New Age/Space 306 (true **292**)
- Opera 96 (true **83**)
- Bluegrass 174 (true **163**)
- Folk 90 (true **78**)
- Pop/Easy Listening 85 (true **72**)
- Contemporary Rock 62 (true **50**)
- Rap 72 (true **61**)
- Heavy Metal 80 (true **70**)
- Country/Western 32 (true **22**)
- Gospel 47 (true **35**)

So the generated “Don’t know much about it” counts are consistently too high.

**Fix:** Replace the entire “Don’t know much about it” row with the true values:

Latin/Salsa **221**, Jazz **38**, Blues/R&B **56**, Show Tunes **77**, Oldies **41**, Classical/Chamber **66**,  
Reggae **295**, Swing/Big Band **164**, New Age/Space **292**, Opera **83**, Bluegrass **163**, Folk **78**,  
Pop/Easy Listening **72**, Contemporary Rock **50**, Rap **61**, Heavy Metal **70**, Country/Western **22**, Gospel **35**.

---

#### C) Row (M) “No answer”: **missing entirely (shown as all zeros)**
The generated 7th numeric row is all 0.000000, but the true table has:

- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the all-zero row with these “No answer” counts and label it correctly.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (means): match; but they’ll be inconsistent with the incorrect missingness rows

The generated **Mean** row values match the true table (to the displayed precision) for all 18 genres:
- e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.142753 (~3.14), Jazz 2.60528 (~2.61), Rap 3.921773 (~3.92), Heavy Metal 4.122543 (~4.12), etc.

**But:** With the generated (incorrect) missingness counts, the means would generally not reconcile with totals if someone recomputed them (depending on the denominator used). In the true table, the mean is presumably computed on valid attitude responses (1–5), excluding missing categories.

**Fix:** After correcting missingness rows, ensure mean computation rules match the true approach:
- Compute mean using only categories (1)–(5) as valid responses (exclude both M categories).
- Round to two decimals for presentation (as in the true table).

---

### 5) Missing/extra column categories (response options)

**True table includes two missing categories:**
- “(M) Don’t know much about it”
- “(M) No answer”

**Generated table effectively has:**
- A wrong “Don’t know…” row (values don’t match)
- A “No answer” row incorrectly set to zero

**Fix:** Ensure both missing categories are present and correctly populated, not collapsed, not overwritten, and not default-filled with zeros.

## What to change in the generated analysis so it matches the true table

1. **Add row labels** and enforce the 8-row structure exactly as Table 3.
2. **Replace the generated row 6** with the true “Don’t know much about it” counts (listed above).
3. **Replace the generated row 7 (zeros)** with the true “No answer” counts (listed above).
4. **Keep rows 1–5 and means** as they are (they already match).
5. If the table was produced programmatically: ensure missing codes for “don’t know” and “no answer” are not:
   - being reclassified into each other,
   - being mistakenly counted as valid categories,
   - or being dropped and then replaced with zeros during reshaping/pivoting.
