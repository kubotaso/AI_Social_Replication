### 1) Row items/categories: mismatches in labels and counts

**A. Missing/incorrect row labels in the generated table**
- **True table has 8 rows per genre** (7 response categories + Mean):
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
  7. (M) No answer  
  8. Mean
- **Generated table shows 8 numeric rows but no row labels**, so it’s unclear which row corresponds to which attitude category. This is a presentation mismatch (not a numeric mismatch by itself), but it will cause interpretation errors.

**Fix:** Add the exact row labels from the true table in the same order. Ensure the two “M” rows are explicitly labeled as:
- “(M) Don’t know much about it”
- “(M) No answer”

---

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre and category)

All “Like very much” through “Dislike very much” rows match the true table. **All mismatches occur in the two missing-data categories:**
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

Below are **every** count mismatch:

#### A) “(M) Don’t know much about it” row mismatches

| Genre | Generated | True | Difference | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **Jazz** | 42 | 38 | +4 | Change 42 → **38** |
| **Show Tunes** | 80 | 77 | +3 | Change 80 → **77** |
| **Oldies** | 40 | 41 | -1 | Change 40 → **41** |
| **Swing/Big Band** | 165 | 164 | +1 | Change 165 → **164** |
| **New Age/Space** | 295 | 292 | +3 | Change 295 → **292** |
| **Opera** | 85 | 83 | +2 | Change 85 → **83** |
| **Folk** | 79 | 78 | +1 | Change 79 → **78** |
| **Pop/Easy Listening** | 74 | 72 | +2 | Change 74 → **72** |
| **Contemporary Rock** | 51 | 50 | +1 | Change 51 → **50** |
| **Heavy Metal** | 69 | 70 | -1 | Change 69 → **70** |
| **Country/Western** | 21 | 22 | -1 | Change 21 → **22** |
| **Gospel** | 36 | 35 | +1 | Change 36 → **35** |

(Genres not listed above match exactly for this row: Latin/Salsa 221, Blues/R&B 56/57? see note below, Reggae 295, Bluegrass 163, Rap 61, etc.)

**Important note:** In the *true* table, **Blues/R&B “Don’t know much about it” = 56**, while generated shows **57** (it does: generated row has 57 under Blues/R&B). That’s also a mismatch:

- **Blues/R&B:** Generated 57 vs True 56 → **Fix 57 → 56**

So add:

| Genre | Generated | True | Difference | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **Blues/R&B** | 57 | 56 | +1 | Change 57 → **56** |

#### B) “(M) No answer” row mismatches

| Genre | Generated | True | Difference | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **Latin/Salsa** | 11 | 12 | -1 | Change 11 → **12** |
| **Jazz** | 11 | 15 | -4 | Change 11 → **15** |
| **Blues/R&B** | 11 | 12 | -1 | Change 11 → **12** |
| **Show Tunes** | 11 | 14 | -3 | Change 11 → **14** |
| **Oldies** | 11 | 10 | +1 | Change 11 → **10** |
| **Swing/Big Band** | 11 | 12 | -1 | Change 11 → **12** |
| **New Age/Space** | 11 | 14 | -3 | Change 11 → **14** |
| **Opera** | 11 | 13 | -2 | Change 11 → **13** |
| **Folk** | 11 | 12 | -1 | Change 11 → **12** |
| **Pop/Easy Listening** | 11 | 13 | -2 | Change 11 → **13** |
| **Contemporary Rock** | 11 | 12 | -1 | Change 11 → **12** |
| **Heavy Metal** | 11 | 10 | +1 | Change 11 → **10** |
| **Country/Western** | 11 | 10 | +1 | Change 11 → **10** |
| **Gospel** | 11 | 12 | -1 | Change 11 → **12** |

Genres that *do* match for “No answer”: Reggae (11), Bluegrass (11), Rap (11). (But the generated table incorrectly repeats 11 for *all* genres, which is not true.)

**What’s going on:** The generated output appears to have incorrectly **filled the entire “No answer” row with 11s**, which is not what the true table reports.

---

### 3) Percentages: missing (structural mismatch)

- The prompt asks to compare “frequency counts or percentages.”  
- **True table provides counts only (no percentages).**
- **Generated table provides counts only (no percentages).**
So there is **no count-vs-percent mismatch**, but if your generated analysis *claimed* to include percentages, that would be an omission.

**Fix (only if required):** If percentages are desired, compute them using the appropriate denominator. Note: denominators may differ by genre if missingness differs, so be explicit whether you use:
- total responses including missing categories, or
- valid responses excluding the two M categories.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (means): check and mismatches

**Means:** The generated means match the true means (to the precision shown) for all genres:
- Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, Blues/R&B 2.50, Show Tunes 2.59, Oldies 2.25, Classical 2.67,
- Reggae 3.15, Swing 2.45, New Age 3.68, Opera 3.48, Bluegrass 2.67, Folk 2.76,
- Pop 2.41, Contemporary Rock 2.67, Rap 3.92, Heavy Metal 4.12, Country 2.32, Gospel 2.39.

**However:** Because the **missing-category counts are wrong**, any **derived** statistics you compute from totals (e.g., total N per genre, valid N, percent distributions) will be wrong even if the mean row happens to match.

**Fix:** Correct the two missing-category rows first; then recompute any totals/percentages/valid Ns.

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories

**Columns (genres):**
- Generated includes exactly the same 18 genre columns as the true Table 3:
  Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.
- No extra or missing genre columns.

**But:** The true results also include **Table 1 and Table 2 regression outputs**, while the generated results are **only the frequency table-like output**.
- This is a major **content mismatch** if the “generated analysis” was supposed to reproduce *all* true tables.

**Fix:** If the goal is to match the entire “True Results” section, you must generate **three tables** (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3) with the correct structure and coefficients—not just Table 3 frequencies.

---

## What you should change to make the generated table match the true table

1. **Add row labels** matching the true attitude categories (including the two distinct “M” rows).
2. **Replace the “Don’t know much about it” counts** with the true values for each genre (correct the 12 mismatches listed above, including Blues/R&B).
3. **Replace the “No answer” row** (currently all 11s) with the true per-genre counts.
4. After correcting those counts, **recompute** any totals/percentages/valid Ns you report (even though the means already match).
5. If the deliverable is supposed to match the full true output, **also generate Tables 1 and 2** (regression coefficient tables), which are completely absent from the generated results.
