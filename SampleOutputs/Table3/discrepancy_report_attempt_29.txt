Score: 62/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories (names and number of rows)

### Mismatch: missing “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts
- **Generated table includes the two “(M)” rows but sets every cell to 0**:
  - `(M) Don’t know much about it` = 0 for all 18 genres
  - `(M) No answer` = 0 for all 18 genres
- **True table has nonzero values for both rows in every panel/genre.**

**Fix:** Populate those two rows with the true counts (listed below), not zeros.

### Mismatch: column header “New Age/Space Opera” is wrong
- Generated: **“New Age/Space Opera”**
- True: **two separate columns**: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**.

However, the generated output is *not* actually combining them correctly as a single column—it is labeling one column incorrectly while still showing **18 genre columns** (so it’s likely just a naming error rather than a structural merge).

**Fix:** Rename the generated column to match the true structure:
- Replace **“New Age/Space Opera”** with **two distinct columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
And ensure the values align: New Age/Space column should have (48,186,269,429,368,292,14, mean 3.68) and Opera should have (73,257,359,515,306,83,13, mean 3.48).

(If your generated table currently has one column holding the New Age/Space values and another column holding Opera values but mislabeled, then it’s purely a header fix.)

## 2) Frequency counts: every mismatch by genre/category

All counts for response categories (1)–(5) **match perfectly** between generated and true tables for all genres.

**All mismatches occur only in the two missing-data rows**:

### Panel 1: Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber
Replace the generated zeros with:

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

### Panel 2: Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

### Panel 3: Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

## 3) Percentages
- The generated results **do not show percentages at all**, while the prompt asks to compare “frequency counts or percentages.”
- The true table shown provides **counts** and mean, but no percentages either.

**Fix (only if percentages are required):**
1. Compute genre-specific totals including (1)–(5) plus both (M) categories.
2. For each response row, percentage = row count / total for that genre.
3. Add percentage columns or annotate each cell as `count (percent)`—but ensure you’re using the correct denominator (include missing categories if that’s how the true table defines totals).

## 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- The **Mean row matches perfectly** across all genres (including New Age/Space and Opera values).

### Totals / N
- Generated table **does not provide totals**, but it implicitly implies totals because it gives counts.
- With missing-data rows incorrectly set to 0, any totals you compute from the generated table will be **too small** compared to the true totals.

**Fix:** After inserting the correct missing-data counts, recompute any totals/Ns you report.

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Column naming/structure issue: New Age/Space vs Opera
- True structure: separate columns **New Age/Space** and **Opera**
- Generated header suggests a combined/garbled label: **“New Age/Space Opera”**

**Fix options:**
- If there are currently two columns’ worth of data but one mislabeled: **rename headers to “New Age/Space” and “Opera.”**
- If they were truly merged into one column: **split into two columns and allocate the correct counts/means** as per the true table.

---

## What to change in the generated table to match the true table (minimal checklist)

1. **Fill in nonzero counts** for:
   - `(M) Don’t know much about it` (all 18 genres)
   - `(M) No answer` (all 18 genres)
2. **Correct the genre header(s)**:
   - Use **New Age/Space** and **Opera** as separate columns (or at least correct the label(s) so they match the true table).
3. If you compute any **Ns/totals/percentages**, **recompute** them after fixing missing-data counts.
