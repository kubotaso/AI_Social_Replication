============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing rows / wrong number of items)

**Generated table is missing two required response rows for every genre:**
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In your generated output, those two rows appear as **all zeros** across all genres (two rows of `0 0 0 ... 0`). In the true table, those rows have **non-zero counts** for every genre.

**How to fix**
- Add the two missing categories as real rows and populate them with the correct counts from the true table.
- Ensure the generated table has **8 rows per genre**: (1)–(5), (M) Don’t know, (M) No answer, Mean.

### 2) Column/category mismatches (names / missing or extra columns)

**Column set matches the true table (18 genres), but there is a header/name discrepancy:**
- Generated header shows **“New Age/Space Opera”** as if it’s one combined label.
- True table separates this concept as **“New Age/Space”** (Panel 2) and **“Opera”** (its own genre column).

In the generated output, you *do* have a separate **Opera** column (values 73, 257, 359, 515, 306…), so the *data columns* appear correct—but the **header text is wrong/merged**.

**How to fix**
- Rename headers to match true table exactly:
  - Change **“New Age/Space Opera”** → **“New Age/Space”**
  - Keep **“Opera”** as a separate column header.

### 3) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

For categories (1)–(5) and Mean, the generated counts **match** the true table across all genres.

The **only count mismatches** are the two missing “M” rows, where generated shows zeros but true has nonzero values.

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** — generated all 0, true is:
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer** — generated all 0, true is:
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** — generated all 0, true is:
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer** — generated all 0, true is:
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** — generated all 0, true is:
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer** — generated all 0, true is:
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- Replace the two all-zero rows with these true counts in the correct order.

### 4) Percentages and summary-statistic mismatches

**Percentages:**  
- The true table you provided reports **counts only** (plus Mean), not percentages.
- The generated output also shows counts only. So there are **no percentage mismatches**—but if your generated analysis claimed percentages elsewhere, it would be unsupported unless you compute them using the correct denominator (see below).

**Means:**  
- The **Mean row matches perfectly** across all 18 genres.

**Potential downstream issue (important): totals/denominators**
- If the generated analysis computed totals or percentages using only categories (1)–(5), it would be wrong, because the true table includes **(M) Don’t know** and **(M) No answer** that should be included in the total sample size for that item (unless explicitly excluded).
- Example: Latin/Salsa total responses in true table = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**, not 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**.

**How to fix**
- When computing percentages, totals, or valid-response means, state and apply one rule consistently:
  - **All-response %**: divide by (1–5 + don’t know + no answer)
  - **Valid-response %**: divide by (1–5 only), and explicitly note exclusion of missing categories
- Do not leave missing categories as zeros; that silently corrupts totals and any derived statistics.

## Minimal set of corrections needed for the generated table to match the true table
1. **Insert correct counts** for “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” (replace the two zero rows).
2. **Fix the header** from “New Age/Space Opera” to two distinct headers: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** (since Opera is already its own column).
3. If producing percentages/totals elsewhere, **recompute using correct denominators** (including or excluding missing rows explicitly).
