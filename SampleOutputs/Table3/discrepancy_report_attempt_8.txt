Score: 60/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing response categories (rows) in the Generated Results
The **true Table 3** has **8 rows** per genre:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

The **generated table** shows:
- Five numeric rows that correspond to (1)–(5)
- Then **two rows of all zeros**
- Then the Mean row

Those two all-zero rows are **incorrect placeholders** where the generated output should have included:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

**Fix:** Replace the two zero rows with the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” frequencies (see section 2).

### B. Row labels are missing
The generated output has **no row labels** (it’s just numbers). Even if the numbers match, the output is not aligned to the “true” table structure.

**Fix:** Add explicit row labels exactly as in the true table:
- “(1) Like very much”, …, “(5) Dislike very much”, “(M) Don’t know much about it”, “(M) No answer”, “Mean”.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

### Good news: rows (1)–(5) match
For every genre shown, the generated counts for the first 5 attitude categories **match** the true table.

### All mismatches are in the two “M” rows
In the generated results, those rows are all zeros, but the true table has nonzero counts.

Below are **all cells that mismatch** (i.e., every genre for the two missing rows).

#### A. (M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE values (Generated shows 0 for all)
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### B. (M) No answer — TRUE values (Generated shows 0 for all)
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Populate those two rows with the above values instead of zeros.

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: essentially match (rounding only)
Generated mean row:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 vs True 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 vs True 2.61  
- Blues/R&B 2.5 vs True 2.50  
- Show Tunes 2.594059 vs True 2.59  
- Oldies 2.246302 vs True 2.25  
- Classical/Chamber 2.669719 vs True 2.67  
- Reggae 3.154615 vs True 3.15  
- Swing/Big Band 2.447552 vs True 2.45  
- New Age/Space 3.679231 vs True 3.68  
- Opera 3.47947 vs True 3.48  
- Bluegrass 2.665503 vs True 2.67  
- Folk 2.759235 vs True 2.76  
- Pop/Easy Listening 2.406969 vs True 2.41  
- Contemporary Rock 2.670984 vs True 2.67  
- Rap 3.921773 vs True 3.92  
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 vs True 4.12  
- Country/Western 2.324651 vs True 2.32  
- Gospel 2.394484 vs True 2.39  

These differences are just **formatting/rounding precision**, not substantive errors.

**Fix (optional):** Round means to 2 decimals to match the true table formatting.

### Implied totals / N would be wrong if you sum the generated table
Because the generated table uses zeros for “Don’t know” and “No answer,” any computed:
- total responses per genre
- percent distributions
will be **wrong**.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total (with zeros) = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**

**Fix:** After inserting the correct M-row counts, recompute any totals/percentages if you plan to report them.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns: match the true set of 18 genres
The generated table includes exactly these 18 columns (matching Table 3):
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No extra genres and none missing.

**Only formatting issue:** the true results present them in **three separate subtables** of 6 columns each; generated shows all 18 at once. That’s not wrong numerically, just a presentation difference.

---

## How to fix the generated analysis to match the true table (action checklist)

1. **Add the two missing attitude categories as rows**:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it”
   - “(M) No answer”
2. **Fill those rows with the true frequencies** (listed above) instead of zeros.
3. **Add row labels** so the 8 rows are clearly identified.
4. **Round the mean row to two decimals** if you want the same display as the true table.
5. If your generated output includes **percentages**, recompute them using the correct totals (including M categories), otherwise they will not match.

That’s the full set of discrepancies: the only substantive errors are the two missing “M” rows being incorrectly set to zero (and the resulting downstream totals/percentages if computed).
