## 1) Row items/categories mismatched (missing rows)

### Problem
Your **Generated Results** table includes only these 8 rows (implicitly):
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
6. (all zeros)  
7. (all zeros)  
8. Mean  

But the **True Results (Table 3)** have **7 frequency rows + Mean**:

- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**  ← missing in generated
- **(M) No answer**  ← missing in generated
- Mean

In the generated output, the two “(M)” rows exist but are incorrectly shown as **all zeros** (so they are not just unlabeled—they are wrong values).

### Fix
Add the two missing categories as explicit labeled rows and populate them with the correct counts from the true table:
- Row 6 = “(M) Don’t know much about it”
- Row 7 = “(M) No answer”

---

## 2) Frequency counts mismatched (the two “M” rows are wrong for every genre)

### Problem
For **every one of the 18 genres**, your generated table shows:

- Don’t know much about it = 0  
- No answer = 0  

But the true table has nonzero values for all genres.

### Fix (replace the two zero rows with these true counts)

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE values
- Latin/Salsa 221  
- Jazz 38  
- Blues/R&B 56  
- Show Tunes 77  
- Oldies 41  
- Classical/Chamber 66  
- Reggae 295  
- Swing/Big Band 164  
- New Age/Space 292  
- Opera 83  
- Bluegrass 163  
- Folk 78  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72  
- Contemporary Rock 50  
- Rap 61  
- Heavy Metal 70  
- Country/Western 22  
- Gospel 35  

#### (M) No answer — TRUE values
- Latin/Salsa 12  
- Jazz 15  
- Blues/R&B 12  
- Show Tunes 14  
- Oldies 10  
- Classical/Chamber 11  
- Reggae 11  
- Swing/Big Band 12  
- New Age/Space 14  
- Opera 13  
- Bluegrass 11  
- Folk 12  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13  
- Contemporary Rock 12  
- Rap 11  
- Heavy Metal 10  
- Country/Western 10  
- Gospel 12  

Everything else in rows (1)–(5) matches exactly between generated and true.

## 3) Percentages: missing entirely (but implied requirement)

### Problem
The prompt asks to check “frequency counts or **percentages**.” The **true table provides counts (not percents)**, and the generated output also provides counts only. So:
- There are **no percentage mismatches**, because **percentages are not present** in either.
- But if your generated analysis was expected to include percentages, it is missing that column/derivation entirely.

### Fix (if percentages are required)
Compute percentages using the correct denominator. For each genre:

\[
N_{\text{genre}} = \sum_{k=1}^{5} \text{count}_k + \text{DK} + \text{NA}
\]

Then percent per category = count / \(N_{\text{genre}}\) (or exclude DK/NA if that’s the intended convention—but be consistent with the paper).

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means): match, but only because missing rows didn’t affect them

### Check
The **Mean** row in the generated output matches the true table for all genres (to rounding):

- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ 2.61  
- Blues/R&B 2.5 = 2.50  
- Show Tunes 2.594059 ≈ 2.59  
- Oldies 2.246302 ≈ 2.25  
- Classical/Chamber 2.669719 ≈ 2.67  
- Reggae 3.154615 ≈ 3.15  
- Swing/Big Band 2.447552 ≈ 2.45  
- New Age/Space 3.679231 ≈ 3.68  
- Opera 3.47947 ≈ 3.48  
- Bluegrass 2.665503 ≈ 2.67  
- Folk 2.759235 ≈ 2.76  
- Pop/Easy Listening 2.406969 ≈ 2.41  
- Contemporary Rock 2.670984 ≈ 2.67  
- Rap 3.921773 ≈ 3.92  
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ 4.12  
- Country/Western 2.324651 ≈ 2.32  
- Gospel 2.394484 ≈ 2.39  

### Caveat / Fix
Your mean computation likely **ignored** DK/NA (as it should if mean is over 1–5 responses only). That’s fine. But once you fix the DK/NA rows, ensure the mean still:
- uses only categories 1–5, and
- excludes DK/NA from the denominator.

---

## 5) Missing/extra column categories

### Columns (genres)
The generated output includes **all 18 genres** present in the true table, with matching names. No extra/missing genre columns.

### Rows (attitude categories)
As noted, you are missing the **correctly populated** DK and No answer rows (they exist but are wrong/zero and unlabeled).

### Fix
Label the rows explicitly and populate DK/NA with the true values.

---

## Bottom line: every mismatch
1) **Two attitude categories are effectively missing** (DK, No answer) because they are shown as all zeros instead of true counts.  
2) Therefore, **36 cells are wrong**: 18 DK counts + 18 No answer counts.  
3) All (1)–(5) category counts match; all means match (rounded).

If you want, I can rewrite your generated table into the exact structure of Table 3 (with correct DK/NA rows and means) so it matches the true output verbatim.
