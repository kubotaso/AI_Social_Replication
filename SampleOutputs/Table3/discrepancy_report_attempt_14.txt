Score: 73/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing vs. present

### Missing rows in the **Generated Results**
Your generated table includes the 5 substantive attitude categories plus **two rows of all zeros**, then the Mean. In the true table, those two rows are **not zeros**—they are:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

So the generated output is missing both missing-data categories’ *actual counts* for every genre.

**How to fix**
- Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts (listed below in section 2).
- Label them correctly (instead of leaving them unlabeled/implicit).

### Row naming/structure issues
- The true table labels rows as **(1)–(5), (M), (M), Mean**.  
- The generated table has **unlabeled numeric rows**, which makes it ambiguous and easy to misinterpret.

**How to fix**
- Add the “Attitude” row label column and use the same row names as the true table.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre)

### Substantive categories (1)–(5)
For all 18 genres, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
**match the true table exactly.**

So there are **no mismatches** in the (1)–(5) counts.

### Missing-data categories (M): **all mismatched**
In generated results, both missing rows are **0 for every genre**, but the true table has nonzero counts.

#### Correct values that must replace the two zero rows

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)**  
- Don’t know much about it: **221, 38, 56, 77, 41, 66**  
- No answer: **12, 15, 12, 14, 10, 11**

**Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)**  
- Don’t know much about it: **295, 164, 292, 83, 163, 78**  
- No answer: **11, 12, 14, 13, 11, 12**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)**  
- Don’t know much about it: **72, 50, 61, 70, 22, 35**  
- No answer: **13, 12, 11, 10, 10, 12**

**How to fix**
- Populate those two rows with these counts (and label them).

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
All means in the generated table **match** the true table exactly:

- Panel 1 means: 3.14, 2.61, 2.50, 2.59, 2.25, 2.67 (match)
- Panel 2 means: 3.15, 2.45, 3.68, 3.48, 2.67, 2.76 (match)
- Panel 3 means: 2.41, 2.67, 3.92, 4.12, 2.32, 2.39 (match)

### Totals / N
Neither table explicitly shows totals, but your generated table implicitly implies **no missingness** (because it shows zeros for missing categories). That contradicts the true table (which has substantial missingness).

**How to fix**
- If you compute any totals or valid-N, ensure that:
  - **Valid responses** = categories (1)–(5)
  - **Missing** = DK + No answer (kept separate, or combined only if explicitly stated)
- If you report percentages, be explicit whether percentages are of **all cases** or **valid cases only**.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Column/genre set
The generated table includes all **18 genres**, matching the true table. No genres are missing or extra.

### Column name mismatch (minor)
The true table has the header split as **“New Age/Space”** and then a separate column **“Opera”** (Panel 2).  
Your generated header appears as **“New Age/Space Opera”** which can be read as one combined label, even though the numbers underneath clearly behave like two separate columns (New Age/Space and Opera).

**How to fix**
- Ensure the columns are separated and labeled exactly:
  - “New Age/Space”
  - “Opera”
- If you output in plain text, add separators (tabs/commas) or render as a proper table to prevent label concatenation.

---

## Bottom line: what is wrong and how to correct it
1) **Main error:** the two missing-data rows are incorrectly shown as zeros across all genres.  
   - Replace them with the true DK and No answer counts and label them.
2) **Minor but important formatting error:** “New Age/Space” and “Opera” appear concatenated in the header.  
   - Split into two distinct columns with correct labels.
3) **Everything else (counts for 1–5 and means):** matches the true table.
