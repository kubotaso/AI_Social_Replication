Score: 70/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names/number of items)

### A. Missing attitude rows in the Generated Results
The **true table has 8 rows** per genre block:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

The **generated output shows 8 numeric rows**, but rows 6 and 7 are **all zeros**, meaning the generated table is **missing the two “(M)” categories** and incorrectly replaced them with zeros.

**Fix:** Add the two missing rows and populate them with the correct counts (see Section 2). Do **not** use zeros.

### B. Missing row labels
The generated table provides **no row labels** (e.g., “(1) Like very much”, “(M) Don’t know…”, etc.), making it ambiguous and error-prone.

**Fix:** Add the row labels exactly as in the true table, including the “(M)” prefixes.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

### Good news: Rows (1)–(5) match exactly
For every genre shown, the generated counts for:
- Like very much
- Like it
- Mixed feelings
- Dislike it
- Dislike very much

match the true table values.

### All mismatches are in the two missing “(M)” rows

Below are the **true values that must replace the generated zeros**.

#### A) “(M) Don’t know much about it” (should NOT be zeros)
| Genre | True DK count | Generated |
|---|---:|---:|
| Latin/Salsa | 221 | 0 |
| Jazz | 38 | 0 |
| Blues/R&B | 56 | 0 |
| Show Tunes | 77 | 0 |
| Oldies | 41 | 0 |
| Classical/Chamber | 66 | 0 |
| Reggae | 295 | 0 |
| Swing/Big Band | 164 | 0 |
| New Age/Space | 292 | 0 |
| Opera | 83 | 0 |
| Bluegrass | 163 | 0 |
| Folk | 78 | 0 |
| Pop/Easy Listening | 72 | 0 |
| Contemporary Rock | 50 | 0 |
| Rap | 61 | 0 |
| Heavy Metal | 70 | 0 |
| Country/Western | 22 | 0 |
| Gospel | 35 | 0 |

**Fix:** Insert this row and fill with these counts.

#### B) “(M) No answer” (should NOT be zeros)
| Genre | True NA count | Generated |
|---|---:|---:|
| Latin/Salsa | 12 | 0 |
| Jazz | 15 | 0 |
| Blues/R&B | 12 | 0 |
| Show Tunes | 14 | 0 |
| Oldies | 10 | 0 |
| Classical/Chamber | 11 | 0 |
| Reggae | 11 | 0 |
| Swing/Big Band | 12 | 0 |
| New Age/Space | 14 | 0 |
| Opera | 13 | 0 |
| Bluegrass | 11 | 0 |
| Folk | 12 | 0 |
| Pop/Easy Listening | 13 | 0 |
| Contemporary Rock | 12 | 0 |
| Rap | 11 | 0 |
| Heavy Metal | 10 | 0 |
| Country/Western | 10 | 0 |
| Gospel | 12 | 0 |

**Fix:** Insert this row and fill with these counts.

## 3) Summary statistic mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: effectively match (minor formatting/rounding)
Generated mean row:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 vs true 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 vs 2.61  
- Blues/R&B 2.5 vs 2.50  
- … etc.

These differences are **rounding/precision only**, not substantive errors.

**Fix (optional):** Round to two decimals to match presentation in the true table.

### Totals / implied N inconsistency if zeros are kept
In the true table, each genre has additional counts in the two “(M)” categories. By setting them to zero, the generated table implies a smaller N and would break:
- column totals
- any percentage computations
- any downstream analyses that assume full response distribution

**Fix:** Use the correct DK and NA counts so totals align with the true distributions.

---

## 4) Missing/extra column categories

### Columns (genres): match the 18 genres in Table 3
All 18 genre columns are present in the generated output and match the true table’s genre set:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No extra/missing genre columns.

### But: the generated output omits Tables 1–2 entirely
The “True Results” includes regression Tables 1 and 2 in addition to Table 3. The generated output only corresponds to Table 3-style frequencies/means.

**Fix:** If the intent was to reproduce *all* “true results,” you must generate **three tables**, not just the frequency table. If the intent was only Table 3, ignore Tables 1–2.

---

## 5) How to fix the generated analysis to match the true table (exact steps)

1. **Add two attitude categories** (rows) between “Dislike very much” and “Mean”:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it”
   - “(M) No answer”
2. **Populate** those rows with the exact counts listed in Section 2.
3. **Add row labels** for all rows to match the true table structure.
4. **Round means** to two decimals (optional, to match formatting).

Once those changes are made, the generated frequency/mean table will match the true Table 3.
