Score: 78/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing/incorrect rows

### Missing rows in the Generated Results
Your generated table has the 5 substantive response categories, then shows **two rows of all zeros**, then the mean. Those two zero rows are supposed to be the missing-data categories, but they are **not zero in the true table**.

The true table includes **two additional rows** for every genre:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

**Fix:** Replace the two all-zero rows in the generated output with the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts for each genre (listed in section 2).

### Row labels absent/unclear
The generated output provides no explicit row labels for:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much
- (M) Don’t know much about it
- (M) No answer
- Mean

**Fix:** Add these row labels (and ensure the two (M) rows have the correct nonzero counts).

## 2) Frequency counts: every mismatch

### Substantive categories (1)–(5)
All **(1)–(5)** counts in the generated table **match** the true table for all 18 genres.

### Missing-data categories (the mismatches)
For **every genre**, the generated table shows:

- “Don’t know much about it” = **0** (incorrect)
- “No answer” = **0** (incorrect)

Below are the **true counts** you must insert (replacing the two all-zero rows).

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
- **Don’t know much about it:** 221, 38, 56, 77, 41, 66  
- **No answer:** 12, 15, 12, 14, 10, 11

#### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
- **Don’t know much about it:** 295, 164, 292, 83, 163, 78  
- **No answer:** 11, 12, 14, 13, 11, 12

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
- **Don’t know much about it:** 72, 50, 61, 70, 22, 35  
- **No answer:** 13, 12, 11, 10, 10, 12

**Fix:** Populate these two rows with the above values instead of zeros.

## 3) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.): mismatches

### Means
The **Mean** row in the generated results matches the true table for all genres:

- Latin/Salsa 3.14; Jazz 2.61; Blues/R&B 2.50; Show Tunes 2.59; Oldies 2.25; Classical 2.67  
- Reggae 3.15; Swing 2.45; New Age 3.68; Opera 3.48; Bluegrass 2.67; Folk 2.76  
- Pop 2.41; Cont Rock 2.67; Rap 3.92; Heavy Metal 4.12; Country 2.32; Gospel 2.39

So **no mean corrections** are needed.

### Implied totals / denominators (important discrepancy)
Even though means match, your generated frequency table effectively implies the **total N per genre excludes missing data**, because it sets missing rows to 0.

In the true table, totals per genre are **larger** because they include “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer.”

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- Generated total (1–5 only): 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True total (including missing): 1373 + 221 + 12 = **1606**

**Fix:** Ensure any totals/percentages you compute use the correct denominator:
- If reporting full distributions including missing categories: denominator = (1–5) + DK + NA
- If reporting valid-response-only distributions: denominator = (1–5) only, but then you must **explicitly state** missing excluded and still **report** missing counts separately.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Column set
All **18 genre columns** are present in both generated and true outputs. No extra genres appear, and none are missing.

### Column header discrepancy (minor but real)
True table splits “New Age/Space” and “Opera” into **two separate columns** (“New Age/Space” and “Opera”).  
Your generated header text shows **“New Age/Space Opera”**, which can be misread as one combined category, although the numbers clearly follow the two-column structure (New Age/Space then Opera).

**Fix:** Rename the headers to match the true table exactly:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1. **Replace the two all-zero rows** with the correct counts for:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it
   - (M) No answer
2. **Add explicit row labels** for the 7 categories + Mean.
3. **Correct the column headers** to separate “New Age/Space” and “Opera.”
4. If you compute **percentages or totals**, recompute using the proper denominator (either full N including missing, or valid-only with missing reported separately).
