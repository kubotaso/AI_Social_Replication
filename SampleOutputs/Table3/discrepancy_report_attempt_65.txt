Score: 54/100
============================================================

## 1) Wrong table/output type (major mismatch)
- **Generated Results** are a single numeric matrix for 18 genres with **8 rows**, but the **True Results** contain **three regression tables (Tables 1–2)** plus **one frequency table (Table 3)**.
- The generated output corresponds only to **Table 3 (frequency distributions + mean)**, and **omits Tables 1 and 2 entirely**.

**Fix:** If the task is to reproduce the “true results,” you must output:
1) Table 1 (regression coefficients + constants + R² + N)  
2) Table 2 (regression coefficients + constants + R² + N)  
3) Table 3 (frequency distributions with attitude labels + mean)

If the task is only Table 3, then remove Tables 1–2 from the “true results” comparison and ensure Table 3 matches exactly (see below).

---

## 2) Row category mismatches (Table 3)
### A) Missing/incorrect “missing-data” categories
**True Table 3** has **7 attitude rows + Mean**:
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
7. **(M) No answer**  
8. Mean

**Generated Results** instead show:
- Five preference rows (correct counts for many genres)
- A 6th numeric row that appears intended as “Don’t know much about it” **but is wrong for many genres**
- A 7th row that is **all “30” for every genre** (this does not correspond to any true category)
- Mean row

**Fix:**
- Replace the generated “all 30s” row with the correct **(M) No answer** counts **for each genre**.
- Correct the “Don’t know much about it” row values (see Section 3).
- Add explicit row labels exactly as in the true table: “(M) Don’t know much about it” and “(M) No answer”.

### B) Missing row labels
The generated table has **no row labels** at all, so it’s impossible to tell which row is which.

**Fix:** Add the row labels shown in the true table.

---

## 3) Frequency/count mismatches (Table 3)

The first 5 attitude rows in the generated output **match the true table** for all genres shown. The mismatches are in the two missing-data rows: **“Don’t know much about it”** and **“No answer.”**

Below are **every incorrect value** in the generated “Don’t know much about it” row, plus the fact that the “No answer” row is completely wrong (all 30s).

- **Fix:** change to **22**

#### Gospel
- **Generated:** 17  
- **True:** 35  
- **Fix:** change to **35**

### B) “(M) No answer” row — entirely wrong
- **Generated:** 30 for *every* genre  
- **True (varies by genre):**
  - Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11
  - Reggae 11; Swing 12; New Age 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12
  - Pop 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country 10; Gospel 12

**Fix:** Replace the entire row with the true “No answer” values above.

---

## 4) Column/category mismatches
### A) Missing column grouping headers
**True Table 3** is presented in **three separate subtables** (6 genres each).  
**Generated** combines all 18 genres into one wide table.

**Fix (optional formatting but “true match” requires it):**
- Split into the same three panels:
  1) Latin/Salsa … Classical/Chamber  
  2) Reggae … Folk  
  3) Pop/Easy Listening … Gospel

### B) Percentages are missing
Your prompt asks to compare “frequency counts or percentages.” The **true table provides counts only** (no percentages). The generated output also provides counts only.

**Fix:** None required unless you intend to add percentages—then you must add them to *both* and compute them from the same denominator (and clarify whether missing responses are included).

---

## 5) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)
### Means
The **Mean row matches** the true table for all genres to the displayed precision (minor rounding differences only, e.g., 3.142753 vs 3.14). No substantive mismatch.

**Fix (presentation):** round means to **two decimals** to match the true table.

### Totals / N checks (not shown but implied)
Because the generated “Don’t know” and “No answer” rows are wrong, the **total responses per genre** implied by the generated table will not match the true totals.

**Fix:** After correcting the two missing-data rows, re-check that for each genre:  
Like very much + Like it + Mixed feelings + Dislike it + Dislike very much + Don’t know + No answer  
matches the true table’s implied total for that genre.

---

## 6) How to correct the generated table so it matches the true Table 3
1) Add the correct **row labels**.
2) Replace the generated “Don’t know much about it” row with the true counts (all 18 fixes listed above).
3) Replace the “all 30s” row with the true **No answer** counts (genre-specific).
4) Round the mean values to **two decimals**.
5) (If required) format into the same **three 6-column panels** as the true table.
6) If you are also expected to match the full “True Results” block, **add Tables 1 and 2** (regression coefficients, constants, R², adjusted R², N) because they are completely missing from the generated output.

If you want, I can rewrite your generated table into the exact true Table 3 layout (three panels) with all corrected rows.
