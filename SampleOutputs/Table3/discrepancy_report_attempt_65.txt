Score: 63/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/incorrect rows)

**A. “(M) Don’t know much about it” row is wrong for every genre**
- **Generated:** all zeros across all 18 genres.
- **True:** nonzero “Don’t know much about it” counts for every genre (values differ by genre).

**Fix:** Replace the entire “(M) Don’t know much about it” row in the generated table with the true counts (listed in section 2 below).

**B. “(M) No answer” row is wrong for every genre**
- **Generated:** very large values (e.g., Latin/Salsa 233; Reggae 176; Pop 85; etc.).
- **True:** very small values (mostly 10–15 per genre).

**Fix:** Replace the entire “(M) No answer” row with the true counts (listed below). Those big generated “No answer” values are almost certainly the true “Don’t know much about it” counts (or some other missing category) that were mis-assigned.

**C. Category names/structure mismatch for Opera**
- **Generated column header:** `New Age/Space Opera` (combined into one column label).
- **True table:** **two distinct items**:
  - `New Age/Space`
  - `Opera`

**Fix:** Split the generated `New Age/Space Opera` into **two separate columns** and label them exactly as in the true table:
- `New Age/Space`
- `Opera`
The counts you show under that combined header appear to correspond to **New Age/Space** only (48, 186, 269, 429, 368, mean 3.68). Opera is missing as its own column.

### 2) Frequency-count mismatches (by row/category)

For the five substantive attitude categories **(1)–(5)**, your generated counts match the true table **for all genres** (once Opera/New Age are treated as separate columns). The mismatches are entirely in the two “M” rows.

Below are the **true values** you must use.

#### True “(M) Don’t know much about it” counts (replace the generated zeros)
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### True “(M) No answer” counts (replace the generated large numbers)
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

### 3) Summary statistic mismatches (Mean and any implied totals)

**Means**
- The **Mean row in the generated table matches the true table** for every listed genre (again, with the caveat that Opera is missing as its own column).
- Because your “Don’t know” and “No answer” rows are wrong, this indicates your mean was computed correctly **excluding missing categories** (as is typical), or it was copied from the true table independently.

**Fix (procedural):**
- Ensure the mean is computed on **valid responses only (1–5)** and excludes both missing categories:
  - Don’t know much about it
  - No answer
- After you correct the missing rows, re-check that your mean calculation still matches the true means (it should).

**Totals / N (if you report them elsewhere)**
- Even though not shown, your generated table currently implies incorrect totals because:
  - You have **0** in “Don’t know” and huge “No answer,” which will distort any “Total N” per genre if calculated from the table.
- In the true data, totals per genre should be the sum of (1)–(5) + Don’t know + No answer.

**Fix:** After correcting both M-rows, recompute any totals and percentages.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

**Missing column:** `Opera` (as a separate genre).
- **Generated:** Opera is not present as its own column; it is incorrectly merged into the New Age header text.
- **True:** Opera is a distinct genre with its own distribution and mean (mean **3.48**).

**Fix:** Add an `Opera` column with the true values:
- Like very much 73
- Like it 257
- Mixed feelings 359
- Dislike it 515
- Dislike very much 306
- Don’t know 83
- No answer 13
- Mean 3.48

### What to change in the generated output to match the true table (checklist)

1. **Rename/split columns**
   - Change `New Age/Space Opera` → two columns: `New Age/Space` and `Opera`.

2. **Correct the missing-category rows**
   - Replace the all-zero **Don’t know** row with the true counts (18 values).
   - Replace the inflated **No answer** row with the true small counts (18 values).

3. **Recompute any percentages/totals (if produced)**
   - Use corrected totals per genre.
   - Means should remain based on valid (1–5) responses only.

If you want, paste any generated “percent” table or totals you computed from these counts; those will also have systematic mismatches due to the swapped/zeroed missing categories.
