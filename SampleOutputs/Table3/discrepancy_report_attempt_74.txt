Score: 55/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/incorrect rows)

**A. “(M) Don’t know much about it” row is wrong in the Generated Results**
- **Generated:** all zeros for every genre.
- **True:** nonzero counts for every genre (varies by genre).

**Fix:** Replace the entire “Don’t know much about it” row with the true counts (listed in section 3 below). Zeros are incorrect across the board.

**B. “(M) No answer” row is wrong in the Generated Results**
- **Generated:** large counts (e.g., Latin/Salsa = 233) that do not match the true table.
- **True:** “No answer” is small (mostly ~10–15 per genre).

**Fix:** Replace the entire “No answer” row with the true counts (listed in section 3).

**C. Column/category labeling discrepancy: “New Age/Space Opera”**
- **Generated column label:** `New Age/Space Opera` (combined).
- **True table:** splits across two columns/words as **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** in Panel 2 (i.e., “New Age/Space” is one genre and “Opera” is another genre).

However: the **generated table actually contains two separate columns**: one labeled `New Age/Space` and another labeled `Opera` (they just appear adjacent and the header line reads oddly as “New Age/Space Opera”).

**Fix:** Clean the header so these are clearly **two distinct columns**:
- `New Age/Space`
- `Opera`

(So this is primarily a **formatting/labeling** issue, not a numeric one.)

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

For response categories **(1)–(5)** and the **Mean**, the generated counts match the true table (no mismatches found).

All mismatches occur in the two “missing-data” categories:

#### A) “(M) Don’t know much about it” — mismatched for **all 18 genres**
Generated is `0` for all; true is nonzero for all.

#### B) “(M) No answer” — mismatched for **all 18 genres**
Generated values are much larger and incorrect; true values are small.

---

### 3) Exact corrections needed (replace the two incorrect rows)

#### Correct “(M) Don’t know much about it” counts (True)
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### Correct “(M) No answer” counts (True)
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix (implementation):** In the generated table, overwrite:
- the entire `(M) Don’t know much about it` row with the 18 true values above
- the entire `(M) No answer` row with the 18 true values above

---

### 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** The generated **Mean** row matches the true table for all genres (no mismatches).

**Percentages:** Neither table shows percentages, so there are no percentage mismatches to report. If your “generated analysis” was supposed to include percentages, that’s a *missing output element* (but not a mismatch against the provided true table).

---

### 5) Missing/extra column categories

- Both have the same **18 genres**. No genre is missing or extra.
- The only column issue is the **header formatting** around **New Age/Space** and **Opera** (needs clearer separation).

---

## Bottom line
To make the generated analysis match the true table:
1) **Replace the “Don’t know much about it” row (currently all zeros) with the true nonzero counts.**  
2) **Replace the “No answer” row (currently inflated/incorrect) with the true small counts.**  
3) **Fix the header labeling** so “New Age/Space” and “Opera” appear as separate columns (not visually merged).
