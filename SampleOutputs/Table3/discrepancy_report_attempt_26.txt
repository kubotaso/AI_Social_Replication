Score: 63/100
============================================================

## 1) Wrong table entirely (major row/category mismatch)
**Generated Results** is a numeric matrix that looks like it’s attempting to reproduce **Table 3 (frequency distributions + mean)** for 18 genres.

But your **True Results** also include **Table 1 and Table 2 (regression coefficients)**. The generated output contains **none** of the variables/columns from Tables 1–2 (Education, R², etc.), so it **does not match** those tables at all.

**Fix:** If you intended to reproduce all “true results,” you must output **three separate tables**:
- Table 1: regression coefficients + constants + R² + N
- Table 2: regression coefficients + constants + R² + N
- Table 3: frequency distributions + means for 18 genres  
Right now, the generated output corresponds only to Table 3 (and even that has errors—see below).

---

## 2) Table 3: Row labels are missing and two rows are wrong (DK/NA)
### A. Missing/incorrect row items (names)
In the **True Table 3**, rows are labeled:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

In the **Generated Results**, you have **8 rows of numbers** but **no row labels**, and (critically) the **6th and 7th rows do not match DK/NA**.

**Fix:** Add the row labels and ensure row 6 = “Don’t know much about it” and row 7 = “No answer” with correct counts.

---

## 3) Table 3: Frequency mismatches (by genre)
Rows 1–5 match perfectly across all genres (Like very much → Dislike very much).  
The mismatches are entirely in the “Don’t know much about it” row and the “No answer” row.

### A. “Don’t know much about it” row (Generated row 6) — mismatches
Below are **True vs Generated** for DK (“Don’t know much about it”):

- **Latin/Salsa:** True **221**, Generated **201** (−20)
- **Jazz:** True **38**, Generated **21** (−17)
- **Blues/R&B:** True **56**, Generated **36** (−20)
- **Show Tunes:** True **77**, Generated **59** (−18)
- **Oldies:** True **41**, Generated **19** (−22)
- **Classical/Chamber:** True **66**, Generated **45** (−21)

- **Reggae:** True **295**, Generated **274** (−21)
- **Swing/Big Band:** True **164**, Generated **144** (−20)
- **New Age/Space:** True **292**, Generated **274** (−18)
- **Opera:** True **83**, Generated **64** (−19)
- **Bluegrass:** True **163**, Generated **142** (−21)
- **Folk:** True **78**, Generated **58** (−20)

- **Pop/Easy Listening:** True **72**, Generated **53** (−19)
- **Contemporary Rock:** True **50**, Generated **30** (−20)
- **Rap:** True **61**, Generated **40** (−21)
- **Heavy Metal:** True **70**, Generated **48** (−22)
- **Country/Western:** True **22**, Generated **0** (−22)
- **Gospel:** True **35**, Generated **15** (−20)

**Pattern:** Generated DK counts are systematically too low (often by ~18–22), and **Country/Western DK is catastrophically wrong (0 instead of 22)**.

**Fix:** Replace the entire DK row with the true DK counts from Table 3.

---

### B. “No answer” row (Generated row 7) — mismatches
True “No answer” varies by genre (10–15).  
Generated row 7 is **32 for every genre**, which is wrong for all 18 genres.

True “No answer” (for reference):
- Latin/Salsa **12**, Jazz **15**, Blues/R&B **12**, Show Tunes **14**, Oldies **10**, Classical **11**
- Reggae **11**, Swing **12**, New Age **14**, Opera **13**, Bluegrass **11**, Folk **12**
- Pop **13**, Contemporary Rock **12**, Rap **11**, Heavy Metal **10**, Country **10**, Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the “No answer” row with these true counts (do not use a constant).

---

## 4) Column categories: none missing/extra for Table 3, but formatting is off
### A. Columns (genres)
All **18 genres** are present in the generated output and match the True Table 3 genre set:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

So **no missing/extra genre columns**.

### B. But Table 3 is supposed to be split into three subtables
True results present Table 3 as **three 6-column panels**. Your generated output prints them all in one block (that’s not “wrong” numerically, but it **does not match the true table structure**).

**Fix:** Either:
- present as three panels like the true table, or
- keep one wide table but clearly label it as a combined version of Table 3.

---

## 5) Summary statistics (Mean row) — matches
The generated **Mean** row matches the true means (minor rounding differences only):
- e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ 3.14, Jazz 2.60528 ≈ 2.61, etc.

So **no mean mismatches** to fix.

---

## 6) Why the DK/NA errors likely happened + how to correct your pipeline
### Likely cause
Your generation appears to have:
- computed rows 1–5 correctly from the frequency distribution,
- then **miscomputed missing categories** by either:
  - treating “Don’t know much about it” as something else (e.g., a partial subset), and/or
  - inserting a constant placeholder **32** for “No answer,” instead of reading actual values.

### Concrete fix
1. Ensure the code/tabulation explicitly includes **all response levels**:
   - 1,2,3,4,5, “Don’t know much,” “No answer”
2. Do not collapse missing categories unless the true table collapses them (it does not).
3. Validate per-genre totals:  
   For each genre, verify:  
   **sum(rows 1–5 + DK + NA) = total N for that genre** (should be consistent across genres if same respondents answered; if not, at least DK/NA must match the published table).
4. Hard requirement: set **Country/Western DK = 22**, not 0, and set NA to the genre-specific values above.

---

### Bottom line corrections needed
- Add missing row labels.
- Replace **DK (“Don’t know much about it”) row** with the true DK counts (18 fixes).
- Replace **No answer row** (currently all 32s) with the true per-genre NA counts (18 fixes).
- If you intended to reproduce the full “True Results,” also generate Tables 1 and 2 (currently completely missing).
