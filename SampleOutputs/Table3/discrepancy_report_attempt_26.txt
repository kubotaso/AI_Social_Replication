Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories (names and number of rows)

### Mismatch: Missing response rows in the Generated Results
The **True Results** have **7 response rows** + Mean:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
7. **(M) No answer**  
8. Mean

The **Generated Results** include rows (6) and (7) but set them to **0 for every genre**, which is incorrect. So functionally the generated table is missing the *actual* “Don’t know” and “No answer” distributions.

**Fix:** Populate the last two rows with the correct counts (see Section 2). Do not force them to zero; treat them as legitimate categories.

---

### Mismatch: Column header/category naming issue (“New Age/Space Opera”)
- **Generated column:** “New Age/Space Opera”
- **True columns:** “New Age/Space” and **separate** column “Opera”

The generated output appears to have **merged two distinct genres (New Age/Space and Opera)** into one mislabeled genre.

**Fix:** Split the generated “New Age/Space Opera” into **two separate columns**:
- “New Age/Space”
- “Opera”

and then fill each with its own correct frequencies/means (as in the True Results Panel 2).

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (including missing categories)

### A) Panel 1 genres: Don’t know / No answer are wrong (set to zero)
For **Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber**, the generated table has:

- (M) Don’t know much about it = 0 (all wrong)
- (M) No answer = 0 (all wrong)

Correct values from the True Results:

| Genre | Don’t know | No answer |
|---|---:|---:|
| Latin/Salsa | 221 | 12 |
| Jazz | 38 | 15 |
| Blues/R&B | 56 | 12 |
| Show Tunes | 77 | 14 |
| Oldies | 41 | 10 |
| Classical/Chamber | 66 | 11 |

**Fix:** Replace zeros with these counts.

---

### B) Panel 2 genres: Don’t know / No answer are wrong (set to zero)
For **Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk**, generated again sets missing rows to 0 (wrong).

Correct values:

| Genre | Don’t know | No answer |
|---|---:|---:|
| Reggae | 295 | 11 |
| Swing/Big Band | 164 | 12 |
| New Age/Space | 292 | 14 |
| Opera | 83 | 13 |
| Bluegrass | 163 | 11 |
| Folk | 78 | 12 |

**Fix:** Replace zeros with these counts and ensure New Age/Space and Opera are separate columns (see naming issue above).

---

### C) Panel 3 genres: Don’t know / No answer are wrong (set to zero)
For **Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel**, generated sets both missing rows to 0 (wrong).

Correct values:

| Genre | Don’t know | No answer |
|---|---:|---:|
| Pop/Easy Listening | 72 | 13 |
| Contemporary Rock | 50 | 12 |
| Rap | 61 | 11 |
| Heavy Metal | 70 | 10 |
| Country/Western | 22 | 10 |
| Gospel | 35 | 12 |

**Fix:** Replace zeros with these counts.

---

### D) All other listed frequency rows (1)–(5): mostly match
For response categories **(1)–(5)**, the generated counts match the true table **for all genres shown**, *except* for the structural issue that “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are incorrectly combined into one header. The numbers shown under that combined header in the generated table correspond to **New Age/Space** (48, 186, 269, 429, 368), while **Opera’s** numbers (73, 257, 359, 515, 306) appear in a separate column labeled “Bluegrass” area in the generated header line only because the header is malformed/concatenated—i.e., the columns are not clearly represented.

**Fix:** Reconstruct the header so the columns align exactly with the True Results list and then place Opera counts under Opera.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (Mean)

### Means: appear correct for the listed genres, but inconsistent with missing-data rows being zero
The **Mean row values shown** in the generated table match the **True Results means** for each genre.

However, the generated table simultaneously claims **Don’t know** and **No answer** counts are zero. That is inconsistent with the real data structure: the mean should be computed on the valid 1–5 responses, excluding missing categories—so you can’t have the correct mean if you’ve incorrectly set missing counts to zero *while still using the true mean*. This indicates the generated output mixed true means with fabricated “missing=0” rows.

**Fix:** Keep the means as shown (they match true), but ensure the missing rows are correctly populated. Also document/compute means consistently: typically:
- mean computed on 1–5 only
- exclude “Don’t know” and “No answer” from mean denominator

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column: Opera (as its own genre)
Opera is a distinct genre in the True Results (Panel 2). The generated output does not present “Opera” as a standalone column; it is fused into “New Age/Space Opera.”

**Fix:** Add an explicit “Opera” column and remove “Opera” from the “New Age/Space” label.

### Extra/incorrect column label: “New Age/Space Opera”
This label does not exist in the True Results.

**Fix:** Rename and split as above.

---

## 5) How to correct the generated table so it matches the True table

1. **Rebuild the column list to exactly these 18 genres (in order):**  
   Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber,  
   Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk,  
   Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel

2. **Fill in the two missing-response rows using the True Results counts** for every genre (all the “Don’t know…” and “No answer” values listed above).

3. **Verify totals per genre** (optional but recommended): each genre total should equal the sum of the 7 frequency rows. In the generated version, totals are currently understated because two rows are incorrectly zeroed out.

4. **Keep the Mean row** as-is (it matches), but ensure your computation excludes missing categories (or clearly state the rule used).

If you want, I can rewrite the full corrected “Generated Results” table in the same format as your generated output, with the proper Opera split and the correct missing-category counts inserted.
