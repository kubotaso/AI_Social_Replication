Score: 70/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/extra rows)

### Missing rows in the **Generated Results**
Your generated frequency table includes only these rows (implicitly):
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- then **two additional rows of all zeros**
- Mean

But the **True Results (Table 3)** require **two non-substantive response categories** for *every* genre:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In your generated output, those two rows exist structurally (two rows between “Dislike very much” and “Mean”), but they are incorrectly filled with **0.000000 for every genre**. Those should be the actual counts shown in the true table.

**How to fix**
- Add/populate the two missing frequency rows using the real counts from Table 3.
- Do not leave them as zeros.
- Ensure row labels match exactly (including the “(M)”).

There are **no extra attitude categories** in the true table beyond those 7 rows + Mean, so the only “extra” issue is that your two rows are present but wrongly zeroed (effectively “missing data categories”).

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre)

All “Like…/Dislike…” counts (rows 1–5) in the generated table **match** the true table for all 18 genres.

The **only frequency mismatches** are for the two missing-data rows:

### A) “(M) Don’t know much about it” — generated = 0 for all, true ≠ 0
You need to replace the all-zero row with the following true counts:

- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

### B) “(M) No answer” — generated = 0 for all, true ≠ 0
Replace the second all-zero row with the following true counts:

- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

### Percentages
Your generated output shows **counts only**, not percentages. The prompt asks to compare “counts or percentages”; since the generated table has no percentages column/values, it is **missing percentages entirely** (if percentages were expected). The true table also shows counts (not percentages), so **this is only a mismatch if your generated spec was supposed to include %**.

**How to fix (if % are required)**
- Add percentage columns (or a second table) computed as:  
  \[
  \% = \frac{\text{category count}}{\text{total (including M categories if that’s the rule)}} \times 100
  \]
- Be explicit whether the denominator includes “Don’t know” and “No answer.”

## 3) Summary statistic mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The generated means row:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 (≈ **3.14**)  
- Jazz 2.60528 (≈ **2.61**)  
- Blues/R&B 2.5 (**2.50**)  
- Show Tunes 2.594059 (≈ **2.59**)  
- Oldies 2.246302 (≈ **2.25**)  
- Classical/Chamber 2.669719 (≈ **2.67**)  
… and similarly for all other genres

These **match the true table means** to rounding precision. No correction needed.

### Implied totals / N (not printed but affected)
Even though totals are not shown, setting missing-data counts to zero implicitly changes the total number of responses per genre (and any derived statistics like valid %). In the true table, each genre has nonzero DK/NA, so your generated table implies **incorrect sample sizes** if someone sums rows.

**How to fix**
- Populate DK and NA counts correctly (above).
- Optionally add a “Total” row per genre:
  - Total = sum of the 7 frequency rows (1–5 + DK + NA)

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns (genre names)
All 18 genre columns appear in the generated output and match the true set:

Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber; Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk; Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel.

No genre columns are missing or extra.

### Structural difference vs. True Table presentation
The true output is split into three subtables of 6 genres each; your generated output puts all 18 in one wide table. That’s a formatting difference, not a content mismatch.

## 5) What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1) **Replace the two all-zero rows** with the correct counts for:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it”
   - “(M) No answer”

2) **Add row labels** explicitly (your generated output currently lacks the attitude labels, showing only numeric rows). To match the true table, label each row as:
   - (1) Like very much
   - (2) Like it
   - (3) Mixed feelings
   - (4) Dislike it
   - (5) Dislike very much
   - (M) Don’t know much about it
   - (M) No answer
   - Mean

3) If your deliverable requires **percentages**, add them; otherwise counts-only is consistent with Table 3.

That’s it: the substantive “Like/Dislike” frequencies and means are already correct; the only true numerical discrepancies are the two missing-data rows being incorrectly zeroed.
