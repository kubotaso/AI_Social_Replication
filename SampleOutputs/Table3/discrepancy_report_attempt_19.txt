Score: 60/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing rows in the Generated Results
Your generated table includes these rows:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- (M) Don’t know much about it  
- (M) No answer  
- Mean

But in the generated output, the two “M” rows are **present as labels but all entries are incorrectly set to 0**. In the true table, those rows have **nonzero** counts for every genre.

**Fix:** Populate the two missingness rows with the correct counts (see Section 2).

### B. Column/category structure mismatch: “New Age/Space Opera” vs two separate columns
In the **true** table (Panel 2), there are **two distinct genres/columns**:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

In your **generated** table, these appear to be **merged into one column header**:
- **“New Age/Space Opera”**

Yet the body of the table still contains **two different columns of numbers** (e.g., “New Age/Space Opera” then a separate “Bluegrass”), which indicates the header is malformed/concatenated and not aligned with the true structure.

**Fix:** Split that combined header into **two columns**:
- “New Age/Space”
- “Opera”

and ensure each column receives the correct counts (already present in your body for the first five response rows, but missing for the M rows).

### C. Number of items/genres
The true table is 18 genres:
1. Latin/Salsa
2. Jazz
3. Blues/R&B
4. Show Tunes
5. Oldies
6. Classical/Chamber
7. Reggae
8. Swing/Big Band
9. New Age/Space
10. Opera
11. Bluegrass
12. Folk
13. Pop/Easy Listening
14. Contemporary Rock
15. Rap
16. Heavy Metal
17. Country/Western
18. Gospel

Your generated table *looks like* it intends 18, but because of the header merge (“New Age/Space Opera”), the genre list is **not correctly represented**.

**Fix:** Correct the header so all 18 genres appear as distinct columns.

## 2) Frequency-count mismatches (by row)

### Rows (1)–(5): Like/Dislike categories
For the first five attitude categories, your generated counts **match the true table** for all genres shown. I do not see mismatches there.

### Row: (M) Don’t know much about it
Generated table has **0 for every genre**. True table has nonzero counts:

**Panel 1 (true values):**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 (true values):**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 (true values):**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix:** Replace the generated zeros with these true counts, and ensure they align under the correct genre columns (especially New Age/Space vs Opera).

### Row: (M) No answer
Generated table has **0 for every genre**. True table has nonzero counts:

**Panel 1 (true values):**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2 (true values):**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3 (true values):**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the generated zeros with these true counts.

### Percentages
Neither table displays percentages, only counts and means. So there are no percentage mismatches to check—but if your generated analysis *claims* percentages elsewhere, you must compute them using the correct denominators (see note under “How to fix” below).

---

## 3) Summary statistic mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The **Mean** row in the generated results matches the true table for all genres (e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, …, Gospel 2.39). No mean mismatches detected.

### Implied totals / N (important hidden mismatch)
Even though means match, the generated table’s **zeros for missing categories imply a different total N per genre** than the true table.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total N = 85+325+416+403+144 +221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total N (with missing rows = 0) = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**

So any totals, Ns, or percentage distributions computed from the generated table would be wrong.

**Fix:** Add the missing-category counts so totals per genre match the true totals.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column: none, but mis-labeled/merged column
You do not appear to have an extra genre, but you have a **header error** combining:
- New Age/Space
- Opera

into “New Age/Space Opera”.

**Fix:** Correct the column headers and ensure the data columns are correctly labeled:
- New Age/Space
- Opera

---

## 5) What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1. **Correct the column header structure**
   - Replace “New Age/Space Opera” with two columns: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.
   - Verify all subsequent columns shift into the correct positions (to prevent misalignment).

2. **Fill in the two missingness rows with true counts**
   - Replace all zeros in:
     - “(M) Don’t know much about it”
     - “(M) No answer”
   - Use the exact values listed above.

3. **Recompute any derived outputs**
   - If you produce percentages:  
     - Decide whether percentages should be out of **all responses including M categories** (typical for a full distribution) or only valid 1–5 responses.
     - Use the correct denominator accordingly (which requires the nonzero M counts).

4. **(Optional check) Validate column alignment after fixing headers**
   - Because the header merge suggests parsing/alignment issues, verify that counts for “New Age/Space” and “Opera” remain:
     - Like very much: 48 (New Age/Space), 73 (Opera)
     - Like it: 186, 257
     - Mixed: 269, 359
     - Dislike: 429, 515
     - Dislike very much: 368, 306
     - Don’t know: 292, 83
     - No answer: 14, 13

Those changes fully reconcile the generated output with the true frequency table.
