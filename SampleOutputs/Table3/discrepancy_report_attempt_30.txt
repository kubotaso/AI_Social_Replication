Score: 72/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing attitude rows in the Generated Results
In the generated table, both of these rows are present but incorrectly filled with zeros across all genres:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the **true** tables, these rows have **nonzero** counts for *every* genre.

**How to fix**
- Populate these two rows with the correct frequencies from the true table (listed below in §2).
- Do **not** set them to 0 unless you have explicitly filtered them out; if you filtered them out, then you must also:
  - remove those rows entirely, and
  - recompute means using only valid 1–5 responses (and report that explicitly).  
  Currently, the generated output *includes the rows* but with *wrong values (zeros)*, which is internally inconsistent.

### B. Column/category mismatch: “New Age/Space Opera” is wrong
The generated header includes **“New Age/Space Opera”** as a single genre label.

In the true table (Panel 2), the genres are:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

They are **two separate columns**, not one combined column.

**How to fix**
- Split the generated “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**:
  - “New Age/Space”
  - “Opera”
- Ensure each gets its own frequency distribution, missing categories, and mean.

### C. Number of genre columns differs
- **True table:** 18 genres total.
- **Generated table:** effectively **17** genres because it merges **New Age/Space** and **Opera** into one column.

**How to fix**
- Add the missing **Opera** column (and rename New Age/Space correctly), restoring **18** genre columns.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

All “Like…” through “Dislike very much” counts match the true table **for the genres that exist as separate columns**. The errors are concentrated in:
1) the two missing-data rows (set to zero), and  
2) the missing/split column issue around New Age/Space vs Opera.

### A. (M) Don’t know much about it — generated shows 0; true is nonzero

Replace the generated zeros with these **true counts**:

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Critical note about your merged column**
- Because you merged “New Age/Space” and “Opera” into **one** column, there is *no single true value* for “Don’t know much about it” for that merged category. You must split the column to match the true table.

---

### B. (M) No answer — generated shows 0; true is nonzero

Replace the generated zeros with these **true counts**:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

Again, for the merged “New Age/Space Opera” column: you can’t correctly fill this without splitting into separate “New Age/Space” and “Opera” columns.

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### A. Means
The **mean values shown in the generated output match the true table** *for all correctly defined genres*, including New Age/Space and Opera **values**:

Generated mean row includes (among others):
- New Age/Space: **3.68** (matches true)
- Opera: **3.48** (matches true)

But this creates a contradiction: your header merges them (“New Age/Space Opera”) while the mean row clearly contains **both** means as separate entries (3.68 and 3.48). So structurally, the table is inconsistent.

**How to fix**
- Correct the column headers so that the mean row aligns with the correct columns:
  - Rename “New Age/Space Opera” → “New Age/Space”
  - Add a separate “Opera” column in the header
- Once split, the mean row is already correct as printed.

### B. Totals / N consistency (implicit issue)
By setting missing categories to 0, your generated table implies each genre’s total N equals the sum of only the 1–5 categories.

In the true table, each genre’s N includes the (M) categories too.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True sum(1–5) = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True missing: 221 + 12 = **233**
- True total N = **1606**
- Generated (with 0 missing) incorrectly implies total N = **1373**, not 1606.

**How to fix**
- Either:
  1) include the correct missing counts (preferred to match the true table), or
  2) if intentionally excluding missing, then remove those rows and clearly state that N excludes (M) categories—and recompute/report N accordingly.  
  But you cannot keep the rows and set them to zero.

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### A. Missing “Opera” column (as its own genre)
True table has **Opera** as a standalone column (Panel 2). Generated table does not.

**How to fix**
- Add the **Opera** column with the true frequencies:
  - Like very much 73
  - Like it 257
  - Mixed feelings 359
  - Dislike it 515
  - Dislike very much 306
  - Don’t know much 83
  - No answer 13
  - Mean 3.48

### B. Incorrect combined label “New Age/Space Opera”
As above: this is not a true category.

**How to fix**
- Use exactly the true labels: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** as separate genres.

---

## What to change to make Generated match True (checklist)

1. **Fix headers**  
   - Replace “New Age/Space Opera” with **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.

2. **Fill in missing-data rows**  
   - Replace all zeros in:
     - (M) Don’t know much about it
     - (M) No answer  
     with the true counts for each genre (values listed above).

3. **Ensure consistent N**  
   - After inserting missing rows correctly, each column should sum to the same total N as the true table for that genre.

If you want, I can rewrite the entire generated table into the exact correct 18-column format matching the true table layout.
