Score: 63/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: missing rows in the generated table
Your **generated table is missing two attitude categories entirely** (they’re present in the true table):

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the generated output, both rows appear but are filled with **all zeros across every genre**, which is incorrect. In the true table, these rows have **nonzero counts for every genre**.

**How to fix**
- Include these two categories as real frequency rows (not placeholders).
- Populate them with the true counts (see section 2).
- Ensure totals per genre reflect all 7 response categories (5 substantive + 2 missingness categories).

---

### 2) Frequency counts: mismatches by response category
All counts for the first five substantive categories **match exactly** between generated and true results for every genre.

The **only frequency mismatches** are the two missingness categories:

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — generated = 0 everywhere (wrong)
Replace the generated zeros with these true counts:

- **Panel 1:**  
  - Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66
- **Panel 2:**  
  - Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78
- **Panel 3:**  
  - Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35

#### (M) No answer — generated = 0 everywhere (wrong)
Replace the generated zeros with these true counts:

- **Panel 1:**  
  - Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11
- **Panel 2:**  
  - Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12
- **Panel 3:**  
  - Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12

**How to fix**
- Do not hard-code missing categories to zero.
- When producing frequency tables, explicitly tabulate all response codes including missingness codes (often “M” categories) from the raw data.

---

### 3) Column categories / genre labels: naming discrepancy
There is **one labeling/structure discrepancy** in the generated column headers compared to the true table:

- True table splits **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** into two separate genre columns.
- Generated headers appear as **“New Age/Space Opera”**, which reads like **one combined genre name**, but the body actually contains **two separate columns worth of numbers** (48/73/… align with New Age/Space and Opera respectively).

So the generated table is *functionally* correct in having two columns, but the **labeling is wrong/ambiguous**.

**How to fix**
- Rename the headers to two distinct columns:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- Ensure the header row has the same number of distinct labels as the number of numeric columns.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (means): mismatches?
**No mismatches in the mean values.** The “Mean” row in the generated output matches the true table for all 18 genres.

However, note: because the generated table incorrectly sets the two missingness rows to zero, it *looks* inconsistent that means still match. This implies the means were computed correctly (likely excluding missing categories), but the displayed missingness frequencies are wrong.

**How to fix**
- Keep the same mean computation rule as the true table (typically computed on valid responses 1–5, excluding missingness).
- But display the correct missingness counts so the table is internally consistent.

---

### 5) Percentages / totals
Neither table shows percentages, so there’s no direct percentage mismatch to report.  
But the generated table, as shown, would produce **incorrect per-genre totals** because it omits the missingness counts (sets them to zero).

**How to fix**
- If you add column totals (optional), compute them using all 7 categories.
- If you compute percentages, clarify the denominator:
  - **Valid %** over categories 1–5 only, or
  - **Total %** over all categories including missingness.

---

## Bottom line: exact list of issues
1) **Missingness rows are incorrect**: “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” are all zeros instead of the true nonzero frequencies.  
2) **Header labeling error**: “New Age/Space Opera” should be split into **two columns** labeled “New Age/Space” and “Opera.”  
3) Everything else (first five category counts and all means) **matches** the true table.
