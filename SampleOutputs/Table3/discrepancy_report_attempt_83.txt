Score: 74/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. “(M) Don’t know much about it” counts are wrong in the Generated Results
In the generated table, the “Don’t know much about it” row is **incorrect for every genre** (all 18).

**True vs Generated (Don’t know much about it):**
- Latin/Salsa: **True 221** vs Gen 116
- Jazz: **38** vs 26
- Blues/R&B: **56** vs 34
- Show Tunes: **77** vs 46
- Oldies: **41** vs 26
- Classical/Chamber: **66** vs 38
- Reggae: **295** vs 153
- Swing/Big Band: **164** vs 88
- New Age/Space: **292** vs 153
- Opera: **83** vs 48
- Bluegrass: **163** vs 87
- Folk: **78** vs 45
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72** vs 42
- Contemporary Rock: **50** vs 31
- Rap: **61** vs 36
- Heavy Metal: **70** vs 40
- Country/Western: **22** vs 16
- Gospel: **35** vs 24

**How to fix:** Replace the entire “(M) Don’t know much about it” row with the true counts above.

---

### B. “(M) No answer” counts are wrong in the Generated Results
In the generated table, the “No answer” row is also **incorrect for every genre** (all 18). It appears to be a duplicated/near-duplicated row rather than the small “No answer” counts in the true table.

**True vs Generated (No answer):**
- Latin/Salsa: **True 12** vs Gen 117
- Jazz: **15** vs 27
- Blues/R&B: **12** vs 34
- Show Tunes: **14** vs 45
- Oldies: **10** vs 25
- Classical/Chamber: **11** vs 39
- Reggae: **11** vs 153
- Swing/Big Band: **12** vs 88
- New Age/Space: **14** vs 153
- Opera: **13** vs 48
- Bluegrass: **11** vs 87
- Folk: **12** vs 45
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13** vs 43
- Contemporary Rock: **12** vs 31
- Rap: **11** vs 36
- Heavy Metal: **10** vs 40
- Country/Western: **10** vs 16
- Gospel: **12** vs 23

**How to fix:** Replace the entire “(M) No answer” row with the true counts above.

## 2) Column/category (genre) structure mismatch

### “New Age/Space Opera” is incorrect / merged incorrectly
- **Generated column:** `New Age/Space Opera` (single combined label)
- **True table has two separate columns in Panel 2:** `New Age/Space` and `Opera`

The generated table *does* contain the correct two sets of numbers (one set corresponds to New Age/Space; the other corresponds to Opera), but the header labeling is wrong because it implies a single genre “New Age/Space Opera” while the data are actually for **two distinct genres**.

**How to fix:**
- Split/rename the headers to match the true table:
  - Column should be **New Age/Space**
  - Column should be **Opera**
- Do **not** merge them into one genre name.

---

## 3) Frequency counts mismatches (non-missing response categories)

### Categories (1) through (5) match perfectly
For all genres, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much

…match the true table exactly.

So the only frequency-count errors are in the two “M” rows.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means match the true table
All reported **Means** in the generated output match the true table (for all 18 genres).

### But the underlying missing-data rows are inconsistent with those means
Even though the means match, the generated missing-category counts (“Don’t know” and “No answer”) are wrong. This implies the mean was computed correctly from the real data (or copied from the true table), but the missing-data frequencies were not.

**How to fix:** Correct the two missing rows; the means can remain as-is since they already match.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

- No genres are missing numerically (all 18 are represented with correct (1)-(5) counts and means).
- The only column-category problem is the **incorrect combined label** `New Age/Space Opera`, which should be **two columns** (or at minimum, two distinct headers).

---

## Likely cause (what went wrong) and the direct fix
### What went wrong
The generated table appears to have:
- Correctly reproduced the (1)–(5) counts and means
- But **mis-handled the missing codes**, likely by:
  - duplicating or partially duplicating a row,
  - using wrong filters for “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer,”
  - or mistakenly pulling counts from another variable/status.

### Direct fix checklist
1. **Replace “(M) Don’t know much about it” counts** with the true values for all 18 genres (listed above).
2. **Replace “(M) No answer” counts** with the true values for all 18 genres (listed above).
3. **Fix genre headers** so `New Age/Space` and `Opera` are distinct columns (not “New Age/Space Opera”).

After these corrections, the generated analysis will match the true table exactly.
