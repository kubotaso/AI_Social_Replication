Score: 70/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: mismatches

**Mismatch A — Missing response categories (rows) in Generated Results**
- In the **Generated Results**, the rows
  - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - **(M) No answer**
  are present but set to **0 for every genre**.
- In the **True Results**, these two rows have **nonzero counts for every genre**.

**How to fix**
- Populate those two rows with the **correct counts** from the True table (listed in section 2 below). Do **not** leave them as all zeros.

---

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (cell-by-cell)

All counts for response categories **(1)–(5)** match the True table across all genres.

The *only* frequency-count mismatches are the two “missing-data” categories that were incorrectly set to zero in the Generated Results.

#### A) Panel 1 genres — counts that must replace the zeros

**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### B) Panel 2 genres — counts that must replace the zeros

**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### C) Panel 3 genres — counts that must replace the zeros

**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

### 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** All means in the Generated Results **match** the True table.

**However:** If the Generated analysis later computes percentages or any “valid N”/total N using the generated table, it will be wrong because the **missing-data rows are zeroed out**, which **changes the denominator**.

**How to fix**
- After inserting correct missing-data counts, ensure any computed:
  - **Total N per genre** = sum of (1)–(5) + (M) Don’t know + (M) No answer
  - **Valid N** (if used) = sum of (1)–(5) only
  - **Percentages**: clarify whether they are based on total N or valid N, and recompute accordingly.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories (variables)

**Mismatch B — Column naming/structure issue for “New Age/Space” and “Opera”**
- The Generated Results has a single combined column labeled **“New Age/Space Opera”**.
- The True Results show this as **two separate columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**

**Important note:** Despite the label issue, the Generated table’s values under “New Age/Space Opera” actually correspond to **New Age/Space** *and* there is also a separate **Opera** column present (with its own counts: 73, 257, 359, 515, 306, mean 3.48). So the problem is primarily a **header/labeling discrepancy**, not a numeric one.

**How to fix**
- Rename headers to match the True table exactly:
  - One column = **New Age/Space**
  - Another column = **Opera**
- Do **not** merge them into one label (“New Age/Space Opera”). If your output format forces single-line headers, use something like:
  - `New Age/Space` and `Opera`
  or
  - `New Age/Space` and `Opera (genre)`.

## Complete list of mismatches (everything that differs)
1. **All cells in “(M) Don’t know much about it” are wrong** (Generated = 0; True = nonzero for every genre).
2. **All cells in “(M) No answer” are wrong** (Generated = 0; True = nonzero for every genre).
3. **Column header mismatch**: “New Age/Space Opera” should not be a merged label; True table has **New Age/Space** and **Opera** as distinct columns (your data appear to already be distinct—just mislabeled).

Everything else (the (1)–(5) counts and the means) matches the True table.
