Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing rows in the Generated Results

### What the true table contains (per genre)
The **true** tables have **7 response rows + Mean**:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  ✅ *nonzero in true table*  
7. **(M) No answer** ✅ *nonzero in true table*  
8. Mean

### What the generated table has
It includes those same row labels, but for the two “M” rows it sets **all entries to 0**:

- (M) Don’t know much about it = **0 for every genre** (incorrect)
- (M) No answer = **0 for every genre** (incorrect)

**Fix:** Populate those two rows with the true frequencies (listed below). The generated analysis must not treat DK/NA as zero; they are real counts.

---

## 2) Column items/categories: incorrect/malformed column structure

### True columns (18 genres)
The true table covers 18 genres, including **New Age/Space** and **Opera** as *separate* columns.

### Generated columns
The generated header contains **“New Age/Space Opera”** as if it were one column name, and **does not include a separate “Opera” column**.

However, the generated table still shows two separate numeric columns worth of data for those concepts (one under “New Age/Space Opera” and one under “Bluegrass”), which indicates a **header shift/misalignment** around that point.

**Fix:** Correct the header so it matches the true columns exactly:

- Replace the single merged label **“New Age/Space Opera”** with **two columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**

Then ensure all subsequent genre labels align with the correct numeric columns (see note: your *counts* for those columns actually match the true table; it’s mainly the header that’s wrong/misaligned).

---

## 3) Frequency count mismatches: genre-by-genre

### For response categories (1)–(5)
All generated counts for rows **(1) through (5)** match the true table for every genre shown.

### For “(M) Don’t know much about it”
Generated: all zeros (wrong).  
True: nonzero. Here are the correct DK (“Don’t know…”) counts that must replace zeros:

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa → Classical/Chamber)**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae → Folk)**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening → Gospel)**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

### For “(M) No answer”
Generated: all zeros (wrong).  
True: nonzero. Correct “No answer” counts:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Insert these values into the generated table, and (if you compute percentages) ensure percentages are based on the full N including DK/NA unless the true table explicitly excludes them.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (Means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The generated **Mean** row matches the true table for all genres:

- Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, Blues/R&B 2.50, Show Tunes 2.59, Oldies 2.25, Classical 2.67,
- Reggae 3.15, Swing 2.45, New Age/Space 3.68, Opera 3.48,
- Bluegrass 2.67, Folk 2.76,
- Pop 2.41, Contemporary Rock 2.67, Rap 3.92, Heavy Metal 4.12, Country 2.32, Gospel 2.39.

So **no mean-value mismatch**—but there *is* a conceptual issue:

**Fix (conceptual):** Ensure the mean calculation excludes the (M) categories (DK/NA) and uses only coded responses 1–5, consistent with typical GSS practice and consistent with the fact that the means match despite DK/NA being nonzero in truth.

### Totals / N (not shown)
Neither table prints totals, but your generated table’s implicit totals are wrong if someone sums all rows, because the two missing-category rows are zeroed out.

**Fix:** After adding DK/NA counts, any computed Ns per genre (if you later report them) must match the true totals.

---

## 5) Percentages: missing entirely
You asked to check “frequency counts or percentages.” The provided outputs show **counts only** (no percentages). So:

- There are **no percentage mismatches to compare** (percentages are simply not present).
- If your generated analysis claimed percentages elsewhere, they would be wrong if based on the incomplete (DK/NA=0) table.

**Fix:** If percentages are required, compute them from the corrected full frequency distributions (including DK and NA as their own categories, or clearly state if excluded).

---

# Summary of required corrections

1. **Add the missing nonzero values** for:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it
   - (M) No answer
2. **Fix the column header structure**:
   - Split “New Age/Space Opera” into **New Age/Space** and **Opera** columns.
   - Verify column alignment after that point.
3. **Keep means as-is** (they already match), but ensure your code computes means using only valid 1–5 responses (excluding M categories).
