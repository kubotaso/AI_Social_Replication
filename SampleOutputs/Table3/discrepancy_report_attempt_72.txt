Score: 89/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatched (names/number of items)

**Mismatch: the “missing/other” rows are wrong in the Generated Results.**  
In the true table, each genre has **7 response rows** before the mean:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it** *(varies by genre)*  
7. **(M) No answer** *(varies by genre)*  
8. Mean

In the Generated Results, after the first five rows, you have:
- a row of **all 13’s** (clearly not a real response distribution row across all genres),
- then a row of larger numbers (looks like it was intended to be “Don’t know much…”),
- then the mean row.

So: **the “No answer” row is incorrect (set to 13 everywhere), and the actual “No answer” counts are missing/merged/misplaced.**

**How to fix**
- Replace the “all 13” row with the **true “No answer” row per genre** (which differs by genre).
- Ensure you include **both** missing rows: “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” with their correct counts per genre.

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

The first five attitude rows **match perfectly** between Generated and True for all 18 genres:

- (1) Like very much ✅  
- (2) Like it ✅  
- (3) Mixed feelings ✅  
- (4) Dislike it ✅  
- (5) Dislike very much ✅  

All mismatches occur in the **two “M” rows**.

#### A) “Don’t know much about it” row (Generated ≈ but not exact)

Compare Generated row (the one with values like 220, 40, 55, 78, 38, 64, …) to True “Don’t know much about it”:

**Latin/Salsa:** Gen 220 vs True 221 (off by -1)  
**Jazz:** 40 vs 38 (off by +2)  
**Blues/R&B:** 55 vs 56 (off by -1)  
**Show Tunes:** 78 vs 77 (off by +1)  
**Oldies:** 38 vs 41 (off by -3)  
**Classical/Chamber:** 64 vs 66 (off by -2)  

**Reggae:** 293 vs 295 (off by -2)  
**Swing/Big Band:** 163 vs 164 (off by -1)  
**New Age/Space:** 293 vs 292 (off by +1)  
**Opera:** 83 vs 83 (match)  
**Bluegrass:** 161 vs 163 (off by -2)  
**Folk:** 77 vs 78 (off by -1)

**Pop/Easy Listening:** 72 vs 72 (match)  
**Contemporary Rock:** 49 vs 50 (off by -1)  
**Rap:** 59 vs 61 (off by -2)  
**Heavy Metal:** 67 vs 70 (off by -3)  
**Country/Western:** 19 vs 22 (off by -3)  
**Gospel:** 34 vs 35 (off by -1)

**How to fix**
- Replace that generated “DK” row with the exact true counts genre-by-genre shown in Table 3.

#### B) “No answer” row (completely wrong)

Generated has **13 for every genre**, but True “No answer” varies:

- Latin/Salsa 12 (≠13)
- Jazz 15 (≠13)
- Blues/R&B 12 (≠13)
- Show Tunes 14 (≠13)
- Oldies 10 (≠13)
- Classical/Chamber 11 (≠13)
- Reggae 11 (≠13)
- Swing/Big Band 12 (≠13)
- New Age/Space 14 (≠13)
- Opera 13 (=13)  ← only one that matches
- Bluegrass 11 (≠13)
- Folk 12 (≠13)
- Pop/Easy Listening 13 (=13)
- Contemporary Rock 12 (≠13)
- Rap 11 (≠13)
- Heavy Metal 10 (≠13)
- Country/Western 10 (≠13)
- Gospel 12 (≠13)

**How to fix**
- Add/restore the proper **No answer** row with these values (and do not reuse a constant 13).

---

### 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

#### Means
The mean row in Generated matches the True means to the displayed precision (minor rounding only, e.g., 3.142753 vs 3.14). ✅

#### Totals / internal consistency (implied issue)
Because the two missing rows are wrong, the **per-genre total N** implied by Generated counts will not match the True total N for many genres.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total = 85+325+416+403+144+220+13 = **1606** (coincidentally matches)
But other genres won’t (because DK and NA errors don’t offset consistently).

**How to fix**
- After correcting DK and No answer rows, recompute totals (if you report them) and verify each genre column sums to the correct N.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

**Columns (genres) match exactly**: all 18 genres present, no extras, no missing. ✅  
No column-name discrepancies detected (e.g., “Classical/Chamber”, “Pop/Easy Listening”, etc. match).

---

## Concrete correction to make Generated match True

1. Keep rows 1–5 as-is (they already match).
2. Replace the generated “Don’t know much about it” row with the True DK row values for each genre.
3. Replace the “all 13” row with the True “No answer” row values for each genre.
4. Retain the mean row (already consistent), optionally round to 2 decimals to match the true table formatting.

If you want, I can rewrite the Generated table into the exact correct Table 3 layout (18 genres × 8 rows) using the True counts.
