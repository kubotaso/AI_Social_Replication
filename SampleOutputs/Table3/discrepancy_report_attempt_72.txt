Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing and mislabeled

### A. Missing response rows in the generated table
Your generated table **omits** the non-substantive response categories by setting them all to 0:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
- **(M) No answer**

In the true table, these rows are **not zero** for every genre; they contain substantial counts.

**Fix:** Add the two missing rows with the correct counts (see Section 2), and ensure totals per genre include them.

### B. Column/genre name discrepancy: “Opera” merged into header text
In the generated header you have a single column label:

- **“New Age/Space Opera”**

But the true table has **two separate columns**:

- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

So the generated table is missing an entire genre column (**Opera**) and has an incorrect combined label.

**Fix:** Split “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**:  
1) *New Age/Space*  
2) *Opera*  
and populate each with its own frequencies/mean.

### C. Number of items/genres mismatch
True table covers **18 genres**:
- Panel 1: 6
- Panel 2: 6
- Panel 3: 6  
Total = 18.

Generated table effectively has **17 genre columns** because it incorrectly fuses *New Age/Space* and *Opera*.

**Fix:** After splitting the column, the generated table will have the correct **18** genres.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

### Good news: the 1–5 substantive categories match
For every genre shown, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly** (including the values under New Age/Space and Opera—*but only because the generated column is mistakenly being treated as one*; see below).

### All mismatches are in the “M” rows (and Opera column structure)

#### A. (M) Don’t know much about it — generated all zeros, true is nonzero
True counts you must insert (by genre):

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix:** Replace the generated zeros in this row with the above values, and ensure New Age/Space and Opera are separated.

#### B. (M) No answer — generated all zeros, true is nonzero
True counts you must insert (by genre):

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the generated zeros in this row with the above values.

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: numerically they match, but they were computed/represented inconsistently
The generated **Mean** row matches the true mean values *as printed*. However, because your generated table incorrectly sets the M categories to zero and fuses “New Age/Space” + “Opera,” it strongly suggests:

- either the means were copied from the true table (not recomputed from your displayed counts), or
- the means were computed using underlying data that included M categories correctly, but your frequency table output did not.

**Fix:** Recompute and/or validate that the mean is calculated on the same base as the true table (typically excluding M categories), and ensure the frequency table shown corresponds to the same data.

### Totals (implicit) will be wrong in the generated table
Even though totals are not explicitly printed, anyone summing rows in your generated output will get totals that are **too small** for every genre because you set M categories to 0.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- Generated total = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True total adds M rows: 1373 + 221 + 12 = **1606**

This issue exists for every genre.

**Fix:** Include M rows so column totals match the true table. If you also report percentages, they must use the correct denominators (including M categories unless explicitly excluded).

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column: Opera (as its own genre)
Opera is missing as a separate column due to the merged header.

**Fix:** Add an **Opera** column with the true values (Panel 2):

Opera:
- Like very much **73**
- Like it **257**
- Mixed feelings **359**
- Dislike it **515**
- Dislike very much **306**
- Don’t know much about it **83**
- No answer **13**
- Mean **3.48**

### Incorrect column name: “New Age/Space Opera”
**Fix:** Rename/split into:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

New Age/Space:
- Like very much **48**
- Like it **186**
- Mixed feelings **269**
- Dislike it **429**
- Dislike very much **368**
- Don’t know much about it **292**
- No answer **14**
- Mean **3.68**

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1) **Split the combined genre column** “New Age/Space Opera” into **two separate columns**: *New Age/Space* and *Opera*.  
2) **Populate the two M rows** with the correct nonzero counts for every genre:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it
   - (M) No answer
3) **Ensure any totals/percentages/means** are computed using the same rules as the true table (especially whether M categories are excluded from mean calculations but included in total N).

If you want, paste the code or logic that produced the generated table and I can point to the exact step where M categories were dropped and where the column name/structure caused Opera to be merged.
