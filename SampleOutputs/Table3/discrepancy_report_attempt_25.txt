Score: 73/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories: missing, extra, and mislabeled

### A. Missing attitude rows in the generated table
The **true Table 3** has **8 rows** per genre:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
7. **(M) No answer**  
8. Mean  

The **generated results** include:
- Rows 1–6 as numeric rows
- A row of **all zeros** (intended to be “No answer” but wrong)
- Mean row

So the generated output is missing the *actual* “Don’t know much about it” row values (it instead contains a row that matches something else—see below), and it has an incorrect “No answer” row.

**Fix:** Add two explicit missing-data rows with the correct labels and counts:
- `(M) Don’t know much about it`
- `(M) No answer`
…and populate them with the true counts (see sections below).

### B. Extra/incorrect all-zero row
The generated table includes a row that is **0 for every genre**. In the true table, “No answer” is **not zero** (e.g., Latin/Salsa=12, Jazz=15, etc.).

**Fix:** Remove the all-zero row and replace it with the correct “No answer” counts.

### C. Column/genre coverage
The generated table includes all 18 genres (same as true Table 3):  
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No genre columns are missing or extra. Column names match closely enough.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

### Rows (1)–(5): Like/Dislike categories
For all genres, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly**.

No fixes needed there.

### Row intended as “Don’t know much about it”: mismatches
In the **true table**, “Don’t know much about it” values are:

- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66  
- Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35

In the **generated results**, the 6th numeric row is:
- Latin/Salsa 233; Jazz 53; Blues/R&B 68; Show Tunes 91; Oldies 51; Classical/Chamber 77  
- Reggae 306; Swing/Big Band 176; New Age/Space 306; Opera 96; Bluegrass 174; Folk 90  
- Pop/Easy Listening 85; Contemporary Rock 62; Rap 72; Heavy Metal 80; Country/Western 32; Gospel 47

These generated values **do not match** the true “Don’t know much about it” row. They are systematically higher.

**Fix:** Replace that entire generated row with the correct “Don’t know much about it” counts listed above.

### Row intended as “No answer”: mismatches
The true “No answer” row is:

- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11  
- Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12

The generated “No answer” row is **all zeros**, which is wrong for every genre.

**Fix:** Replace the all-zero row with the correct “No answer” counts above.

---

## 3) Percentages: missing entirely
The prompt asks to check “frequency counts or percentages.” The **true table provides counts (and means), not percentages**. The generated table also provides counts, not percentages.

So:
- There are **no percentage mismatches**, but
- If your generated analysis was supposed to include percentages, it is **missing percentage columns/rows entirely**.

**Fix (only if percentages are required):**
For each genre, compute percentages using the correct denominator:
- If you want percentages of all responses including missing categories, denominator = sum of all 7 non-mean rows.
- If you want valid percentages excluding missing, denominator = sum of rows (1)–(5) only.

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals)

### Means
The generated mean row values match the true means to the displayed precision for all genres:
- e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ 3.14, Jazz 2.60528 ≈ 2.61, etc.

**No fixes needed** for means.

### Implied totals / Ns (important discrepancy)
Even though means match, the **generated missing rows are wrong**, which makes the **total N per genre wrong** if someone sums rows.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total = 85+325+416+403+144 +221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total (using its wrong “DK” row and 0 “No answer”) = 85+325+416+403+144 +233+0 = **1606**

So totals coincidentally match for Latin/Salsa, but that’s because the generated “DK” row appears to be **DK + No answer combined** (221+12=233). This pattern holds across genres:

Check Jazz:
- True DK 38 + No answer 15 = **53** = generated 6th-row value (53)

So the generated 6th row is not “Don’t know much about it”; it is **(Don’t know much about it + No answer)**, and then the separate “No answer” row was incorrectly set to 0.

**Fix:** Split the generated combined-missing row into two correct rows:
- `(M) Don’t know much about it` = (combined missing) − (No answer)
- `(M) No answer` = true “No answer”

But since you already have the true table, simplest fix is: directly insert the true DK and No answer counts.

## 5) What to change so generated output matches the true table (exact edits)

1. **Relabel rows** (so they match the true category labels), ensuring 8 rows:
   - (1) Like very much  
   - (2) Like it  
   - (3) Mixed feelings  
   - (4) Dislike it  
   - (5) Dislike very much  
   - (M) Don’t know much about it  
   - (M) No answer  
   - Mean  

2. **Replace the generated 6th row** (currently combined missing) with the **true “Don’t know much about it”** counts (row values shown above).

3. **Replace the all-zero row** with the **true “No answer”** counts (row values shown above).

After those fixes, the generated table will align with Table 3 exactly (counts and means), and the missing categories will no longer be collapsed/mislabeled.
