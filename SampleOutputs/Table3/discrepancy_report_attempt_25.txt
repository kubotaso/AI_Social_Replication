Score: 73/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names/number of items)

**A. Missing response rows in the generated table**
- **Generated** includes these rows but sets them all to 0:
  - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - **(M) No answer**
- **True table** has **nonzero counts** for both of these rows for *every* genre.

**Fix:** Populate the two “M” rows with the correct counts from the true table (see section 2). Do **not** leave them as zeros.

---

### 2) Frequency-count mismatches (by row/category)

All “(1) Like very much” through “(5) Dislike very much” counts in the generated table **match** the true table for every genre.

The **only frequency mismatches** are that the generated table reports **0** for all cells in:
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

Below are the correct values that must replace the zeros.

#### Panel 1 genres (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2 genres (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3 genres (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace every zero in those two rows with the correct counts above.

---

### 3) Summary-statistic mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** The generated mean row **matches** the true table for all 18 genres (no discrepancies).

**However, a hidden inconsistency exists:**  
Because the generated table sets the two “M” rows to zero, the **implied total N per genre** (summing rows) is **too small** compared to the true table.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- Generated total (only categories 1–5): 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True total adds missing categories: 1373 + 221 + 12 = **1606**

This same undercount happens for every genre.

**Fix:** After inserting correct “M” counts, any computed totals/valid-Ns should be recomputed consistently (even if totals are not shown, they affect downstream percentages and sample-size reporting).

---

### 4) Missing/extra column categories (genre columns)

**A. Incorrect column naming / structural issue**
- In the generated header you have **“New Age/Space Opera”** as if it were one combined column label.
- In the true table, **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** are **two separate genres/columns**.

Despite the label issue, the generated table actually contains both sets of counts (New Age/Space counts and Opera counts) in adjacent positions—so the **data appear present**, but the **column header is wrong/merged**.

**Fix options (choose one):**
1. **Split into two distinct columns** with exact names:
   - “New Age/Space”
   - “Opera”
2. If your output format requires single-line headers, ensure a delimiter (e.g., comma or pipe) so it’s not interpreted as one combined variable name.

**B. No extra or missing genre columns otherwise**
- The generated table includes all 18 genres present in the true table (once “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are treated separately).

---

### 5) Percentages
- Neither table shows percentages; only counts and means are shown.
- Therefore there are **no percentage mismatches to audit** here.
- But if the generated analysis elsewhere computed percentages using the (incorrect) smaller totals (excluding “M” categories), those percentages would be wrong.

**Fix:** When calculating percentages, use the correct denominator (typically total responses including “don’t know”/“no answer” if you’re reporting distribution of all cases; or exclude them intentionally but then state “valid percent” and recompute accordingly).

---

## Required corrections to make the generated table match the true table
1. **Fill in nonzero counts** for:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it”
   - “(M) No answer”
   for every genre (values listed above).
2. **Correct the column structure/labeling** so that:
   - “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are distinct columns (not a merged header).
3. **Recompute any totals/percentages downstream** using the corrected counts and explicit rules about whether M categories are included in denominators.

If you want, I can also produce a corrected “Generated Results” table in the same layout as yours with all missing cells filled and the headers fixed.
