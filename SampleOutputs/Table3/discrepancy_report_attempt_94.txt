### 1) Row items/categories: **mismatches and missing rows**

**Generated table is missing two required attitude categories** that are present in the true Table 3:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In your generated output, those two rows appear only as **two rows of `NaN`** (i.e., blank/missing across all genres), instead of showing the real counts.

**How to fix**
- Ensure your frequency table includes **7 rows** per genre:  
  (1) Like very much; (2) Like it; (3) Mixed feelings; (4) Dislike it; (5) Dislike very much; **(M) Don’t know much about it; (M) No answer**  
- Populate the last two rows with the correct counts (listed below in section 2).

### 2) Frequency counts: **all mismatches**

For response categories (1)–(5), the generated counts **match** the true table for every genre.

The **only frequency-count mismatches** are the two missing “M” rows (they are `NaN` in Generated, but have non-missing values in True). Below are the correct values that must replace those `NaN`s.

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — **missing in Generated**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### (M) No answer — **missing in Generated**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- When generating the frequency table, don’t drop or coerce non-substantive response codes (often DK/NA) to missing.
- Explicitly include “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” as valid categories when tabulating (e.g., treat them as factor levels / categorical levels).

### 3) Percentages: **not present (missing columns)**

The user request mentions “frequency counts or percentages,” but:

- **True Table 3 provides counts and mean only (no percentages).**
- **Generated output also provides counts and mean only (no percentages).**

So there is **no direct percentage mismatch**, but if your generated analysis was *supposed* to include percentages, then it is missing an entire set of percentage columns.

**How to fix (only if percentages are required)**
- Add percentage columns computed using a consistent denominator:
  - Either **include all responses including M categories** in the denominator, or
  - Compute percentages only among substantive responses (1–5) and state that clearly.
- The true table does not show percentages, so adding them would make your output *different in structure* unless requested.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.): **means match; totals not shown**

**Means:** The generated “Mean” row matches the true table (allowing for rounding) for all 18 genres:

- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ **3.14**
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ **2.61**
- Blues/R&B 2.5 = **2.50**
- …  
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ **4.12**
- Gospel 2.394484 ≈ **2.39**

**Totals / N:** Neither table displays explicit totals per genre, but because the M rows are missing in the generated table, **any total-N you compute from the generated table will be wrong** (it will undercount by DK + NA).

**How to fix**
- After adding the two M rows, recompute any totals (if you report them elsewhere).
- If you compute means from the distribution, make sure the mean is computed on the same basis as the true table (typically using codes 1–5 and excluding M categories). Your means already align, suggesting you did exclude M categories correctly—but you failed to *report* their counts.

---

### 5) Missing/extra column categories: **structure differs vs. the true presentation**

- **True Table 3 is presented as three separate 6-column subtables** (6 genres at a time).
- **Generated output presents all 18 genres in one wide table.**

This is not numerically wrong, but it **does not match the true table layout**.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to mirror the true table, split the output into the same three panels:
  1) Latin/Salsa–Classical/Chamber  
  2) Reggae–Folk  
  3) Pop/Easy Listening–Gospel  
- Keep identical row labels including the two (M) categories.

---

## Bottom line: what must be corrected
1) Replace the two `NaN` rows with the correct counts for:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it
   - (M) No answer  
2) (Optional formatting) Split into three subtables like the true table if you need the presentation to match exactly.  
3) If you compute/report totals elsewhere, recompute them after restoring the missing M categories.
