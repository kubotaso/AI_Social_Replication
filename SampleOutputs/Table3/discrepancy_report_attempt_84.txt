Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatched (names + number of items)

### A. Missing rows in the **Generated Results**
Your generated table only includes these 8 rows (implicitly):
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. **(all zeros row)**  
8. Mean  

But the **true** Table 3 has **8 substantive rows** with the 7th row being:
- **(M) No answer** (NOT a row of zeros)

So the generated table is **missing the “(M) No answer” counts** and instead has an incorrect **all‑zero row**.

**Fix:** Replace the all-zero row with the correct **(M) No answer** frequency row for each genre.

---

### B. Incorrect value row for “Don’t know much about it” for many genres
In the generated table, the 6th row is intended to be “Don’t know much about it”, but for many columns it does **not** match the true “Don’t know” row (details below).

**Fix:** Overwrite the 6th-row values to match the true table’s “Don’t know much about it” counts.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by column/genre)

Below I list every genre where the generated frequencies differ from the true Table 3. (All “Like/Mixed/Dislike” rows appear to match; almost all errors are in the two “missing value” rows.)

### Latin/Salsa
- **Don’t know much about it**: Generated **233**, True **221** → mismatch **(+12)**
- **No answer**: Generated **0**, True **12** → mismatch (missing)

**Fix:** Set Don’t know=221; No answer=12.

---

### Jazz
- **Don’t know much about it**: Generated **53**, True **38** → mismatch **(+15)**
- **No answer**: Generated **0**, True **15** → mismatch (missing)

**Fix:** Set Don’t know=38; No answer=15.

---

### Blues/R&B
- **Don’t know much about it**: Generated **68**, True **56** → mismatch **(+12)**

- **No answer**: Generated **0**, True **12** → mismatch (missing)

**Fix:** Set Don’t know=35; No answer=12.

---

## 3) Percentages
Neither the generated output nor the true table shows percentages. So:
- **No percentage mismatches can be evaluated**, because percentages are not present in either.

**Fix (if percentages are desired):** Compute them from the true counts using the per-genre total \(N\) (including missing categories if you want “percent of all cases”, or excluding them if you want “percent of valid responses”). But you must specify which denominator.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The generated “Mean” row matches the true table (to rounding) for all genres shown:
- e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.142753 vs True 3.14, etc.

So **no mean mismatches** are evident.

### Implicit totals / N consistency issue
Even though means match, the **generated missing-category counts are wrong**, which implies your generated table’s totals per genre would not match the true totals.

In fact, the pattern in your generated table strongly suggests this systematic error:

- Your generated **“Don’t know much about it”** row appears to equal **(True Don’t know + True No answer)**.
  - Example Latin/Salsa: True DK 221 + True NA 12 = **233** (your generated DK)
  - Jazz: 38 + 15 = **53**
  - Etc. (this holds across all genres)

And then your generated “No answer” row is **all zeros**.

**Fix:** Split missing responses into the two separate categories:
- Don’t know much about it = true DK only  
- No answer = true NA only  
Do **not** combine them into a single row.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns/genres
The generated table includes all **18 genres** that appear in the true Table 3:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

So there are **no missing/extra genre columns**.

### Row labels are missing in the generated output
The true table has explicit row labels (1)–(5), (M) DK, (M) No answer, Mean; your generated output has **no row labels**, making it ambiguous and helping the “all zeros” row slip in unnoticed.

**Fix:** Add explicit row names and verify ordering matches the true table:
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
(M) Don’t know much about it  
(M) No answer  
Mean

## Root cause + how to correct the analysis pipeline
**Root cause:** “No answer” was incorrectly merged into “Don’t know much about it”, and then “No answer” was output as zeros.

**How to fix:**
1. When tabulating, keep **distinct codes** for:
   - Don’t know
   - No answer
2. If your code is doing something like `missing = DK + NA`, stop aggregating them.
3. Ensure the output table prints both rows separately (and remove the spurious all-zero row).

If you paste the code (R/Stata/Python/SPSS) that produced the generated table, I can point to the exact line(s) causing the DK/NA collapse and show the corrected version.
