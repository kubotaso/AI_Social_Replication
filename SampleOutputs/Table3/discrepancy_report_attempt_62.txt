Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories mismatches

### A. **“Opera” is missing as its own column**
- **True table (Panel 2)** has **two separate columns**: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.
- **Generated table** merges them into a single column labeled **“New Age/Space Opera”**.

**How to fix**
- Split the merged column into **two columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- Then assign each the correct counts from the true table (see Section 2B).

---

### B. **Column set is otherwise correct (18 genres), but mislabeled**
- True: 18 genres = 6 (Panel 1) + 6 (Panel 2) + 6 (Panel 3)
- Generated: also shows 18 genre columns, but only because it *combined* “New Age/Space” + “Opera” into one, which masks the structure error.

**How to fix**
- Ensure the output preserves the exact genre list and names as in the true table:
  - Use **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** separately.

---

### C. Response-category rows are correct in name and order
Rows:
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
(M) Don’t know much about it  
(M) No answer  
Mean  

No naming/order issues there.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (cell-by-cell)

Everything in the generated table **matches the true table** for Panels 1 and 3, *except* the “Don’t know” and “No answer” rows in many genres, plus the merged New Age/Opera issue.

Below are **all mismatched cells**.

---

### A. Panel 1 mismatches (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — **all 6 are wrong**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Latin/Salsa | 198 | 221 | change to **221** |
| Jazz | 48 | 38 | change to **38** |
| Blues/R&B | 63 | 56 | change to **56** |
| Show Tunes | 83 | 77 | change to **77** |
| Oldies | 48 | 41 | change to **41** |
| Classical/Chamber | 70 | 66 | change to **66** |

#### (M) No answer — **all 6 are wrong**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Latin/Salsa | 35 | 12 | change to **12** |
| Jazz | 5 | 15 | change to **15** |
| Blues/R&B | 5 | 12 | change to **12** |
| Show Tunes | 8 | 14 | change to **14** |
| Oldies | 3 | 10 | change to **10** |
| Classical/Chamber | 7 | 11 | change to **11** |

All other rows (1–5) and the **means** for Panel 1 match.

---

### B. Panel 2 mismatches (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)

#### First: fix the **merged column**
Generated has one column: **“New Age/Space Opera”** with counts:
- Like very much 48, Like it 186, Mixed 269, Dislike 429, Dislike very much 368  
These numbers match **New Age/Space** (not Opera).

But because Opera is missing, Opera’s counts never appear, and the “Don’t know” / “No answer” counts are also wrong.

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — **wrong for all 6**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Reggae | 259 | 295 | change to **295** |
| Swing/Big Band | 163 | 164 | change to **164** |
| New Age/Space | 228 | 292 | change to **292** |
| Opera | **missing** | 83 | add Opera column; set to **83** |
| Bluegrass | 76 | 163 | change to **163** |
| Folk | 158 | 78 | change to **78** |

#### (M) No answer — **wrong for all 6**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Reggae | 47 | 11 | change to **11** |
| Swing/Big Band | 13 | 12 | change to **12** |
| New Age/Space | 78 | 14 | change to **14** |
| Opera | **missing** | 13 | add Opera column; set to **13** |
| Bluegrass | 20 | 11 | change to **11** |
| Folk | 16 | 12 | change to **12** |

#### Opera column — **entirely missing**
Add **Opera** with the true frequencies:
- Like very much **73**
- Like it **257**
- Mixed feelings **359**
- Dislike it **515**
- Dislike very much **306**
- Don’t know **83**
- No answer **13**
- Mean **3.48**

**Important:** those Opera values are currently being incorrectly “shifted” conceptually into the merged label; you must represent them separately.

All “1–5” rows and means for Reggae, Swing, New Age, Bluegrass, Folk already match the true table *except* Opera’s absence (and the missing-data rows as shown).

---

### C. Panel 3 mismatches (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — **wrong for all 6**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Pop/Easy Listening | 79 | 72 | change to **72** |
| Contemporary Rock | 56 | 50 | change to **50** |
| Rap | 49 | 61 | change to **61** |
| Heavy Metal | 51 | 70 | change to **70** |
| Country/Western | 30 | 22 | change to **22** |
| Gospel | 44 | 35 | change to **35** |

#### (M) No answer — **wrong for all 6**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Pop/Easy Listening | 6 | 13 | change to **13** |
| Contemporary Rock | 6 | 12 | change to **12** |
| Rap | 23 | 11 | change to **11** |
| Heavy Metal | 29 | 10 | change to **10** |
| Country/Western | 2 | 10 | change to **10** |
| Gospel | 3 | 12 | change to **12** |

All “1–5” rows and means for Panel 3 match.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- **All reported means in the generated table match** the true table **for the genres shown**.
- However, because **Opera is missing as a separate column**, the generated output is **structurally not matching** the true table even if the displayed mean values for the merged “New Age/Space Opera” column happen to equal New Age/Space.

**How to fix**
- After splitting **New Age/Space** and **Opera**, ensure the mean row includes:
  - New Age/Space mean = **3.68**
  - Opera mean = **3.48**

### Totals / Ns
- The tables don’t explicitly show totals, but your generated table’s **missing-data counts differ**, meaning any computed Ns per genre would differ from the true table.

**How to fix**
- Replace all “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts with the true values listed above.
- Recompute any totals/Ns if you are calculating them downstream.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

- **Missing column:** Opera (must be its own column)
- **Extra/invalid column label:** “New Age/Space Opera” (should not exist)

**How to fix**
- Rename and split into two columns exactly as in the true table:
  - New Age/Space
  - Opera

---

## What likely caused the errors (so you can prevent them)
1. **Header parsing error**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera” were concatenated.
2. **Systematic miscopy of missing-data rows**: Most (M) rows were replaced with incorrect values (possibly from another version of the table, a different year, or misaligned column reads).

If you want, paste how the generated table was produced (code/prompt/steps), and I can point to the exact parsing/join step that caused the systematic (M) row corruption and the New Age/Opera merge.
