Score: 80/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### A. Missing rows in **Generated Results**
The **Generated** table includes these attitude rows:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much
- (M) Don’t know much about it
- (M) No answer
- Mean

But it incorrectly sets the two “missing-data” rows to **0 for every genre**.

In the **True** table, both of these rows have **non-zero counts for every genre**:
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**: nonzero across all 18 genres
- **(M) No answer**: nonzero across all 18 genres

**Fix:** Populate both (M) rows with the true counts (see section 2). Do not hard-code them to zero.

### B. Column/category naming discrepancy: “New Age/Space Opera”
- **Generated column header:** `New Age/Space Opera`
- **True table headers:** `New Age/Space` **and** a separate column `Opera`

In the true table, **“Opera” is its own genre**, and “New Age/Space” is another. The generated header incorrectly fuses them into one label.

**Fix:** Rename the generated `New Age/Space Opera` column to **New Age/Space** and ensure **Opera** remains a separate column (which it currently does). Do not merge these labels.

### C. Number of items/genres
Both tables cover **18 genres**. No genre is missing or extra in the generated set, but the **labeling** is misleading (see above).

---

## 2) Frequency-count mismatches (and where they occur)

### Key issue: all missing-data frequencies are wrong
For every genre, the generated table reports:
- (M) Don’t know much about it = **0**
- (M) No answer = **0**

But the true table has the following non-zero values. These are **mismatches for every single genre**.

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** (True → Generated should match):
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the generated zeros with these true counts.

### Everything else (rows 1–5 and Mean) matches
All the following appear to match exactly between Generated and True:
- Counts for (1)–(5) for all 18 genres
- Mean values for all 18 genres

So the mismatches are concentrated entirely in the **missing-data rows** plus the **New Age/Space Opera** labeling issue.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The **Mean** row values in the generated output match the True table values for all genres.

### Implicit totals / denominators (not displayed but affected)
Even though totals/percentages are not shown, the generated table implicitly assumes **no missing data** (because it set missing rows to zero). That makes any:
- column totals,
- valid-N calculations,
- percentage distributions,
- mean recomputation from counts,

**incorrect** if derived from the generated table.

**Fix:** Once you correct the (M) rows, any totals/percentages derived from the table will align with the true source.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### No missing genres, but one mislabeled header
- **Problem:** `New Age/Space Opera` (generated) suggests a combined category that does not exist in the true table.
- **True structure:** two distinct genres: `New Age/Space` and `Opera`.

**Fix:** Change header text to `New Age/Space` (and keep `Opera` separate).

---

## What to change so Generated matches True (minimal edit list)

1) **Replace all zeros** in `(M) Don’t know much about it` and `(M) No answer` with the true counts listed above (for every genre).
2) **Rename** the column header `New Age/Space Opera` → **New Age/Space** (since Opera is already its own column).

After those corrections, the generated table will match the true frequency table (counts and means).
