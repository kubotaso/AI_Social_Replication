Score: 77/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing rows)

**Generated table is missing two response categories entirely (set to all zeros):**
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the **true table**, both rows have **nonzero counts for every genre**.

**How to fix**
- Add the two “M” rows and populate them with the correct counts from the true table (see section 2 below).
- Do **not** treat them as 0 or as absent; they are part of the frequency distribution.

---

### 2) Frequency-count mismatches (by row/genre)

All counts for rows **(1)–(5)** and **Mean** match the true table.  
**The only count mismatches are in the two “M” rows**, where the generated results incorrectly show **0 for all genres**.

#### Correct values that must replace the generated zeros

**(M) Don’t know much about it** (replace the entire row of zeros with these):
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer** (replace the entire row of zeros with these):
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

### 3) Row/column naming issues (category labels)

There is a **column label mismatch** for the New Age / Space Opera split:

- **Generated column:** `New Age/Space`
- **True table has two columns:** `New Age/Space` **and** `Opera` (shown as “New Age/Space” and “Opera” in Panel 2)

In your generated header it appears as **“New Age/Space Opera”** (merged/ambiguous), but the body clearly contains **two separate columns** (one for New Age/Space and one for Opera), with values matching the true table.

**How to fix**
- Ensure the headers are split into **two distinct columns**:
  - `New Age/Space`
  - `Opera`
- Remove the merged label “New Age/Space Opera” (or replace it with two separate headers).

---

### 4) Missing/extra column categories

- **Number of genres:** Generated includes 18 genres (correct).
- **No extra genres** appear.
- The only column problem is the **header formatting/merging** for **New Age/Space vs Opera** (see #3).

---

### 5) Percentages / summary-statistics mismatches

- **Means:** All generated means match the true means.
- **Percentages:** Neither table shows percentages, only counts and mean. So there are **no percentage mismatches to check**. (If you intended percentages, they are missing from *both* outputs and would need to be computed from totals.)

**However, the generated table is internally incomplete as a frequency distribution** because it omits nonresponse categories (sets them to 0). That means any totals computed from the generated table would be wrong.

**How to fix totals/derived stats**
- After inserting the correct “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts, recompute:
  - **Column totals (N) per genre**
  - Any **valid-percent** calculations (excluding missing) or **overall percent** (including missing), depending on your definition.

---

## Bottom line fixes to make generated match true
1. Replace the all-zero **(M) Don’t know much about it** row with the true nonzero counts.
2. Replace the all-zero **(M) No answer** row with the true nonzero counts.
3. Correct the column header so **New Age/Space** and **Opera** are clearly separated (not merged into “New Age/Space Opera”).
4. If producing any totals/percents, recompute them after restoring the missing rows.
