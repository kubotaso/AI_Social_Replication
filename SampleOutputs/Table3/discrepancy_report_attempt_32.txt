Score: 75/100
============================================================

## 1) Wrong table/output type (major mismatch)
- **Generated Results** are a numeric matrix for **18 music genres only** (Table 3), showing 5 attitude rows + 2 NaN rows + mean.
- **True Results** include **three tables** (Table 1 regression, Table 2 regression, Table 3 frequencies).

**Mismatch:** Generated output **omits Table 1 and Table 2 entirely** (all regression coefficients, constants, R², adjusted R², N, significance stars, footnotes).

**Fix:** If your “generated analysis” is supposed to match the full “True Results,” you must generate **three separate tables**:
1) Table 1 regression coefficients (3 model columns)  
2) Table 2 regression coefficients (2 model columns)  
3) Table 3 frequency distributions (18 genres)

If you only intended to reproduce Table 3, then the “True Results” comparison should be limited to Table 3 only.

---

## 2) Row items/categories mismatches (Table 3)
### A) Missing attitude categories (rows)
In the **True Table 3**, each genre has **7 rows + Mean**:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

In the **Generated Results**, you have:
- 5 numeric rows (corresponding to 1–5)
- **two rows of NaN**
- mean row

**Mismatch:** The rows **“Don’t know much about it”** and **“No answer”** are present as **NaN** instead of the correct counts.

**Fix:** Replace the two NaN rows with the correct “M” counts from the true table for every genre (see Section 3).

### B) Row labels are missing
The generated matrix shows raw numbers without the **attitude labels**.

**Fix:** Add row names exactly as in the true table:
- “(1) Like very much”, …, “(5) Dislike very much”, “(M) Don’t know much about it”, “(M) No answer”, “Mean”.

---

## 3) Frequency-count mismatches
### Good news: rows (1)–(5) match exactly
For all 18 genres, the **first five rows** in the Generated Results match the True Table 3 counts (e.g., Latin/Salsa 85/325/416/403/144; Jazz 254/540/393/297/69; etc.).

### All mismatches are the “M” rows (they are NaN but should be counts)
Below are the **exact values that must replace the two NaN rows**.

#### Replace NaN row #1 with: “(M) Don’t know much about it”
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### Replace NaN row #2 with: “(M) No answer”
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

## 4) Percentages / column categories
- **True Table 3** reports **counts only** (no percentages).
- **Generated Results** also reports **counts only**.

**Mismatch:** None on “percentages” because neither table provides them.  
**Fix (only if you intended percentages):** Add percentage columns based on each genre’s valid N or total N (but then you would no longer match the published “True Results,” which are counts).

---

## 5) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)
### Means
The generated mean row values match the True Table 3 means (minor rounding differences only):
- Example: Latin/Salsa **3.142753 vs 3.14** (true table rounds to 2 decimals)
- Jazz **2.60528 vs 2.61**, etc.

**Mismatch:** Only **formatting/rounding** (generated has many decimals; true has 2 decimals).

**Fix:** Round means to **two decimal places** to match the true presentation.

### Totals / N
True Table 3 does not explicitly print totals per genre, but totals are implied by summing the 7 response categories. Your generated table currently cannot reproduce those totals correctly because the two “M” rows are NaN.

**Fix:** Once the two missing “M” rows are filled with the correct counts, totals per genre will align with the published distribution.

---

## 6) Missing/extra columns (Table 3)
- The **set of 18 genre columns** in Generated Results matches the True Table 3 genre list exactly:
  Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

**Mismatch:** None in column names/count.

---

## What to change to make the generated output match the true tables
1) **Decide scope**:
   - If matching all “True Results”: generate **Table 1 + Table 2 + Table 3**.
   - If matching only Table 3: don’t include Tables 1–2 in the “True Results” comparison.

2) **For Table 3 specifically**:
   - Replace the two NaN rows with the exact “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts listed above.
   - Add the attitude row labels.
   - Round the mean row to **2 decimals**.

After those fixes, the generated Table 3 will match the true Table 3 exactly (counts) and match the displayed mean formatting.
