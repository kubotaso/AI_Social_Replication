Score: 69/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

**Mismatch: missing response rows in Generated Results**
- The **True Results** have **7 attitude rows** before the mean:
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
  7. **(M) No answer**
- The **Generated Results include the last two rows but incorrectly set every cell in them to 0**, effectively omitting those categories from the distribution.

**How to fix**
- Recompute frequency tables **including missing-value categories** (both “don’t know” and “no answer”) and **do not treat them as 0**.
- Ensure the output table prints those counts per genre exactly as in the True table.

### 2) Column items/categories (missing/extra/wrong genre columns)

**Mismatch: “Opera” column name merged incorrectly**
- In the **True Results (Panel 2)**, there are two separate columns:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- In the **Generated Results**, these appear as one combined header:  
  **“New Age/Space Opera”** (a single column)

**Why this is wrong**
- It collapses two distinct genres into one, losing an entire column and mislabeling the remaining one.

**How to fix**
- Split that combined column into **two separate columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- Then populate each with its own counts:
  - New Age/Space: 48, 186, 269, 429, 368, 292, 14, mean 3.68  
  - Opera: 73, 257, 359, 515, 306, 83, 13, mean 3.48

**Note**
- Aside from this, the *set of genres* should be 18 total, and the True table has 18. The Generated output *appears* to have 18 too, but only because it incorrectly merged “New Age/Space” + “Opera” into one header while still showing 18 labels—so the genre list is effectively wrong.

---

### 3) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

#### A) For all genres: the two “M” rows are wrong (all zeros)
In the **Generated Results**, these are **0 for every genre**:
- (M) Don’t know much about it
- (M) No answer

In the **True Results**, they are **nonzero for every genre**. Examples:

**Panel 1 (examples)**
- Latin/Salsa: Don’t know = **221**, No answer = **12**
- Jazz: Don’t know = **38**, No answer = **15**
- Oldies: Don’t know = **41**, No answer = **10**

**Panel 2 (examples)**
- Reggae: Don’t know = **295**, No answer = **11**
- Swing/Big Band: Don’t know = **164**, No answer = **12**
- New Age/Space: Don’t know = **292**, No answer = **14**
- Opera: Don’t know = **83**, No answer = **13**

**Panel 3 (examples)**
- Pop/Easy Listening: Don’t know = **72**, No answer = **13**
- Rap: Don’t know = **61**, No answer = **11**
- Heavy Metal: Don’t know = **70**, No answer = **10**
- Country/Western: Don’t know = **22**, No answer = **10**

**How to fix**
- When tabulating, explicitly include codes/categories for:
  - “Don’t know much about it”
  - “No answer”
- In many workflows this means using a tabulation option that includes missing categories (or not filtering them out), e.g., *do not drop NA/missing*, and if the GSS uses numeric missing codes, **recode them into labeled categories before tabulation**.

#### B) Non-missing attitude rows (1–5) mostly match the True table
For the 1–5 rows, the **counts shown in Generated Results match the True Results** *for the genres that are correctly defined*.

However, the “New Age/Space Opera” column is misleading:
- The **counts displayed under “New Age/Space Opera” (48, 186, 269, 429, 368)** exactly match **New Age/Space**, not Opera.
- So **Opera’s 1–5 counts are missing entirely** in Generated Results.

**How to fix**
- After splitting the column, ensure Opera gets its proper 1–5 counts:
  - Opera: Like very much 73; Like it 257; Mixed 359; Dislike 515; Dislike very much 306

### 4) Summary statistics mismatches (Means, totals, etc.)

#### A) Means: values shown match the True table, but the underlying distribution used is inconsistent
- The **Mean row values in Generated Results match the True table** for all genres listed.
- But because Generated Results show **0** for the two missing-category rows, the displayed table is internally inconsistent: it implies the mean was computed with no “don’t know/no answer” cases, yet the sample sizes implied by the counts do not match the true distributions.

**What’s going on**
- Likely the mean was computed **excluding missing**, which is standard. That’s fine.
- The problem is the frequency table output incorrectly suggests there were zero missing responses.

**How to fix**
- Keep mean calculation as “valid only” (excluding M categories), **but report missing categories correctly** in the frequency distribution.
- Optionally add:
  - **Valid N** and **Total N** per genre, so it’s clear means are based on valid responses only.

#### B) Totals / N not shown (implicit mismatch risk)
- Neither table prints totals, but with the Generated Results missing the M counts, any computed totals from the displayed rows would be wrong vs. True.

**How to fix**
- If you provide totals, compute:
  - Total N = sum of rows (1–5) + Don’t know + No answer
  - Valid N = sum of rows (1–5)
- Ensure the totals match the True table per genre.

---

### 5) Percentages (not shown) — but if generated elsewhere, they would be wrong
- Your prompt asks to compare percentages, but the **Generated Results provide counts only**.
- If percentages were computed from the Generated table as displayed, they would be **incorrect**, because the denominator would omit “Don’t know” and “No answer.”

**How to fix**
- Decide whether percentages should be:
  - **Percent of total (including M categories)**, or
  - **Valid percent (excluding M categories)**
- Then compute consistently and label them accordingly.

## Concrete correction checklist (so generated matches true)

1. **Split the merged column** “New Age/Space Opera” into:
   - “New Age/Space”
   - “Opera”
2. **Populate “Don’t know much about it” counts** for every genre exactly as in True table.
3. **Populate “No answer” counts** for every genre exactly as in True table.
4. Ensure the **Opera column exists** with all 1–5 + M rows + mean.
5. If you output percentages, compute them using the correct denominator (total or valid) and label them.

If you want, paste the code/output method you used to generate the “Generated Results” and I can tell you exactly what to change (e.g., recodes, missing handling, and column naming).
