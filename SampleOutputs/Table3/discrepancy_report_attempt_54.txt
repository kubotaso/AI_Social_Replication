Score: 65/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: missing rows in the generated table
The generated table **omits two attitude categories entirely** by setting them to zeros across all genres:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
- **(M) No answer**

In the true table, these rows have **nonzero counts for every genre**.

**How to fix:**  
Populate these two rows with the true counts (see section 3 below). Do not treat missing codes as 0; they are valid response categories with frequencies.

---

### 2) Column items/categories: mismatch in a column name/category
The generated header includes:

- **“New Age/Space Opera”** (single combined column label)

But the true table has:

- **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** as **two separate columns** (in Panel 2)

In the generated table, “New Age/Space Opera” appears to be **only one column**, yet the cells under it match the **New Age/Space** counts (e.g., Like very much = 48; Like it = 186; etc.), and there is **no separate Opera column**.

**How to fix:**
- Split this into **two columns**: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.
- Keep the existing counts under “New Age/Space” (they already match).
- Add the missing **Opera** column with its true counts and mean:
  - Like very much 73; Like it 257; Mixed 359; Dislike 515; Dislike very much 306; Don’t know 83; No answer 13; Mean 3.48.

---

### 3) Frequency count mismatches: all errors are in the missing-response rows
For the 5 substantive categories (1)–(5), **all counts match perfectly** across all genres.

The only frequency/count mismatches are that the generated table shows **0** for all genres in the two “M” rows, while the true table has the following nonzero values.

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — should be:
**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### (M) No answer — should be:
**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix:**  
Insert these exact values into the generated table for the two missing-response rows, and ensure the “Opera” column exists.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (means): mostly correct, but one mean is misassigned due to the missing Opera column
- All displayed means in the generated table **match the true means** for the columns that exist (Latin/Salsa through Gospel), **including New Age/Space = 3.68**.

But because the generated table lacks a separate **Opera** column, the generated output is **missing the Opera mean (3.48)** and incorrectly *labels* the “New Age/Space” column as “New Age/Space Opera,” which implies the mean might refer to some combined variable (it does not).

**How to fix:**
- Rename the existing “New Age/Space Opera” column to **New Age/Space** and keep mean **3.68**.
- Add a separate **Opera** column with mean **3.48**.

---

### 5) Percentages: not shown (but would be wrong if computed from the generated table)
The true table gives **counts only** (and means). The generated table also provides counts only.  
However, if you compute percentages from the generated table, they will be **wrong** because the denominators would exclude the nonzero “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts (since they were set to 0).

**How to fix:**
- After restoring the two missing-response rows (and adding Opera), compute percentages using:
  - denominator = sum of **all 7 response categories** (1–5 + Don’t know + No answer) **for each genre**.

---

## Net changes required to make generated match true
1. **Add the missing response-category counts** for:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it
   - (M) No answer
2. **Split “New Age/Space Opera” into two columns**:
   - New Age/Space (keep existing counts/mean)
   - Opera (add missing counts/mean 3.48)
3. If producing percentages, **recompute using the full denominators** including the M categories.
