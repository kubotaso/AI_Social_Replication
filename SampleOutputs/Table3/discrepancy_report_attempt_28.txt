============================================================

## 1) Wrong table/content altogether (major mismatch)
- **Generated Results** are a single wide frequency table for 18 music genres (looks like Table 3 only), with 8 rows (5 attitude rows + 2 NaN rows + mean).
- **True Results** contain **three separate tables**:
  - **Table 1**: OLS regression coefficients (SES/Demographic/Political Intolerance models)
  - **Table 2**: OLS regression coefficients (racism + demographics; two outcomes)
  - **Table 3**: frequency distributions for 18 genres (with *7* non-mean rows per genre + mean)

**How to fix**
- If the task is to reproduce “true results,” your generated output must include **Tables 1 and 2** (regression coefficient tables) in addition to Table 3.
- If you intended to generate only Table 3, label it as Table 3 and **do not present it as the whole “true results.”**

---

## 2) Row items/categories mismatch (Table 3): missing categories shown as NaN
### True Table 3 has these rows (per genre)
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
7. **(M) No answer**  
8. Mean

### Generated table rows
- Rows 1–5 match the five attitude categories.
- Rows 6–7 are **NaN across all columns**, but they should be the two “missing/other” categories:
  - (M) Don’t know much about it
  - (M) No answer
- Mean row is present.

**How to fix**
- Replace the two NaN rows with the correct counts for:
  - **Don’t know much about it**
  - **No answer**
- Ensure the row labels are included (not just numbers).

---

## 3) Frequency counts: all non-missing attitude counts match; missing counts are absent
For the 5 main attitude categories (1)–(5), the **generated counts match the true counts for every genre** (Latin/Salsa through Gospel). There are **no mismatches** in those 5 rows.

What’s wrong is that the generated output **omits** the two additional frequency rows (they are NaN), so the table is incomplete and totals per genre will be wrong if someone sums rows.

### Missing counts that must be inserted (exact values)
You need to add these two rows to match the true table:

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66  
- Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35  

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11  
- Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12  

**How to fix**
- Populate those two missing rows with the above values, and label them correctly.

---

## 4) Percentages columns: missing entirely (if expected)
- The prompt asks to check “frequency counts or percentages.”  
- **True Table 3 provides counts only** (no percentages).
- **Generated Results also provide counts only.**

So there’s **no mismatch** on “percentages” because the true table doesn’t include them.  
**If** your generated analysis elsewhere claimed percentages, then you’d need to compute them consistently (same denominator per genre, typically total N including missing vs excluding missing—must match whatever the “true” method uses). But based on the true Table 3 shown, **counts-only is correct**.

---

## 5) Summary statistics (means): match (minor formatting differences only)
The mean row in Generated Results matches the True Table 3 means for all genres (differences only due to rounding/precision display):

- Example: Latin/Salsa **3.142753** (generated) vs **3.14** (true)
- Jazz **2.60528** vs **2.61**, etc.

**How to fix (optional)**
- Round means to **two decimals** to match the presentation in the true table.

---

## 6) Column/category structure: partially mismatched vs how “true” presents it
- **Generated** puts all 18 genres in one wide header row.
- **True Table 3** splits genres into **three separate subtables** (6 genres each) with headings:
  - “Latin/Salsa; Jazz; …”
  - “Reggae; Swing/Big Band; …”
  - “Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; …”

This is not a numeric mismatch, but it **is a presentation/structure mismatch**.

**How to fix**
- Either:
  1) Split the generated output into the same three subtables (6 columns each), or  
  2) Keep one wide table but clearly indicate it is Table 3 and include the two missing rows.

---

## 7) Missing entire tables (Tables 1 and 2)
If the goal is to match the full “True Results” section, then the generated output is missing:
- **All rows/columns/values in Table 1**
- **All rows/columns/values in Table 2**
Including: variables, coefficients with significance stars, constants, R², adjusted R², number of cases, footnotes.

**How to fix**
- Generate two additional regression tables with exactly the same:
  - row set (variables)
  - column set (models)
  - coefficient values and significance markers
  - fit statistics and N
  - footnotes

### Minimal correction checklist to make Generated Table 3 match True Table 3
1) Replace the two NaN rows with the correct counts for **Don’t know much about it** and **No answer** (values listed above).  
2) Add row labels for all categories including the two missing ones.  
3) Round means to two decimals (optional, for display consistency).  
4) If matching the *entire* true output, also add Tables 1 and 2 (currently completely absent).
