## 1) Row items / categories (names and number of items)

### Mismatch: Missing response rows in the Generated Results
Your generated table shows these rows:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- (M) Don’t know much about it **(present but all zeros)**
- (M) No answer **(present but all zeros)**
- Mean

The **true table has nonzero counts** for both missing-data categories:
- **(M) Don’t know much about it** (nonzero for every genre)
- **(M) No answer** (nonzero for every genre)

So the generated output is not actually “missing rows,” but it is **missing the correct values** for two entire rows (it incorrectly sets them to 0 for all columns).

**How to fix**
- Ensure your frequency procedure includes *all* response codes, including “Don’t know” and “No answer,” instead of treating them as NA/excluded.
- If you recoded these to missing (NA), stop doing that for the frequency table; keep them as explicit categories.
- In tools like R: use `table(x, useNA="ifany")` or ensure factor levels include the M categories.
- In SPSS/Stata: don’t define DK/NA as “user-missing” if you want them counted in the distribution table.

## 2) Column categories (missing/extra columns)

### Mismatch: Incorrect column header “New Age/Space Opera”
- **Generated:** `New Age/Space Opera`
- **True:** `New Age/Space` and **separate column** `Opera`

This is a structural mismatch:
- The generated table **merges two true columns** into one incorrectly named column (“New Age/Space Opera”).
- The true table has **two distinct genres**: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**, each with its own frequency distribution and mean.

**How to fix**
- Split the generated combined column into two separate variables/columns:
  - `New Age/Space`
  - `Opera`
- Also fix the label: it should not be “Space Opera” (a different phrase); it should be **New Age/Space** plus **Opera** as its own genre.

---

## 3) Frequency counts: every mismatch (by row)

### A) Rows (1)–(5): Likes/Dislikes
For the “Like/Dislike” rows (1) through (5), the generated counts **match the true counts** for all genres **except** the column-structure problem noted above (because “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are incorrectly merged in the header in the generated output).

Concretely:
- Panel 1 genres (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber): **(1)–(5) match**
- Panel 2 genres (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, Bluegrass, Folk): **(1)–(5) match**
- Panel 3 genres (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel): **(1)–(5) match**
- For the two genres **New Age/Space** and **Opera**, the generated table *appears* to show two separate columns (because there are two adjacent columns labeled “New Age/Space” and “Opera” in the generated header string), but the header text is wrong (“New Age/Space Opera”), and you must ensure they are truly treated as distinct columns in your code/output.

### B) (M) Don’t know much about it — Generated is wrong everywhere
Generated shows **0 for every genre**, but true counts are:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa: **221**
- Jazz: **38**
- Blues/R&B: **56**
- Show Tunes: **77**
- Oldies: **41**
- Classical/Chamber: **66**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae: **295**
- Swing/Big Band: **164**
- New Age/Space: **292**
- Opera: **83**
- Bluegrass: **163**
- Folk: **78**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72**
- Contemporary Rock: **50**
- Rap: **61**
- Heavy Metal: **70**
- Country/Western: **22**
- Gospel: **35**

**How to fix**
- Same as above: don’t drop DK responses; include them as a category level and count them.

### C) (M) No answer — Generated is wrong everywhere
Generated shows **0 for every genre**, but true counts are:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa: **12**
- Jazz: **15**
- Blues/R&B: **12**
- Show Tunes: **14**
- Oldies: **10**
- Classical/Chamber: **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae: **11**
- Swing/Big Band: **12**
- New Age/Space: **14**
- Opera: **13**
- Bluegrass: **11**
- Folk: **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13**
- Contemporary Rock: **12**
- Rap: **11**
- Heavy Metal: **10**
- Country/Western: **10**
- Gospel: **12**

**How to fix**
- Do not filter out item-nonresponse; keep it as an explicit category for the frequency table.

## 4) Percentages
The generated table provides **counts only**, not percentages.

**Mismatch**
- The user request includes “frequency counts or percentages,” but the true table as shown also only provides counts and means (no percentages). So:
  - There is **no direct percentage mismatch to check** because neither table reports percentages.
  - If your generated analysis was *supposed* to include percentages, then it is missing that output entirely.

**How to fix (if percentages are required)**
- Add a percent-of-total column/row calculation per genre, using the correct denominator:
  - Denominator should include **all response categories** listed in the true table (1–5 plus both M categories), unless the true publication specifies otherwise.

---

## 5) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: appear to match
The **Mean** row in the generated results matches the true table for all listed genres:
- Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, Blues/R&B 2.50, Show Tunes 2.59, Oldies 2.25, Classical/Chamber 2.67
- Reggae 3.15, Swing/Big Band 2.45, New Age/Space 3.68, Opera 3.48, Bluegrass 2.67, Folk 2.76
- Pop/Easy Listening 2.41, Contemporary Rock 2.67, Rap 3.92, Heavy Metal 4.12, Country/Western 2.32, Gospel 2.39

### But there’s a logical inconsistency you should correct
If you truly had **0 DK** and **0 No answer**, the means would generally change (because you’d be changing which cases are included/excluded). The fact that your means match the true table strongly suggests:
- you computed means on the correct base (likely excluding DK/NA or handling them correctly), **but**
- your frequency table incorrectly forced DK/NA to zero (by filtering them out or recoding them away before tabulation).

**How to fix**
- Use the same cleaned/recode rules consistently:
  - If you want the published mean, likely compute the mean on valid 1–5 responses (excluding M categories), **but** still display DK/NA counts in the frequency distribution.
- In practice: create two views:
  1) frequency table including DK/NA categories  
  2) mean computed only on 1–5 valid responses  
  That matches what the true table implies.

## 6) Checklist of required corrections (to make Generated match True)

1. **Replace the all-zero DK row with the true DK counts** for each genre (listed above).
2. **Replace the all-zero No answer row with the true No answer counts** for each genre (listed above).
3. **Fix the column structure/labels**:
   - Ensure **New Age/Space** and **Opera** are separate columns.
   - Rename the header from “New Age/Space Opera” to the two correct genre names.
4. (Optional, if your deliverable expects it) **Add percentages** computed with the correct denominator and clarify whether M categories are included in the denominator.

If you want, paste the code (or tool/workflow) used to produce the generated table and I’ll point to the exact step where DK/NA are being dropped or recoded.
