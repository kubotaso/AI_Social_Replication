Score: 67/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### A. Missing rows in the Generated Results
Your generated table includes these attitude rows:

- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- (M) Don’t know much about it  
- (M) No answer  
- Mean

But the **values for the two “(M)” rows are incorrectly all zeros**, which effectively makes them “missing” in practice (see §2).

### B. Column/category labeling mismatch (structural)
In the **Generated Results header**, you have:

- `New Age/Space Opera` (merged/combined)
  
In the **True Results (Panel 2)**, these are **two separate columns**:

- `New Age/Space`
- `Opera`

**Fix:** Split the generated combined column into **two distinct variables/columns**:
- `New Age/Space`
- `Opera`

Then compute frequencies separately for each.

## 2) Frequency counts mismatches

### A. Rows (M) “Don’t know much about it” and (M) “No answer” are wrong for *every* genre
In the Generated Results, both rows are:

- (M) Don’t know much about it: **0 for all genres**
- (M) No answer: **0 for all genres**

In the True Results, **all genres have non-zero counts** in both missingness categories.

So **every cell in those two rows is a mismatch across all genres**.

#### Correct “Don’t know much about it” counts (True Table)
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### Correct “No answer” counts (True Table)
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Do not recode these missing categories to 0. They are legitimate response categories in the published table. Ensure your tabulation includes them as explicit levels (or, if you treat them as missing in analysis, do not print them as zero—either exclude the row or report correct counts).

---

### B. “New Age/Space Opera” column is necessarily wrong (even if visible counts appear)
Because you **combined two distinct genres (New Age/Space and Opera)** into one column, the generated table cannot match the true one for that part of the table.

What happened is likely:
- Your generated counts under `New Age/Space Opera` appear to match the **New Age/Space** column values (48, 186, 269, 429, 368), **but Opera is missing entirely** as its own column.

So you have two problems:
1) **Opera column is missing**
2) Your combined label is wrong; it should not be merged.

**Fix:** Add an `Opera` column with the true Opera frequencies:
- Like very much 73
- Like it 257
- Mixed feelings 359
- Dislike it 515
- Dislike very much 306
- Don’t know 83
- No answer 13
- Mean 3.48

…and keep New Age/Space separate with its own values.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
All reported means in the Generated Results **match the True Results** *for the columns that exist*, including:
- Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, …, Gospel 2.39
- New Age/Space mean 3.68 is correct for New Age/Space.

However, because:
- you **omitted Opera as a separate column**, you are missing the Opera mean (**3.48**) as its own entry.

So: **no numeric mean discrepancies for shared columns**, but **a missing mean for Opera** due to the missing column.

**Fix:** After splitting `New Age/Space` and `Opera`, compute and report both means separately.

### Totals / denominators (implicit mismatch)
Even though the first five category counts match the true table, your generated table’s “missing” rows are zero. That implies an incorrect total N per genre if anyone sums rows.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total across all response categories = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total implied = 85+325+416+403+144+0+0 = **1373** (wrong)

This same issue occurs for **every genre**.

**Fix:** Include the (M) rows with correct counts (or exclude them and clearly state the reduced base). If you want the table to match the published one, include them.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column
- **Opera** is missing as a standalone genre in the generated table.

### Extra/incorrect column label
- `New Age/Space Opera` is an incorrect merged label/category.

**Fix:** Replace `New Age/Space Opera` with two columns:
- `New Age/Space`
- `Opera`

---

## What is already correct
- For all genres that are present, the **(1)–(5)** frequency counts match the True Results exactly.
- Means match for those same genres.

---

## Minimal set of changes to make Generated match True
1) **Split the combined column** into `New Age/Space` and `Opera` (add Opera back).
2) Replace the zero-filled (M) rows with the **true non-zero counts** for:
   - “Don’t know much about it”
   - “No answer”
3) (Optional but recommended) Ensure row/column labels exactly match the true table (especially `New Age/Space` and `Opera`), and verify totals per genre if you report Ns or percentages.

If you paste the code you used to generate the table (R/Stata/SPSS/Python), I can point to the exact place where missing categories were dropped/recoded and show the precise correction.
