Score: 72/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: missing rows in the generated table

**Mismatch:** The generated results include the attitude rows *(1)–(5)* and **Mean**, but they incorrectly show **zeroes** for the two “missing-data” categories:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it** → generated: all 0  
- **(M) No answer** → generated: all 0  

**True table:** Both of these rows have **nonzero counts for every genre** (and they differ by genre).

**Fix:** Populate those two rows with the true counts (see sections 2–3 below). Do **not** force them to zero.

---

### 2) Frequency counts: every “(M) Don’t know much about it” value is wrong

In the generated table, the entire row is zeros; in the true table it is:

**Panel 1 genres**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 genres**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 genres**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix:** Replace the generated row of zeros with these counts.

---

### 3) Frequency counts: every “(M) No answer” value is wrong

Again the generated table has all zeros; the true table is:

**Panel 1 genres**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2 genres**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3 genres**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the generated row of zeros with these counts.

---

### 4) Column categories / headers: one label mismatch (“New Age/Space Opera”)

**Mismatch:** The generated header combines two separate true headers into one:

- Generated: **“New Age/Space Opera”** (looks like one column name)
- True: **two distinct columns**: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**

**Why it matters:** In the true results, **New Age/Space** and **Opera** have different distributions and different means (3.68 vs 3.48). Your generated table *does* show two numeric columns after Swing/Big Band (values align with New Age/Space and Opera), but the header text incorrectly fuses them.

**Fix:** Split/rename the headers so they match the true table:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

(If your output format needs unique names, use exactly those labels.)

---

### 5) Other frequency rows (1)–(5): appear to match

For the substantive response categories:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  

…the generated counts match the true table **for all genres** (no discrepancies found), aside from the header label issue noted above.

---

### 6) Summary statistics (Means): match, but are inconsistent with the (M) rows you reported

**Observation:** The generated **Mean** row matches the true mean values for all genres.

**But discrepancy in logic:** If you truly had **0** “Don’t know” and **0** “No answer,” the means would generally **not** match the true table (because those missing categories affect the denominator / coding treatment depending on how means are computed). So the means matching strongly suggests the underlying computation used the correct data, but the missing rows were wrongly overwritten to zero at presentation time.

**Fix:** Keep the mean values as they are (they match), but ensure the missing rows are correctly displayed (sections 2–3). Also ensure your mean calculation procedure matches the true table’s rule (almost certainly: compute mean over valid responses 1–5, excluding M categories).

---

## What to change so the generated table matches the true one

1. **Replace the two missing-data rows** with the true counts (sections 2 and 3).
2. **Correct the column header(s):** change “New Age/Space Opera” to **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera” (or at minimum, label them distinctly).
3. Leave all other category counts and the **Mean** row as-is (they already match the true table).
