Score: 69/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: **missing rows in the generated table**
Your generated output only includes 5 attitude categories plus a mean row, and it has **two rows of NaN** where real categories should be.

**True Table 3 has 8 rows per genre:**
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  ← missing in generated
7. **(M) No answer**  ← missing in generated
8. Mean

**Generated table instead has:**
- Rows 1–5: the five attitude categories (correct values)
- Rows 6–7: `NaN` (incorrect; should be the two “M” rows)
- Row 8: Mean (correct values)

**How to fix**
- Add two explicit rows for **“Don’t know much about it”** and **“No answer”**.
- Populate them with the correct counts (see Section 2 below).
- Remove the NaN rows (or replace them with those categories).

---

### 2) Frequency counts: **all “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts are missing**
For every genre column, the generated table shows **NaN** for those two missing-response categories, while the true table provides real counts.

Below are the exact values that must replace the NaNs.

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — true counts to insert
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### (M) No answer — true counts to insert
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- When generating the frequency table, make sure missing-response categories are not dropped. In many tools this means:
  - treating “Don’t know” and “No answer” as explicit factor levels (not NA), or
  - computing counts with missing categories included (e.g., include NA separately, or recode those responses to labeled categories).

---

### 3) Frequency counts for the five main attitude categories: **no mismatches found**
For rows (1) through (5), the generated counts match the true table for all 18 genres (e.g., Latin/Salsa 85/325/416/403/144; Jazz 254/540/393/297/69; etc.). I see **no discrepancies** in those five-category counts.

---

### 4) Percentages: **missing entirely in the generated output**
You asked to compare “frequency counts or percentages.” The **true table only reports counts (not percentages)**, and your generated output also has only counts (plus mean). So there’s no percentage mismatch—but if your generated analysis was *supposed* to include percentages, that’s an omission.

**How to fix (if percentages are required)**
- Add percent columns or a second table with column-wise percentages, using an appropriate denominator:
  - Usually denominator = total responses including M categories, unless the original table specifies excluding missing.

---

### 5) Summary statistics (Means): **match (minor rounding differences only)**
Generated mean row values align with the true table’s means:

- Latin/Salsa **3.142753 → 3.14** (rounding)
- Jazz **2.60528 → 2.61**
- Blues/R&B **2.5 → 2.50**
- Show Tunes **2.594059 → 2.59**
- Oldies **2.246302 → 2.25**
- Classical/Chamber **2.669719 → 2.67**
- Reggae **3.154615 → 3.15**
- Swing/Big Band **2.447552 → 2.45**
- New Age/Space **3.679231 → 3.68**
- Opera **3.47947 → 3.48**
- Bluegrass **2.665503 → 2.67**
- Folk **2.759235 → 2.76**
- Pop/Easy Listening **2.406969 → 2.41**
- Contemporary Rock **2.670984 → 2.67**
- Rap **3.921773 → 3.92**
- Heavy Metal **4.122543 → 4.12**
- Country/Western **2.324651 → 2.32**
- Gospel **2.394484 → 2.39**

**How to fix (presentation)**
- Round means to 2 decimals to match the true table formatting.

---

### 6) Column categories: **no missing or extra genre columns**
All 18 genre columns in the generated output match the true Table 3 list:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No extra or missing genre columns.

## Bottom line: what must be corrected
1. **Replace the two NaN rows with the two missing-response categories**:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it
   - (M) No answer
2. **Fill in the exact counts** for those rows (listed above).
3. Optionally **round mean values** to 2 decimals to match the published formatting.
4. If your spec expects percentages, **add them** (the true table doesn’t show them, but your requirement might).

If you tell me what software/code produced the “Generated Results” (R `table()`, pandas `value_counts()`, etc.), I can tell you the precise change needed to keep those “M” categories from being dropped.
