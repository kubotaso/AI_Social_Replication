Score: 75/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/extra rows)

### A. Missing “Don’t know much about it” row (all genres)
- **Generated table:** shows two all-zero rows between “Dislike very much” and “Mean”.
- **True table:** has **two nonzero missing-data rows**:
  1. **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  2. **(M) No answer**

**How to fix**
- Replace the **first all-zero row** with the true **“Don’t know much about it”** counts (by genre).
- Replace the **second all-zero row** with the true **“No answer”** counts (by genre).
- Label these rows explicitly. Do not leave them as unlabeled/zero.

### B. Row labels are missing in the generated output
- **Generated:** only numbers; no explicit row names for (1)–(5), (M), Mean.
- **True:** rows are explicitly labeled: Like very much, Like it, Mixed feelings, Dislike it, Dislike very much, Don’t know, No answer, Mean.

**How to fix**
- Add row labels in the generated table so it is clear which row corresponds to which attitude category.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

### All “attitude” categories (1)–(5): MATCH
For every genre, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
**match the true table exactly.**

### Missing-data categories: MISMATCH (all genres)
In the generated table, both missing-data rows are **0 for every genre**, but the true table has nonzero counts.

Below are the true values you must insert.

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — true counts (generated currently has 0s)
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### (M) No answer — true counts (generated currently has 0s)
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- Populate these two rows with the above counts; remove the all-zero rows.

---

## 3) Percentages: cannot be verified / missing entirely
- **Generated results:** provide **counts** (and means), but **no percentages**.
- **True table:** also shows **counts** (and means), not percentages.

So:
- There are **no percentage mismatches** to flag.
- If your generated analysis was *supposed* to include percentages, that’s a separate omission: you’d need to compute them using the correct denominator (typically total N per genre, including missing categories, unless specified otherwise).

**How to fix (if percentages are required)**
- Compute % for each row within each genre using:  
  \[
  \% = \frac{\text{row count}}{\text{sum of all 7 categories for that genre}} \times 100
  \]
- Make sure the denominator includes “Don’t know” and “No answer” if you want percentages of all respondents.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: MATCH (with minor rounding)
Generated “Mean” row matches the true means for all genres (differences only reflect formatting/precision), e.g.:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ **3.14**
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ **2.61**
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ **4.12**
etc.

### Totals / N per genre: implied mismatch due to missing rows
Because the generated table sets missing categories to zero, any computed **total N** per genre from the generated table will be **too small** compared to the true data.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- Generated total (only 1–5): 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True total (including missing): 1373 + 221 + 12 = **1606**

**How to fix**
- After inserting the correct missing-category counts, recompute any totals, valid-N, and any derived statistics that depend on N.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns (genre names): MATCH
- Generated includes all **18 genres** present in the true Table 3.
- No extra genres and none missing.

### But: the “True Results” also contain Tables 1–2 (regression tables)
- The generated output corresponds only to **Table 3 frequency distributions + mean**.
- It does **not** reproduce Tables 1–2 at all.

**How to fix (only if your “generated analysis” was supposed to match the entire “True Results”)**
- Generate separate outputs for:
  - Table 1 regression coefficients (SES/Demographic/Political intolerance models)
  - Table 2 regression coefficients (two outcomes)
  - Table 3 frequency distributions
- Right now, the generated output is only attempting Table 3.

---

## Bottom line: what’s wrong and the concrete correction
1. **Replace the two all-zero rows** with the true counts for:
   - **Don’t know much about it**
   - **No answer**
2. **Add row labels** so categories are identifiable.
3. If you compute totals/percentages anywhere, **recompute them after fixing missing rows** (your Ns are currently understated).
