Score: 62/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/extra rows)

### Missing rows in the **Generated Results**
Your generated table includes rows for response options (1)–(5) and then shows **two rows of all zeros**, which appear to be placeholders for missing-data categories. In the **true table**, those two rows are *not zero*; they are:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it** (nonzero counts for every genre)
- **(M) No answer** (nonzero counts for every genre)

So the generated output is missing both missing-data rows’ *actual values* and incorrectly reports them as all zeros.

**How to fix**
- Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts for every genre (see Section 2).

### Row naming
The generated table does not label the rows at all (it’s just numbers), while the true table has explicit row labels. Even if counts were correct, this creates ambiguity.

**How to fix**
- Add row labels exactly matching the true table:  
  (1) Like very much; (2) Like it; (3) Mixed feelings; (4) Dislike it; (5) Dislike very much; (M) Don’t know much about it; (M) No answer; Mean.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches

### Rows (1)–(5): counts match
For all 18 genres, the generated counts for categories **(1)–(5)** match the true table values (e.g., Latin/Salsa 85/325/416/403/144, etc.). No discrepancies found there.

### Missing-data rows: generated is wrong (all zeros)
In the generated output, both missing-data rows are **0 across all columns**. In the true table, they are nonzero for every genre. This is the major mismatch.

Below are the **correct values** you must insert.

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
- **Don’t know much about it:** 221, 38, 56, 77, 41, 66  
- **No answer:** 12, 15, 12, 14, 10, 11  

#### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
- **Don’t know much about it:** 295, 164, 292, 83, 163, 78  
- **No answer:** 11, 12, 14, 13, 11, 12  

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
- **Don’t know much about it:** 72, 50, 61, 70, 22, 35  
- **No answer:** 13, 12, 11, 10, 10, 12  

**How to fix**
- Ensure your tabulation includes missing/non-substantive responses rather than dropping them or defaulting them to zero.
- In code terms: do **not** filter them out before counting; treat them as explicit categories.

## 3) Percentages
Neither the generated nor the true output shows percentages—counts only. So:
- **No percentage mismatches can be checked** because percentages are absent in both.

**How to fix (if percentages are desired)**
- Add a column/row of percentages computed on a clearly defined denominator:
  - Either **including** missing categories (total N per genre),
  - or **excluding** missing categories (valid-percent).  
  But then the table must state which was used.

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: match
The generated mean row matches the true table for all genres:
- Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Gospel 2.39, etc. No discrepancies found.

### Totals / N not shown
The true table does not show totals per genre; generated also doesn’t. However, your generated table implicitly mishandles totals because it sets missing rows to zero.

To illustrate the impact: for **Latin/Salsa**, the true total N across all categories is:
- 85+325+416+403+144 + 221 + 12 = **1606**
Your generated output would sum only the first five rows (because missing rows are 0):
- 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
So even though the means match, the **distribution and N** are wrong in the generated output.

**How to fix**
- Correct the missing rows; optionally add a “Total N” row per genre as a validation check.

## 5) Missing or extra column categories (genre columns)

### Column set: matches, with one labeling nuance
All 18 genres appear in the generated output, matching the true table’s genres.

However, there is a **labeling mismatch risk**:
- True table splits “New Age/Space” and “Opera” into two separate columns (“New Age/Space” and “Opera”).
- Generated header shows: **“New Age/Space Opera”** which could be interpreted as *one combined column label* (“New Age/Space Opera”) rather than two columns (“New Age/Space” and “Opera”).

The numbers that follow indicate they *are* two separate columns (48 then 73 in the first row, matching New Age/Space=48 and Opera=73), so it’s mainly a **format/header parsing problem**, not a numeric one.

**How to fix**
- Ensure the header clearly separates these into two columns:
  - “New Age/Space” and “Opera”
- Use a delimiter (tabs/commas) or a structured table format so column boundaries are unambiguous.

# Bottom line (every mismatch)
1) **Two entire rows are wrong**: “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” are incorrectly shown as all zeros for every genre.  
2) **Row labels are missing** (structural mismatch).  
3) **Potential column header ambiguity**: “New Age/Space Opera” should be split into “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.

Fixing those will make the generated analysis align with the true table.
