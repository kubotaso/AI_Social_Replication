Score: 72/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

**Mismatch: missing “(M) No answer” counts in Generated Results**
- In the *generated* table, the row **“(M) No answer” is present but all zeros** for every genre.
- In the *true* table, **“(M) No answer” has nonzero counts for every genre** (ranging roughly 10–15 depending on genre).

**Fix**
- Replace the generated “(M) No answer” row of zeros with the true per-genre counts (listed below in section 2).

**Potential label/structural mismatch: “New Age/Space Opera”**
- Generated column header: **“New Age/Space Opera”**
- True table splits this as **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** as *two separate columns* in Panel 2.
- However, your generated table clearly has **two separate columns** too: one labeled “New Age/Space” and another labeled “Opera” (the header line appears to merge them into “New Age/Space Opera” due to formatting/wrapping).
  
**Fix**
- Ensure the headers are clearly separated into **two columns**:  
  - `New Age/Space`  
  - `Opera`  
- Do **not** combine them into one “New Age/Space Opera” genre.

No other row-category names are wrong: the attitude categories (1)–(5) and the “Don’t know much about it” row match the true table labels.

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/genre)

All values for response categories (1)–(5) **match perfectly** between generated and true tables for all genres.

All **mismatches are in the (M) rows**:

#### A) (M) Don’t know much about it — mismatches

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa … Classical/Chamber)**
- Latin/Salsa: Generated **233** vs True **221** (should be 221)
- Jazz: **53** vs **38**
- Blues/R&B: **68** vs **56**
- Show Tunes: **91** vs **77**
- Oldies: **51** vs **41**
- Classical/Chamber: **77** vs **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae … Folk)**
- Reggae: **306** vs **295**
- Swing/Big Band: **176** vs **164**
- New Age/Space: **306** vs **292**
- Opera: **96** vs **83**
- Bluegrass: **174** vs **163**
- Folk: **90** vs **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening … Gospel)**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **85** vs **72**
- Contemporary Rock: **62** vs **50**
- Rap: **72** vs **61**
- Heavy Metal: **80** vs **70**
- Country/Western: **32** vs **22**
- Gospel: **47** vs **35**

**Pattern/explanation**
- The generated “Don’t know” counts are consistently **too high**—and the amount they’re too high by is exactly what “No answer” should have been in most cases (see below). This suggests the generated process **accidentally added “No answer” cases into “Don’t know much about it.”**

**Fix**
- For each genre, set “Don’t know much about it” to the true count (above), **and** add the missing “No answer” counts as their own row (next section).

#### B) (M) No answer — mismatches

Generated shows **0 for all**, but true values are:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix**
- Populate the “(M) No answer” row with these values (do not leave as zeros).

---

### 3) Percentages
Neither table displays percentages—only counts and means—so there are **no percentage mismatches to enumerate**. If your generated output was supposed to include percentages, that would be a separate omission (extra required column), but it is not present in the “True Results” provided.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (Means)

**Means match perfectly** for every genre:
- Panel 1 means (3.14, 2.61, 2.50, 2.59, 2.25, 2.67) match.
- Panel 2 means (3.15, 2.45, 3.68, 3.48, 2.67, 2.76) match.
- Panel 3 means (2.41, 2.67, 3.92, 4.12, 2.32, 2.39) match.

**Important note**
- It is *internally inconsistent* that means match while the missing-category handling is wrong, unless:
  1) the mean was computed using only categories (1)–(5) and excluded both (M) categories, **or**
  2) the mean values were copied from the true table rather than recomputed from the generated counts.
  
**Fix (if recomputing means)**
- Compute means using the **same rule as the true table** (very likely: mean of 1–5 responses only, excluding both “Don’t know” and “No answer”).  
- Then it’s fine that means don’t change when you fix (M) rows—*but your (M) counts still must match the true table.*

---

### 5) Missing/extra column categories

- **No genres are missing** (18 genres appear).
- **No extra genres** are present.
- The only column issue is **header clarity** around “New Age/Space” vs “Opera” (should be two distinct columns, not a merged label).

---

## What to change so Generated matches True (exact edits)

1) Replace the generated **“(M) Don’t know much about it”** row with the true counts for each genre (as listed above).
2) Replace the generated **“(M) No answer”** row of zeros with the true nonzero counts (as listed above).
3) Ensure the column headers clearly separate **New Age/Space** and **Opera** into two columns.

That will make every cell match the true tables (counts + means + categories).
