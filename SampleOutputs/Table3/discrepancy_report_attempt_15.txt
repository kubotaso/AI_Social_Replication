Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing rows in the generated table

### What the true table has
Each genre has **8 rows**:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

### What the generated table has
It has the first **5 attitude rows**, then shows **two rows of all zeros**, then a **Mean** row:

- Row 6: all **0.000000** (but should be “Don’t know much about it” counts)
- Row 7: all **0.000000** (but should be “No answer” counts)

### How to fix
Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct missing-data counts from the true table:

**(M) Don’t know much about it** (should be inserted as row 6):

- Latin/Salsa 221
- Jazz 38
- Blues/R&B 56
- Show Tunes 77
- Oldies 41
- Classical/Chamber 66
- Reggae 295
- Swing/Big Band 164
- New Age/Space 292
- Opera 83
- Bluegrass 163
- Folk 78
- Pop/Easy Listening 72
- Contemporary Rock 50
- Rap 61
- Heavy Metal 70
- Country/Western 22
- Gospel 35

**(M) No answer** (should be inserted as row 7):

- Latin/Salsa 12
- Jazz 15
- Blues/R&B 12
- Show Tunes 14
- Oldies 10
- Classical/Chamber 11
- Reggae 11
- Swing/Big Band 12
- New Age/Space 14
- Opera 13
- Bluegrass 11
- Folk 12
- Pop/Easy Listening 13
- Contemporary Rock 12
- Rap 11
- Heavy Metal 10
- Country/Western 10
- Gospel 12

## 2) Frequency counts: mismatches

### Counts for attitude categories (1)–(5)
For every genre, the generated counts for:
- Like very much
- Like it
- Mixed feelings
- Dislike it
- Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly**.

### Counts for missing categories (M)
These **do not match** because the generated table incorrectly lists them as zeros.

- Generated: “Don’t know much about it” = 0 for all genres (wrong)
- Generated: “No answer” = 0 for all genres (wrong)

**Fix**: insert the correct values listed in section 1.

---

## 3) Percentages
The true table shown provides **counts only**, not percentages.

- Generated table: also provides **counts only** (plus means).
- So there are **no percentage mismatches to check**, but if your generated analysis *claimed* percentages, they are not verifiable from what you provided.

**If you need percentages**, you must compute them using the correct denominator (see next section on totals), *and include the missing-data categories if the true-table denominator includes them*.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The generated mean row matches the true means (allowing rounding):

- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ 3.14
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ 2.61
- Blues/R&B 2.5 = 2.50
- Show Tunes 2.594059 ≈ 2.59
- Oldies 2.246302 ≈ 2.25
- Classical/Chamber 2.669719 ≈ 2.67
- Reggae 3.154615 ≈ 3.15
- Swing/Big Band 2.447552 ≈ 2.45
- New Age/Space 3.679231 ≈ 3.68
- Opera 3.47947 ≈ 3.48
- Bluegrass 2.665503 ≈ 2.67
- Folk 2.759235 ≈ 2.76
- Pop/Easy Listening 2.406969 ≈ 2.41
- Contemporary Rock 2.670984 ≈ 2.67
- Rap 3.921773 ≈ 3.92
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ 4.12
- Country/Western 2.324651 ≈ 2.32
- Gospel 2.394484 ≈ 2.39

So **means are correct**.

### Totals / N (implicit check)
Even though totals aren’t displayed, the **zeros in the missing rows imply an incorrect total N per genre** if anyone sums rows.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total = 85+325+416+403+144 +221+12 = **1606**
- Generated (if summed) = same first five (=1373) + 0 + 0 = **1373** → wrong.

**Fix**: include the missing rows so any totals, Ns, and any percentage computations use the correct counts.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns (genres)
The generated table includes all **18 genres** exactly as in the true frequency table:

Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber; Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk; Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel.

No extra genres, none missing.

### Row labels (problem)
The generated table provides **no row labels**, and the final two pre-mean rows are zeros. This is effectively a **missing category labeling/contents error**.

**Fix**: add explicit row labels and populate the two “M” categories with the true counts.

---

## Bottom line: every mismatch and the correction
1. **Mismatch:** “Don’t know much about it” row is all zeros.  
   **Correction:** replace with the true counts (221, 38, 56, …, 35).

2. **Mismatch:** “No answer” row is all zeros.  
   **Correction:** replace with the true counts (12, 15, 12, …, 12).

Everything else (genres, the 1–5 category counts, and means) matches the true table.
