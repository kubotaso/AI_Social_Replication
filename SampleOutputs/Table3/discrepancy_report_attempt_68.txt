Score: 66/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

**Mismatch: Generated table is missing two attitude rows entirely (but still lists them with zeros).**  
- In the **true table**, every genre has **7 response categories** before the Mean:
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
  7. **(M) No answer**  
  Then Mean.
- In the **generated table**, rows 6 and 7 appear but are filled with **0 for every genre**, which is incorrect.

**How to fix:** Populate the two missing-response rows with the correct counts from the true table (listed in Section 2 below). Do not force them to zero.

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/genre)

All “(1) Like very much” through “(5) Dislike very much” counts **match perfectly** between generated and true tables for every genre.

**The only frequency mismatches are the two “M” rows, which are all zeros in the generated results but nonzero in the true table.**

#### A) (M) Don’t know much about it — generated = 0 everywhere, true ≠ 0
Replace the generated zeros with these true counts:

**Panel 1 (Latin → Classical/Chamber)**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae → Folk)**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening → Gospel)**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### B) (M) No answer — generated = 0 everywhere, true ≠ 0
Replace the generated zeros with these true counts:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

### 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means: No mismatches found.**  
Every mean shown in the generated output matches the true table (e.g., Latin 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Heavy Metal 4.12, etc.).

**However, the generated output is internally inconsistent** because it reports **nonzero means** while claiming **0** “Don’t know” and **0** “No answer.” If you recomputed means from only the 5 like/dislike categories, they would generally differ from the published means (which are based on valid responses and/or a defined handling of missing categories). So even though the mean *values* match, the **supporting frequency distribution does not**.

**How to fix:** After inserting the correct missing-category counts, keep the means as shown (since they already match). If your analysis pipeline recomputes means from the frequency table, ensure it uses the same rule as the source table (typically excluding “M” categories from the numeric mean).

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories (genres)

**No missing/extra genres:** both have 18 genres and the same genre set.

**But there is a column-header discrepancy in naming/structure:**
- The true table splits **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** into **two separate columns**.
- The generated header shows **“New Age/Space Opera”** as if it were **one combined genre label**, even though the data underneath correspond to **two separate genres** in the true table:
  - New Age/Space counts (e.g., Like very much = 48, Like it = 186, …)
  - Opera counts (e.g., Like very much = 73, Like it = 257, …)

In the generated output, those two columns appear adjacent, but the header formatting makes it look like one merged label.

**How to fix:** Correct the headers so they are two distinct columns:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

(Keep the associated counts as they already match the true table.)

## Complete list of mismatches (exhaustive)

1) **Row-category counts incorrect for every genre** in:
- (M) Don’t know much about it (should be nonzero; generated shows 0)
- (M) No answer (should be nonzero; generated shows 0)

2) **Column header labeling issue:**
- “New Age/Space Opera” should be split into **two columns: “New Age/Space” and “Opera.”**

Everything else (the five main attitude-category counts and all means) matches the true table.
