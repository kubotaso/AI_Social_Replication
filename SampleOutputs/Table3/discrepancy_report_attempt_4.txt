============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names/number of items)

### A. Missing attitude rows in the Generated Results
The **true Table 3** has **8 rows** per genre block:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

The **generated table shows 8 numeric rows**, but rows 6 and 7 are **all zeros** across every genre. That means the generated output **omitted the real “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts** and replaced them with zeros.

**How to fix:**
- Add the two missing rows and populate them with the correct counts from the true table (see Section 2).
- Ensure the row labels are included (right now the generated output has unlabeled rows, which is also a structural issue).

### B. True results include extra tables not represented at all
The “True Results” include **Table 1 and Table 2 (regression coefficient tables)** in addition to Table 3. The generated output only corresponds to something like Table 3 frequencies/means and **does not include Tables 1–2 at all**.

**How to fix:**
- If the task is to reproduce the full “True Results,” you must generate **three tables** (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3).  
- If only Table 3 is intended, then the “generated results” should explicitly state it is **Table 3 only** and not presented as matching the full true output.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

All frequencies for rows (1) through (5) match the true table (for every genre).  
The **only frequency mismatches** are the two missing “M” rows, which are incorrectly shown as **0** for every genre.

Below are the correct values that should replace the generated zeros.

### Replace Generated Row 6 (all zeros) with: **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

### Replace Generated Row 7 (all zeros) with: **(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

## 3) Percentages mismatches

The **true table provides counts only (no percentages shown)**.  
The generated output also provides **counts only**, so there are **no percentage mismatches to check**.

However, if you intended to compute percentages, the generated output is missing them entirely.

**How to fix (if percentages are required):**
- Add percent columns for each genre/row using the correct denominator (typically total valid + missing, depending on definition).
- Be explicit whether “Don’t know” and “No answer” are included in the denominator.

## 4) Summary statistic mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### A. Means match (within rounding)
The generated mean row values match the true means to rounding precision (e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ 3.14; Jazz 2.60528 ≈ 2.61; etc.). No correction needed there.

### B. But the means are inconsistent with the generated missing rows
Even though the means match the true table, the generated table shows **0** “Don’t know” and “No answer.” If someone recomputed means from the generated counts, the implied N would be wrong and the mean would generally not reconcile with the displayed frequencies.

**How to fix:**
- Populate the missing “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” rows with the correct counts (Section 2). Then the displayed mean is coherent with the full distribution.

### C. Totals / Ns are not shown
The true table doesn’t show totals either, so this is not a mismatch—but it’s a common check that would reveal the problem immediately (the generated table’s totals would be too small).

**How to fix (recommended):**
- Add a “Total” row per genre, or at least verify each genre sums to the expected N.

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### A. Column set matches Table 3 genres
The generated columns include exactly the 18 genres shown in the true Table 3:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

So there are **no missing/extra genre columns** relative to Table 3.

### B. But the true output includes additional tables/columns (Tables 1–2)
If “true results” means the entire excerpt (Tables 1–3), then the generated output is missing:
- Table 1 columns: SES Model, Demographic Model, Political Intolerance Model
- Table 2 columns: two dependent-variable specifications

**How to fix:**
- Generate those regression tables separately with the correct coefficients, constants, R², adjusted R², and case counts.

## Minimal correction summary (to make Generated match True Table 3)
1. **Replace the two all-zero rows** with the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts (listed above).
2. **Add row labels** for all 8 rows so the categories are explicit and match the true table.
3. (Optional but recommended) Add a **Total N** row per genre as a validation check.

If you want, paste your code/output format requirements (wide vs. long; pandas vs. R) and I can show the corrected table in the same structure as your generated output.
