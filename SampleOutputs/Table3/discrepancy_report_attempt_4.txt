============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### A. Missing rows in the generated table
Your generated output includes the 5 substantive attitude categories (1)–(5), then shows **two rows of all zeros**, then the Mean row. In the true table, those two rows are **not zeros**; they are two distinct missing-data categories:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

So the generated table is **missing both “M” rows’ values** for all 18 genres (they were replaced with 0s).

**Fix:** Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” frequency rows (see section 2 for exact values).

### B. Column/category naming mismatch
In the generated header you have: **“New Age/Space Opera”** as one combined label. In the true table, this is actually **two columns**:

- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

In your generated results you *do* have two separate columns of numbers after Swing/Big Band (one for New Age/Space and one for Opera), but the header text incorrectly merges them into one label (“New Age/Space Opera”), which makes the table structurally ambiguous/mis-labeled.

**Fix:** Split/rename headers to match the true table exactly:
- “New Age/Space”
- “Opera”

Everything else in the column list appears present (18 genres), but this header issue is a real mismatch.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

### Key problem: all missing-data frequencies are wrong (set to zero)
For **every genre**, the generated table reports:

- (M) Don’t know much about it = **0**
- (M) No answer = **0**

But the true table has nonzero counts for both rows across all genres.

**Fix:** Insert the true values below.

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

### Are any of the (1)–(5) category counts wrong?
Comparing your generated counts for rows (1)–(5) against the true table: **they match for all 18 genres**. The only frequency-count errors are the two missing-data rows (and the header labeling issue noted above).

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
Your generated mean row:
- Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, Blues/R&B 2.50, Show Tunes 2.59, Oldies 2.25, Classical/Chamber 2.67,
- Reggae 3.15, Swing/Big Band 2.45, New Age/Space 3.68, Opera 3.48, Bluegrass 2.67, Folk 2.76,
- Pop/Easy Listening 2.41, Contemporary Rock 2.67, Rap 3.92, Heavy Metal 4.12, Country/Western 2.32, Gospel 2.39

These **match the true table exactly**.

### But: if you compute totals/percents, your generated table would be inconsistent
Even though the means match, setting the missing rows to zero will make:
- total N by genre too small (missing cases dropped),
- any derived percentages wrong.

**Fix:** Add the two missing-data rows with their true counts before computing any totals/percents.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### A. “New Age/Space” and “Opera” labeling problem
As noted, the generated output’s header text merges them (“New Age/Space Opera”), while the data behave like two columns.

**Fix:** Correct the column headings so there are **18 clearly named genres**, with “New Age/Space” and “Opera” separated.

### B. Panels vs one wide table
The true results are presented as 3 panels of 6 genres each, but that’s just formatting. Your wide format is fine **as long as** headers align unambiguously and all rows are included.

---

## What to change so generated analysis matches the true table (checklist)

1. **Replace the two all-zero rows** with:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it” (use the 18 correct counts)
   - “(M) No answer” (use the 18 correct counts)
2. **Fix the header**:
   - change “New Age/Space Opera” into two headers: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**
3. If you report **percentages**, recompute them using totals that include the M categories (or explicitly state whether percents exclude missing—your current generated output implicitly excludes them by setting them to 0, which is wrong).

Those are all discrepancies; everything else (the (1)–(5) counts and the means) matches the true table.
