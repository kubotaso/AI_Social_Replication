Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing response categories in **Generated Results**
Your generated table includes these rows:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- (M) Don’t know much about it  
- (M) No answer  
- Mean  

This matches the *types* of rows in the True table, **but the values in two of the rows are wrong** (see below). So: **no row-name is missing**, but the “Don’t know much about it” row is effectively missing because it is all zeros.

### B. Column/category naming mismatch (important)
In the generated header you have a single combined label:

- **“New Age/Space Opera”**

In the True table, these are **two separate columns**:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

**How to fix:**
- Split “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.
- Put the New Age/Space counts under “New Age/Space” and Opera counts under “Opera” (they are currently present but merged under one combined header).

*(Note: despite the merged header, your generated counts for “New Age/Space” and “Opera” appear in the right positions as separate numeric columns—i.e., you have 18 genre columns worth of numbers, but one header label incorrectly fuses two of them.)*

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

### Row: **(M) Don’t know much about it**
Generated shows **0 for every genre**.
True table shows **nonzero counts for every genre**.

Here are the true “Don’t know much about it” counts (all should replace the zeros):

- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**How to fix:**
- Your code/output is almost certainly treating this response option as missing/NA and dropping it, then printing a placeholder 0 row.
- Recode and tabulate using the *original GSS category* for “Don’t know much about it” (it is a valid response category, not NA).
- Ensure your frequency table includes **all factor levels**, not just observed-after-filtering levels (e.g., in R: keep factor levels; in pandas: `dropna=False` and categorical with fixed categories; in Stata: don’t recode DK to missing).

---

### Row: **(M) No answer**
Generated “No answer” counts are much larger (dozens to hundreds) than true counts (≈10–15 each). Example:

- Latin/Salsa: generated **233** vs true **12**
- Jazz: **53** vs **15**
- Classical/Chamber: **306** vs **11**
- Swing/Big Band: **176** vs **12**
- New Age/Space: **306** vs **14**
- Country/Western: **32** vs **10**
…and so on for every genre.

**What this implies:**
You have almost certainly **dumped multiple kinds of missingness into “No answer”**, especially the “Don’t know much about it” responses (and possibly other missing codes like “IAP/Not asked”, “DK”, “Not applicable”, etc.).

**How to fix:**
- Separate:
  1) “Don’t know much about it” (a substantive category)
  2) “No answer” (true nonresponse)
  3) Any other system missings / not asked / invalid codes
- Only the true “No answer” should be counted in the “(M) No answer” row; everything else must be handled explicitly (either excluded or reported separately, depending on the original table’s rules).

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (Means)

### Means in your generated table match the True table
All reported means align exactly with the True table (e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Heavy Metal 4.12, etc.).

**But there is a logical inconsistency to fix:**
If you correct the missing rows (“Don’t know much…” and “No answer”), the means should still match **only if** the mean is computed using the same rule as the True table—almost certainly:
- mean computed on responses **1–5 only**, excluding both M categories.

**How to fix (to keep means consistent):**
- Compute mean using only valid scale responses 1–5.
- Do **not** include “Don’t know much…” or “No answer” in the mean denominator.
- After fixing the M rows, re-check means; if they change, your mean calculation currently includes/excludes categories incorrectly.

---

## 4) Missing/extra column categories

### A. Missing columns?
No genres are missing: you have the same 18 genre variables as the True table.

### B. Extra/incorrect column label
- The generated header incorrectly fuses **New Age/Space** and **Opera** into one label: “New Age/Space Opera”.

**How to fix:**
- Use the correct two separate names.
- Ensure the column count and names align one-to-one with the 18 genres.

---

## 5) Percentages
Neither table shows percentages, so there’s nothing to compare there. If your generated process was supposed to compute percentages, that output is missing (but it is not present in the True table excerpt either).

---

## Bottom line (what to change so generated matches true)
1) **Restore “Don’t know much about it” counts** (currently incorrectly zeroed out).  
2) **Fix “No answer” counts** by not pooling DK/other missing codes into “No answer”.  
3) **Split/rename the header**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera” must be separate genre labels.  
4) Keep mean computation restricted to **1–5 only** (your means already match, so preserve that rule while fixing the M categories).

If you share the coding scheme you used for missing values (e.g., what numeric codes map to DK vs NA), I can point to the exact recode causing the DK→No answer inflation.
