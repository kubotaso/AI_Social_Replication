Score: 58/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing and incorrectly included rows

### A. Missing rows in the generated table
Your generated output has **8 rows**:
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
6. (some extra row with counts)  
7. all zeros  
8. mean  

But the **true table has 8 attitude/summary rows**, specifically:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
7. **(M) No answer**  
8. Mean  

#### Mismatch
- The generated table **does not label** “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer”.
- The generated table contains a **row of all zeros**, which **does not exist** in the true table.
- The generated table’s 6th row appears to be intended as “Don’t know much about it” but has **wrong values**.
- The generated table’s 7th row should be “No answer” but is **all zeros instead of the true nonzero counts**.

#### Fix
- Replace the **all-zero row** with the correct **“(M) No answer”** counts for each genre.
- Ensure the 6th row is correctly populated as **“(M) Don’t know much about it”**.
- Add/retain proper row labels in the output.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

### Rows (1)–(5): main attitude categories
For the five main response categories ((1) Like very much through (5) Dislike very much), the generated counts **match the true table** for all 18 genres (no discrepancies found).

### Row: (M) Don’t know much about it
Your generated 6th row values are **wrong for every genre**. Below are **Generated → True**:

- **Latin/Salsa:** 233 → **221**
- **Jazz:** 53 → **38**
- **Blues/R&B:** 68 → **56**
- **Show Tunes:** 91 → **77**
- **Oldies:** 51 → **41**
- **Classical/Chamber:** 77 → **66**
- **Reggae:** 306 → **295**
- **Swing/Big Band:** 176 → **164**
- **New Age/Space:** 306 → **292**
- **Opera:** 96 → **83**
- **Bluegrass:** 174 → **163**
- **Folk:** 90 → **78**
- **Pop/Easy Listening:** 85 → **72**
- **Contemporary Rock:** 62 → **50**
- **Rap:** 72 → **61**
- **Heavy Metal:** 80 → **70**
- **Country/Western:** 32 → **22**
- **Gospel:** 47 → **35**

#### Fix
Overwrite the entire “Don’t know much about it” row with the true counts:
- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical 66;  
- Reggae 295; Swing 164; New Age 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78;  
- Pop 72; Cont Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country 22; Gospel 35.

### Row: (M) No answer
Your generated 7th row is **all zeros**, but the true table has nonzero “No answer” counts for every genre:

True “No answer” counts (should replace the zeros):
- **Latin/Salsa 12, Jazz 15, Blues/R&B 12, Show Tunes 14, Oldies 10, Classical/Chamber 11**
- **Reggae 11, Swing/Big Band 12, New Age/Space 14, Opera 13, Bluegrass 11, Folk 12**
- **Pop/Easy Listening 13, Contemporary Rock 12, Rap 11, Heavy Metal 10, Country/Western 10, Gospel 12**

#### Fix
Replace the all-zero row with the above “No answer” row.

---

## 3) Percentages: missing entirely
The true Table 3 shown is **counts + mean** (no percentages displayed). Your generated output also shows only counts and mean, so there’s no % mismatch—but if your “generated analysis” was supposed to include percentages, they are **missing**.

#### Fix (only if required)
Compute percentages genre-by-genre using the correct denominator:
- Either total **including** missing categories (DK + No answer), or
- total **excluding** missing categories, depending on the paper’s convention.
Be consistent and label which denominator you used.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means)
The mean row in the generated output matches the true means (to the displayed precision) for all genres:

- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ 2.61  
- …  
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ 4.12  
- Gospel 2.394484 ≈ 2.39  

No mean discrepancies found.

---

## 5) Missing/extra column categories
### Column set
The generated table includes **exactly the 18 genres** in the true frequency table (Table 3):
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No missing or extra genre columns.

### However: “True Results” also include Table 1 and Table 2 (regression tables)
Your generated output corresponds only to **Table 3**. It does **not** reproduce Table 1 or Table 2 at all.

#### Fix
If the task was to reproduce the entire “True Results” section, you must additionally generate:
- Table 1 regression coefficients (3 models) with constants, R², adjusted R², N, and significance stars.
- Table 2 regression coefficients (2 models) with constants, R², adjusted R², N, and note ᵃ.

## What to change so the generated table matches the true table exactly
1. **Replace the 6th row** with the correct **Don’t know much about it** counts (all 18 values listed above).
2. **Delete the all-zero row** and replace it with the correct **No answer** counts (all 18 values listed above).
3. **Label rows** explicitly as in the true table: (1)–(5), (M) DK, (M) No answer, Mean.
4. (If required by your assignment) also generate **Table 1 and Table 2**, not just Table 3.
