Score: 71/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories (names + number of items)

### Mismatch: Missing response categories in the Generated Results
The **Generated Results** table includes these rows:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- (M) Don’t know much about it  
- (M) No answer  
- Mean  

But for **both “(M) Don’t know much about it” and “(M) No answer”**, the generated table incorrectly sets **all values to 0**, whereas the **True Results** show nonzero counts for every genre.

**How to fix**
- Add the correct nonzero counts for **(M) Don’t know much about it** and **(M) No answer** for each genre (see section 2 below for exact values).

### Mismatch: Column header issue (“New Age/Space Opera”)
- Generated column label: **“New Age/Space Opera”**
- True table has **two separate columns**: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**

In the generated table, “Opera” has been incorrectly appended into the “New Age/Space” header, even though the data underneath clearly includes an **Opera** column (with values like 73, 257, 359, 515, 306), matching the True Results’ Opera column.

**How to fix**
- Split/rename the headers to match the True Results:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- Remove “Opera” from the New Age/Space header.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

### A) “(M) Don’t know much about it” row — Generated has all zeros, True has these counts

**Panel 1 genres**
- Latin/Salsa: **221** (generated 0)
- Jazz: **38** (generated 0)
- Blues/R&B: **56** (generated 0)
- Show Tunes: **77** (generated 0)
- Oldies: **41** (generated 0)
- Classical/Chamber: **66** (generated 0)

**Panel 2 genres**
- Reggae: **295** (generated 0)
- Swing/Big Band: **164** (generated 0)
- New Age/Space: **292** (generated 0)
- Opera: **83** (generated 0)
- Bluegrass: **163** (generated 0)
- Folk: **78** (generated 0)

**Panel 3 genres**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72** (generated 0)
- Contemporary Rock: **50** (generated 0)
- Rap: **61** (generated 0)
- Heavy Metal: **70** (generated 0)
- Country/Western: **22** (generated 0)
- Gospel: **35** (generated 0)

**How to fix**
- Replace the entire generated “Don’t know much about it” row of zeros with the values above.

### B) “(M) No answer” row — Generated has all zeros, True has these counts

**Panel 1 genres**
- Latin/Salsa: **12** (generated 0)
- Jazz: **15** (generated 0)
- Blues/R&B: **12** (generated 0)
- Show Tunes: **14** (generated 0)
- Oldies: **10** (generated 0)
- Classical/Chamber: **11** (generated 0)

**Panel 2 genres**
- Reggae: **11** (generated 0)
- Swing/Big Band: **12** (generated 0)
- New Age/Space: **14** (generated 0)
- Opera: **13** (generated 0)
- Bluegrass: **11** (generated 0)
- Folk: **12** (generated 0)

**Panel 3 genres**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13** (generated 0)
- Contemporary Rock: **12** (generated 0)
- Rap: **11** (generated 0)
- Heavy Metal: **10** (generated 0)
- Country/Western: **10** (generated 0)
- Gospel: **12** (generated 0)

**How to fix**
- Replace the entire generated “No answer” row of zeros with the values above.

### C) All other attitude-category counts (1–5) match
For response categories **(1)–(5)**, the generated frequencies match the True Results for all genres (no discrepancies found).

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
All reported **Mean** values in the generated table **match** the True Results **for every genre**.

### Implied totals / denominators (important consequence of the missing M rows)
Even though the mean row matches, the **generated frequency distribution is incomplete** because it omits the nonresponse categories by setting them to zero. That means any totals computed from the generated table would be wrong.

Example consequence:
- For Latin/Salsa, generated total (summing 1–5 only) = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True total including M categories = 1373 + 221 + 12 = **1606**

This same problem occurs for every genre.

**How to fix**
- After inserting correct counts for the two “M” rows, recompute any totals/percentages based on the full N (including M categories if the true table intends them included in the distribution).

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing/incorrect column structure: New Age/Space and Opera
As noted above, the generated header “New Age/Space Opera” is incorrect formatting/labeling relative to the True table, which has two columns.

**How to fix**
- Ensure the generated output has **18 distinct genre columns** with exact names:
  - Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber,
  - Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, **Opera**, Bluegrass, Folk,
  - Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel

## Bottom line: What must change in the generated analysis
1) **Replace all zeros** in:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it”
   - “(M) No answer”
   with the **true counts** listed above.
2) **Fix the headers** so “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are **separate columns** (not merged in the header).
3) If your generated analysis includes **percentages or totals**, recompute them after fixing the M-category rows; otherwise they will not match the true table’s implied Ns.
