Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing response category data were replaced with zeros
- **Row:** “(M) Don’t know much about it”
- **Generated:** all **0** for every genre.
- **True:** nonzero counts for **every genre** (varies by genre; see section 2).

**Fix:** Populate the “Don’t know much about it” row with the true counts (listed below). Do **not** default missing values to 0.

### B. “(M) No answer” row has incorrect values (and looks like it absorbed the missing row)
- **Row:** “(M) No answer”
- **Generated:** large counts (e.g., Latin/Salsa 233; Reggae 176; Swing 306; etc.)
- **True:** very small counts (typically **10–15** per genre)

**Fix:** Replace the generated “No answer” counts with the true “No answer” counts (listed below). The large numbers currently shown are not “No answer” and appear to be a mis-assignment of “Don’t know much about it” (and/or other missing handling).

### C. Column label issue: “New Age/Space Opera” vs “New Age/Space” + “Opera”
- **Generated column:** “New Age/Space Opera” (combined label)
- **True columns:** “New Age/Space” **and** “Opera” are two separate genres (Panel 2 shows them as separate columns)

**Fix:** Split the combined generated header into two separate columns:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**
…and ensure each has its own frequency distribution (the generated data already contain two columns’ worth of counts: one for New Age/Space and one for Opera, but the header is malformed/merged).

### D. Number of genre columns
- Both have **18 genres**, but due to the header merge, the generated output *appears* to have a labeling problem around New Age/Space and Opera.

**Fix:** Ensure there are exactly 18 correctly named genre columns matching the true table:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

The first five attitude categories **(1)–(5)** match the true table for all genres (from what you provided). The mismatches are entirely in the two “M” rows.

### A. “(M) Don’t know much about it” — Generated 0 vs True (nonzero)
Replace generated zeros with these **true counts**:

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa–Classical/Chamber)**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae–Folk)**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening–Gospel)**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

### B. “(M) No answer” — Generated large counts vs True small counts
Replace generated “No answer” counts with these **true counts**:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12** (generated 233)
- Jazz **15** (generated 53)
- Blues/R&B **12** (generated 68)
- Show Tunes **14** (generated 91)
- Oldies **10** (generated 51)
- Classical/Chamber **11** (generated 77)

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11** (generated 176)
- Swing/Big Band **12** (generated 306)
- New Age/Space **14** (generated 306)
- Opera **13** (generated 96)
- Bluegrass **11** (generated 174)
- Folk **12** (generated 90)

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13** (generated 85)
- Contemporary Rock **12** (generated 62)
- Rap **11** (generated 72)
- Heavy Metal **10** (generated 80)
- Country/Western **10** (generated 32)
- Gospel **12** (generated 47)

**Likely cause:** Your pipeline probably (a) dropped the “Don’t know much about it” category, then (b) recoded its counts into “No answer,” or (c) treated one missing code as another. In GSS-style data, “Don’t know much about it” is *not* the same as item nonresponse.

**Fix in code/logic:** Ensure the two missing-like categories are distinct and mapped correctly to separate labels.

---

## 3) Percentages
- **Generated output shows no percentages**, only counts. The prompt asks to check percentages, but none were generated.

**Fix:** If you intend to report percentages, compute them from the same denominator the true table uses (likely including/excluding missing depending on convention). Then add % columns or parenthetical percentages consistently across all genres.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (Means)
- **Means in the generated table match the true means** for every genre **as listed** (e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Gospel 2.39).

**However:** given the “M” rows are wrong, the mean can still coincidentally match if:
- the mean was computed only from valid responses (1–5) and excluded M-categories, *and*
- your valid counts (1–5) match.

**Fix/validation step:** Document and enforce the mean rule:
- Mean should be computed on responses **1–5 only**, excluding both “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer.”
- Confirm the valid N used for the mean per genre is the sum of rows (1)–(5), not including M rows.

---

## 5) Missing/extra column categories
- **Extra/incorrect column name:** “New Age/Space Opera” (should not exist as a single genre).
- **Missing correct column names:** “New Age/Space” and “Opera” as separate headers.

**Fix:** Correct the headers and keep their data separate.

---

## 6) What to change so the generated table matches the true table

1. **Correct the genre headers**
   - Rename to “New Age/Space” and “Opera” (two columns), not “New Age/Space Opera.”

2. **Restore the “Don’t know much about it” counts**
   - Replace all zeros with the true values listed above (or re-run tabulations with the correct category mapping).

3. **Correct the “No answer” mapping**
   - Replace the inflated “No answer” counts with the true small values listed above.
   - In your recode, ensure:
     - “Don’t know much about it” has its own explicit category/code
     - “No answer” includes only item nonresponse/refused/not ascertained codes (whichever the original instrument defines)

4. **(Optional but recommended) Add QC checks**
   - For each genre, verify:  
     **Total N = (1)+(2)+(3)+(4)+(5)+(DK)+(NA)** matches across true and generated.
   - Ensure no category has impossible zeros when others clearly have missing-like responses.

If you share the coding scheme (numeric codes) you used for the two “M” categories, I can point to the exact recode mistake (e.g., “8/9 treated as NA” vs “0 treated as DK,” etc.).
