Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories (names and number of items)

### Mismatch: Missing response rows in the generated table
Your **Generated Results** include these rows:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- (M) Don’t know much about it  
- (M) No answer  
- Mean  

But in the generated table, the **two “(M)” rows are present with all zeros**, whereas the **True Results** have **nonzero counts** for both:
- **(M) Don’t know much about it** (nonzero in every genre)
- **(M) No answer** (nonzero in every genre)

**How to fix:** Populate the “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” rows with the correct frequencies from the true table (see section 2 below). Do not set them to 0.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

### Good news: All 1–5 category counts match
For every genre, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
match the **True Results** exactly.

### Mismatch: All “(M)” frequencies are wrong (set to 0)
For **every genre**, the generated table shows:
- (M) Don’t know much about it = 0  
- (M) No answer = 0  

These should be the following (copy from True Results):

#### Panel 1 missing (M) counts
- **Latin/Salsa:** DK=221, NA=12  
- **Jazz:** DK=38, NA=15  
- **Blues/R&B:** DK=56, NA=12  
- **Show Tunes:** DK=77, NA=14  
- **Oldies:** DK=41, NA=10  
- **Classical/Chamber:** DK=66, NA=11  

#### Panel 2 missing (M) counts
- **Reggae:** DK=295, NA=11  
- **Swing/Big Band:** DK=164, NA=12  
- **New Age/Space:** DK=292, NA=14  
- **Opera:** DK=83, NA=13  
- **Bluegrass:** DK=163, NA=11  
- **Folk:** DK=78, NA=12  

#### Panel 3 missing (M) counts
- **Pop/Easy Listening:** DK=72, NA=13  
- **Contemporary Rock:** DK=50, NA=12  
- **Rap:** DK=61, NA=11  
- **Heavy Metal:** DK=70, NA=10  
- **Country/Western:** DK=22, NA=10  
- **Gospel:** DK=35, NA=12  

**How to fix:** Replace the zeros in both (M) rows with these true values for each column.

## 3) Column/category mismatches (missing/extra columns, incorrect column names)

### Mismatch: “New Age/Space Opera” is incorrectly labeled/merged
- **Generated column:** “New Age/Space Opera” (one column)
- **True Results:** two separate columns:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**

In the generated table, you actually have **both sets of counts present**, but the **header is wrong**:
- Under the single header “New Age/Space Opera” the counts shown are **New Age/Space** (48, 186, 269, 429, 368… mean 3.68).
- But you also have a separate column labeled **“Opera”** (73, 257, 359, 515, 306… mean 3.48).

So the generated output effectively has:
- A correct **New Age/Space** column but mislabeled as “New Age/Space Opera”
- A correct **Opera** column (already present)

**How to fix:**
- Rename the generated “New Age/Space Opera” column to **“New Age/Space”**
- Keep **“Opera”** as its own separate column (as already displayed)

### Column count
Once you correct the label, the generated table has the same set of 18 genres as the true table (no extra/missing genre columns).

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: they match the true table
All means shown in the generated table match the True Results (for each genre).

### Hidden problem: If means were computed including the (M) rows, they would be wrong
Even though the displayed means match, the generated table currently reports **0 missing/NA counts**, which implies either:
- the analysis **dropped missing cases** silently when computing the mean, or
- it **coded DK/NA as something else**, but still printed them as 0 in the frequency table.

Given the true table, means are typically computed on valid responses (1–5) excluding DK/NA. Your means match the true table, so the mean computation is consistent with the true table—but the **missingness reporting is not**.

**How to fix:**
- Ensure the frequency table includes DK/NA counts (as above).
- Ensure the mean is computed on valid codes 1–5 only (i.e., exclude DK/NA), matching the published approach.

---

## 5) Percentages (requested) — not present in generated output
You asked to compare “frequency counts or percentages,” but:
- **Generated Results:** counts only (no %)
- **True Results:** counts only (no %)

So there are **no percentage mismatches to report**, but there *is* a format mismatch vs your stated requirement if you expected percentages.

**How to fix (if percentages are required):**
- Add a % column or compute cell percentages per genre (denominator should be specified: total including DK/NA, or valid-only). The published table shows counts only.

---

# Minimal set of corrections required for the generated output to match the true table

1) Replace the all-zero **(M) Don’t know much about it** row with the true DK counts for all 18 genres.  
2) Replace the all-zero **(M) No answer** row with the true NA counts for all 18 genres.  
3) Fix the column header **“New Age/Space Opera” → “New Age/Space”** (since Opera is already a separate column).  

After those changes, the generated table will match the true table in:
- row categories
- frequencies
- genre columns
- means
