Score: 74/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

**Mismatch: missing attitude rows in the generated table**
- The **generated results include only 5 response rows** (the five “like/dislike” categories), then show **two all-zero rows**, then the mean.
- The **true table has 7 non-mean rows**:
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
  7. (M) No answer  
  + Mean

**What’s wrong:**  
The generated table is **missing “Don’t know much about it”** and **“No answer”** counts and instead incorrectly reports **0** for those categories (twice).

**Fix:**  
Replace the two zero rows with the correct missing-data rows (with their correct counts for every genre), and label them:
- “(M) Don’t know much about it”
- “(M) No answer”

---

### 2) Frequency counts (and implied totals)

#### A. The first five response categories (1)–(5)
**These match exactly** between generated and true results for all 18 genres:
- Every value shown in the generated table for rows (1) through (5) matches the true table.

So there are **no mismatches** in the substantive attitude distributions.

#### B. Missing-data categories (M)
**These are entirely wrong in the generated table** (shown as all zeros), but are **nonzero in the true table** for every genre.

Below are the correct values that must replace the two zero rows in the generated output.

##### (M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE counts
- Latin/Salsa **221**, Jazz **38**, Blues/R&B **56**, Show Tunes **77**, Oldies **41**, Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**, Swing/Big Band **164**, New Age/Space **292**, Opera **83**, Bluegrass **163**, Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**, Contemporary Rock **50**, Rap **61**, Heavy Metal **70**, Country/Western **22**, Gospel **35**

##### (M) No answer — TRUE counts
- Latin/Salsa **12**, Jazz **15**, Blues/R&B **12**, Show Tunes **14**, Oldies **10**, Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**, Swing/Big Band **12**, New Age/Space **14**, Opera **13**, Bluegrass **11**, Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**, Contemporary Rock **12**, Rap **11**, Heavy Metal **10**, Country/Western **10**, Gospel **12**

**Fix:**  
Populate those two rows with these values. If you are computing from microdata, ensure your tabulation includes missing/NA categories rather than dropping them.

### 3) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

#### Means
**Means match** between generated and true tables for all genres:
- Panel 1 means: 3.14, 2.61, 2.50, 2.59, 2.25, 2.67
- Panel 2 means: 3.15, 2.45, 3.68, 3.48, 2.67, 2.76
- Panel 3 means: 2.41, 2.67, 3.92, 4.12, 2.32, 2.39

So the **mean row is correct**.

#### Internal inconsistency to watch for (important)
Even though the means match, the generated output is inconsistent because:
- It shows **0 missing** (“Don’t know” and “No answer”), but
- The means in the published table are typically computed **excluding missing**, not pretending missing=0 frequency.

**Fix:**  
Confirm and enforce the same mean calculation rule as the true table:
- Compute mean using only valid responses (1)–(5)
- Report missing categories separately (as in the true table)

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories (headers/structure)

**Column set appears correct (18 genres), but there is a header discrepancy:**
- True table splits “New Age/Space” and “Opera” into two separate genre columns (Panel 2).
- Generated header shows **“New Age/Space Opera”**, which is ambiguous and could be read as one combined label, but the numbers clearly correspond to **two separate columns**:
  - New Age/Space: (1)=48, (2)=186, (3)=269, (4)=429, (5)=368
  - Opera: (1)=73, (2)=257, (3)=359, (4)=515, (5)=306

**Fix:**  
Rename the headers to exactly match the true table:
- “New Age/Space”
- “Opera”
…and ensure they are distinct columns (not a single merged category).

---

## Summary of *every* mismatch
1. **Two rows are wrong**: the generated table has two all-zero rows where it should have:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it (nonzero counts)
   - (M) No answer (nonzero counts)
2. **One header/label issue**: “New Age/Space Opera” should be **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.
3. **All other counts (rows 1–5) and means match** the true table.

If you want, paste the code/output format you’re using (R/Stata/Python), and I’ll tell you exactly how to modify the tabulation to include the two missing categories and fix the column labeling.
