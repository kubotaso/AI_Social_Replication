Score: 78/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names/number of items)

**A. “Opera” is missing as its own column in the Generated Results**
- **True table (Panel 2)** has **two separate columns**: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.
- **Generated table** incorrectly merges them into **one column** labeled **“New Age/Space Opera”**.
- **Fix:** Split the merged column into **two columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
  and use the correct counts for each (see section 2).

**B. Response-category labels are present, but the “M” rows are wrong for many columns**
- The Generated table has the right *types* of rows (1–5 plus two “M” rows and Mean), but the **values in the “(M) Don’t know much about it” and “(M) No answer” rows** do not match the True table for many genres.
- **Fix:** Replace the “M” row values with the True table’s values (detailed below).

**C. No percentages anywhere**
- Your checklist mentions “counts or percentages,” but **neither the Generated nor True tables include percentages**—only counts and means.
- **Fix (optional):** If percentages are desired, add them consistently for both. Otherwise, ignore “percentages” as not applicable here.

### 2) Frequency-count mismatches (every incorrect cell)

Below are **all mismatched cells** (Generated → True). Anything not listed matches.

#### Panel 1 columns (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa: **152 → 221**
- Jazz: **49 → 38**
- Blues/R&B: **48 → 56**
- Show Tunes: **69 → 77**
- Oldies: **45 → 41**
- Classical/Chamber: **60 → 66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa: **81 → 12**
- Jazz: **4 → 15**
- Blues/R&B: **20 → 12**
- Show Tunes: **22 → 14**
- Oldies: **6 → 10**
- Classical/Chamber: **17 → 11**

All other rows (1–5) and means in Panel 1 match.

---

#### Panel 2 columns (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)

**Problem first:** Generated merges **New Age/Space + Opera** into one column, so several values are inherently wrong/misaligned.

**Reggae**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **164 → 295**
- (M) No answer: **142 → 11**
  - Note: Generated “No answer” for Reggae is wildly off and appears to be pulled from somewhere else.

**Swing/Big Band**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **97 → 164**
- (M) No answer: **79 → 12**

**New Age/Space and Opera (must be split)**
Generated has one column “New Age/Space Opera” with:
- Like very much 48, Like it 186, Mixed 269, Dislike 429, Dislike very much 368, DK 166, No answer 140, Mean 3.68

Compare to True:

**New Age/Space (True)**
- Like very much: **48** (matches)
- Like it: **186** (matches)
- Mixed feelings: **269** (matches)
- Dislike it: **429** (matches)
- Dislike very much: **368** (matches)
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **166 → 292** (mismatch)
- (M) No answer: **140 → 14** (mismatch)
- Mean: **3.68** (matches)

**Opera (True)** — completely missing as a separate column
- Like very much: **73**
- Like it: **257**
- Mixed feelings: **359**
- Dislike it: **515**
- Dislike very much: **306**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **83**
- (M) No answer: **13**
- Mean: **3.48**

So the Generated column is basically **New Age/Space’s 1–5 and mean**, but its “M” rows are wrong, and **Opera is absent**.

**Bluegrass**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **105 → 163**
- (M) No answer: **69 → 11**

**Folk**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **66 → 78**
- (M) No answer: **24 → 12**

All other rows (1–5) and means for Reggae/Swing/Bluegrass/Folk match.

---

#### Panel 3 columns (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)

**Pop/Easy Listening**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **64 → 72**
- (M) No answer: **21 → 13**

**Contemporary Rock**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **50** (matches)
- (M) No answer: **12** (matches)
(No mismatches here.)

**Rap**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **58 → 61**
- (M) No answer: **14 → 11**

**Heavy Metal**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **67 → 70**
- (M) No answer: **13 → 10**

**Country/Western**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **28 → 22**
- (M) No answer: **4 → 10**

**Gospel**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **35** (matches)
- (M) No answer: **12** (matches)
(No mismatches here.)

All other rows (1–5) and means in Panel 3 match.

### 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:**  
- All reported **Means match the True table** for every genre **except** that the Generated table is missing the **separate Opera mean (3.48)** because Opera is missing as its own column.

**Totals / N checks:**  
- The True table implies a constant overall N per genre (GSS items typically have same N), but the Generated table’s incorrect “M” rows imply **different totals** and thus inconsistency.
- Example (Latin/Salsa):
  - True total = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
  - Generated total = 85+325+416+403+144+152+81 = **1606**
  - Here the *total coincidentally matches* because the Generated swapped values between DK and No answer (221 got split into 152+81), but the category breakdown is wrong.
- For many columns, totals may still match by accident, but the **distribution across missing categories is incorrect**.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

**Extra/incorrect column:**  
- **“New Age/Space Opera”** is not a valid genre column in the True table.
  - It should be **two separate columns**.

**Missing column:**  
- **Opera** is missing entirely.

**Fix:**  
- Replace the single merged column with:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
and populate each with the correct frequencies and means.

---

### 5) How to fix the generated analysis so it matches the true table

1. **Split the merged genre column**
   - Remove “New Age/Space Opera”
   - Add **New Age/Space** and **Opera** as separate columns.

2. **Replace all incorrect “M” rows with the True values**
   - Systematically overwrite the Generated table’s:
     - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
     - **(M) No answer**
   using the True table counts listed above.

3. **Re-run any computations that depend on those rows**
   - If you computed any derived stats (percentages, valid N, missing rates), recompute after correcting the M rows.
   - Means appear already correct (since they likely use only 1–5), but if your mean calculation used a different denominator, verify it matches the True table’s method.

If you want, I can provide a fully corrected “Generated Results” table in the same wide format as yours (with separate New Age/Space and Opera columns) so it exactly reproduces the True table.
