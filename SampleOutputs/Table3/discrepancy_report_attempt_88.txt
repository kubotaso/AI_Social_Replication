Score: 84/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

**A. Column header error: “New Age/Space Opera”**
- **Generated:** `New Age/Space Opera` (looks like one combined genre)
- **True:** two separate columns: `New Age/Space` **and** `Opera`
- **Fix:** Split the generated combined column into **two distinct columns**:
  - `New Age/Space`
  - `Opera`
  and ensure each has its own full set of frequencies + mean.

**B. Because of (A), the “Opera” genre is missing as its own column**
- **Generated:** No standalone `Opera` column.
- **True:** `Opera` is a separate genre with its own frequencies/mean.
- **Fix:** Add the missing `Opera` column (using the true values shown in Panel 2).

**C. (Implicit) Column count mismatch**
- **True:** 18 genres.
- **Generated:** Appears to show 18 headers, but one of them is incorrectly merged (`New Age/Space Opera`), meaning you effectively have **17 real genres represented correctly + 1 corrupted/merged label**.
- **Fix:** Ensure there are **18 correctly labeled, distinct genre columns**, matching the true table exactly.

  - True: **15**
  - **Fix:** 5 → **15**

### Blues/R&B

  - Generated: **61**
  - True: **56**
  - **Fix:** 61 → **56**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **7**
  - True: **12**
  - **Fix:** 7 → **12**

### Show Tunes

  - **Fix:** 9 → **14**

  - True: **41**
  - **Fix:** 46 → **41**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **5**
  - True: **10**
  - **Fix:** 5 → **10**

### Classical/Chamber

  - **Fix:** 69 → **66**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **8**
  - True: **11**
  - **Fix:** 8 → **11**

## Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)

### Reggae
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **275**
  - True: **295**
  - **Fix:** 275 → **295**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **31**
  - True: **11**
  - **Fix:** 31 → **11**

### Swing/Big Band
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **158**
  - True: **164**
  - **Fix:** 158 → **164**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **18**
  - True: **12**
  - **Fix:** 18 → **12**

### New Age/Space (label also wrong in generated; see section 1)
Using the generated column `New Age/Space Opera`, the values align with **New Age/Space** for the first five rows and mean, but the “missing” rows do not:
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **275**
  - True (New Age/Space): **292**
  - **Fix:** 275 → **292**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **31**
  - True (New Age/Space): **14**
  - **Fix:** 31 → **14**

### Opera (entire column missing; generated values appear mixed/misplaced)
True Opera values (must be added as a separate column):
- Like very much 73
- Like it 257
- Mixed feelings 359
- Dislike it 515
- Dislike very much 306
- Don’t know much 83
- No answer 13
- Mean 3.48

In the generated table, the numbers under `Opera`-like position are inconsistent:
- Generated “Don’t know” for “Opera” appears as **86** but true is **83**
- Generated “No answer” appears as **10** but true is **13**
So even where the Opera-related numbers appear, they do **not** match exactly.

**Fix:** Create a standalone `Opera` column and populate it exactly with the true counts above.

### Bluegrass
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **157**
  - True: **163**
  - **Fix:** 157 → **163**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **17**
  - True: **11**
  - **Fix:** 17 → **11**

### Folk
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **81**
  - True: **78**
  - **Fix:** 81 → **78**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **9**
  - True: **12**
  - **Fix:** 9 → **12**

### Pop/Easy Listening
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **76**
  - True: **72**
  - **Fix:** 76 → **72**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **9**
  - True: **13**
  - **Fix:** 9 → **13**

### Contemporary Rock
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **56**
  - True: **50**
  - **Fix:** 56 → **50**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **6**
  - True: **12**
  - **Fix:** 6 → **12**

### Rap
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **65**
  - True: **61**
  - **Fix:** 65 → **61**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **7**
  - True: **11**
  - **Fix:** 7 → **11**

### Heavy Metal
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **72**
  - True: **70**
  - **Fix:** 72 → **70**
- **(M) No answer**
  - Generated: **8**
  - True: **10**
  - **Fix:** 8 → **10**

### Country/Western
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - Generated: **29**

  - True: **35**
  - **Fix:** 42 → **35**

  - Generated: **5**
  - True: **12**
  - **Fix:** 5 → **12**

### 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** All the **means shown in the generated table match** the true table *for the genres that are properly defined*.

However, the **mean for “Opera”** is not correctly represented because:
- the column is **missing/merged** (`New Age/Space Opera` issue),
- and the Opera “missing” category counts are wrong where they appear.

**Fix:** After splitting `New Age/Space` and `Opera` into separate columns and correcting their (M) rows, verify means are computed on the same coding rules as the true table (typically excluding M categories). The target means are:
- New Age/Space: **3.68**
- Opera: **3.48**

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

- **Missing:** `Opera` (as its own column)
- **Incorrect/extra merged label:** `New Age/Space Opera` (should not exist as a single column)
- **Fix:** Replace the merged column with two columns: `New Age/Space` and `Opera`, each with correct counts and means.

---

## What to change (minimal “patch list”)

1) **Rename/split column:** `New Age/Space Opera` → `New Age/Space` + `Opera`
2) **Insert Opera column** with true values (73, 257, 359, 515, 306, 83, 13; mean 3.48)
3) **Correct all (M) rows** (`Don’t know much about it`, `No answer`) for every genre listed above to match the true counts exactly.

If you want, I can produce a fully corrected “generated” table laid out in the same single-panel format as yours, with all fixed values inserted.
