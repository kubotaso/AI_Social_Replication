Score: 67/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names/number of items)

### A. Missing response categories (rows) in the **Generated Results**
The true table has **8 rows** per genre:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean

Your generated output shows **8 rows**, but rows **6 and 7 are wrong**:
- Row 6 in generated output contains numbers, but it is not labeled and **does not match** either “Don’t know much about it” or “No answer”.
- Row 7 is **all zeros**, which is impossible given the true table has nonzero “No answer” counts for every genre.

**Fix:** Add two explicit rows:
- “(M) Don’t know much about it”
- “(M) No answer”
and populate them with the correct counts from the true table. Remove the all-zero row.

### B. Labels are missing in the generated table
The generated table includes only numeric rows without row labels, making it ambiguous.

**Fix:** Add the row labels exactly as in the true table (including “(M)” markers), and keep the same row order.

### C. Column categories (genres)
All **18 genres** appear in the generated output and match the true table’s genres. No missing/extra genre columns.

**Fix:** None needed for column set—only ensure ordering/grouping is consistent if you’re aiming to replicate Table 3’s three-panel layout (optional).

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

For rows 1–5 (Like very much → Dislike very much), the generated counts **match** the true table for every genre.

All mismatches occur in the “missing data” rows:

### A. “Don’t know much about it” row (true) vs generated row 6
Generated row 6 values do **not** match the true “Don’t know much about it” counts for **any** genre. Example mismatches:

- **Latin/Salsa**
  - True Don’t know: **221**
  - Generated row 6: **233** (wrong)

- **Jazz**
  - True Don’t know: **38**
  - Generated row 6: **53** (wrong)

- **Oldies**
  - True Don’t know: **41**
  - Generated row 6: **51** (wrong)

- **Reggae**
  - True Don’t know: **295**
  - Generated row 6: **306** (wrong)

- **Rap**
  - True Don’t know: **61**
  - Generated row 6: **72** (wrong)

- **Heavy Metal**
  - True Don’t know: **70**
  - Generated row 6: **80** (wrong)

This pattern holds for all 18 genres.

**Fix:** Replace the entire generated row 6 with the true “(M) Don’t know much about it” counts:

- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66;  
- Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78;  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35.

### B. “No answer” row (true) vs generated row 7
Generated row 7 is all zeros, but the true table has nonzero counts everywhere, e.g.:
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- … etc.

**Fix:** Replace the all-zero row with the true “(M) No answer” counts:

- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11;  
- Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12;  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12.

### C. Percentages
Your generated table shows counts only (no percentages). The user request mentions percentages, but the true table also shows counts (and means), not percentages.

**Fix (only if needed):**
- Either (a) keep counts only to match the true table, or
- (b) add percentage columns/rows computed as count / total N for that genre, but then the “true” comparison must also include percentages (it currently doesn’t).

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### A. Means
The generated “Mean” row matches the true means to the shown precision for all genres:

- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ 2.61  
- …  
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ 4.12  
No mismatch here.

**Fix:** None.

### B. Implied totals / N per genre are wrong if you use generated rows 6–7
In the true table, each genre’s total N (sum of 1–5 + DK + NA) is consistent. Example:

- **Latin/Salsa true total**
  - 85+325+416+403+144 +221+12 = **1606**

In generated output, because row 6 is wrong and row 7 is zero:
- Latin/Salsa generated total would be 85+325+416+403+144 +233+0 = **1606** (coincidentally matches here)
But that’s not generally reliable, and the *composition* of missing data is definitely wrong even if some totals accidentally align.

**Fix:** Use the correct DK and NA rows so both totals *and category breakdown* match the true table.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

- **No extra genres** appear in generated output.
- **No genre is missing.**
- However, the generated output is missing the **Attitude** column (row labels) that the true table includes.

**Fix:** Add an “Attitude” label column (or row names) so the structure matches Table 3.

---

## 5) How to correct the generated table to match the true table (exact steps)

1. **Add row labels** in this order:
   - (1) Like very much  
   - (2) Like it  
   - (3) Mixed feelings  
   - (4) Dislike it  
   - (5) Dislike very much  
   - (M) Don’t know much about it  
   - (M) No answer  
   - Mean  

2. **Keep rows 1–5 as-is** (they already match).

3. **Replace generated row 6** with the true “Don’t know much about it” counts (listed above).

4. **Replace generated row 7 (zeros)** with the true “No answer” counts (listed above).

5. **Keep the mean row** as-is (it matches).

If you want, I can rewrite the generated table in the exact Table 3 format (three panels) with the corrected DK/NA rows inserted.
