Score: 68/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names/number of items)

### A. Missing rows in the Generated Results
Your generated table includes these rows:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much
- (M) Don’t know much about it
- (M) No answer
- Mean

But the values for the two “(M)” rows are **all zeros** across every genre, which effectively means those categories are **missing from the analysis** (they exist as labels but not as real data).

**True table requires nonzero counts** for both:
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

So: the generated output is missing valid frequency counts for two response categories.

**Fix:** When producing frequency tables, treat the “M” categories as valid response outcomes and tabulate them from the raw data (or from the published table) rather than defaulting them to 0 / dropping them as missing.

---

### B. Column/category structure mismatch (genre headers)
The true table’s Panel 2 has **two separate columns**:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

The generated table incorrectly merges these into one header:
- **“New Age/Space Opera”** (single column)

This is a **category/name mismatch and a wrong number of items** (17 columns in generated vs 18 in true).

**Fix:** Split “New Age/Space” and “Opera” into two separate genre variables/columns, each with its own frequency distribution and mean.

---

## 2) Frequency counts per response category

### A. Rows (1)–(5): Like → Dislike
For every genre, the generated counts for categories:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly** (including for the “Opera” counts—but only because the generated table’s combined “New Age/Space Opera” column is actually using the **Opera** counts, not New Age).

No mismatches here **except where the wrong genre is being represented due to the merged column** (see below).

---

### B. “(M) Don’t know much about it”: generated is all 0 but true is nonzero everywhere
This is a mismatch for **all genres**. True values are:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Generated table has 0 for all of these.**

**Fix:** Include these counts when building the distribution. In code terms: do not recode “don’t know” to missing/excluded; treat it as its own category.

---

### C. “(M) No answer”: generated is all 0 but true is nonzero everywhere
Again, mismatch for **all genres**. True values are:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Same as above—tabulate “no answer” as a separate category, not as 0 / not dropped.

---

### D. The merged “New Age/Space Opera” column is wrong (counts assigned to the wrong genre)
Compare the true table:

- **New Age/Space** has:
  - Like very much 48
  - Like it 186
  - Mixed 269
  - Dislike 429
  - Dislike very much 368
  - Don’t know 292
  - No answer 14
  - Mean 3.68

- **Opera** has:
  - Like very much 73
  - Like it 257
  - Mixed 359
  - Dislike 515
  - Dislike very much 306
  - Don’t know 83
  - No answer 13
  - Mean 3.48

Your generated “New Age/Space Opera” column shows:
- 48, 186, 269, 429, 368, 0, 0, mean 3.68

Those first five + mean correspond to **New Age/Space**, not Opera. But your *header* implies it’s both combined, and Opera as a separate column is missing.

**Fix:** Create **two columns**:
- New Age/Space (with the New Age/Space numbers)
- Opera (with the Opera numbers)

…and fill in the (M) rows for each.

---

## 3) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### A. Means
All means displayed in the generated table **match** the true means for the genres shown.

However, because:
- you **omitted Opera as its own column**, and
- you **merged the header** (“New Age/Space Opera”),

you are missing the **Opera mean (3.48)** as a distinct statistic.

**Fix:** Add the Opera column and its mean = **3.48**.

---

### B. Implicit sample size / totals per genre (major mismatch due to M-rows being zeroed)
Even though you didn’t display totals, the generated frequencies imply a smaller N per genre because you effectively excluded “Don’t know” and “No answer”.

Example (Latin/Salsa):

- Generated total across (1)–(5):
  - 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True additional M categories:
  - Don’t know 221, No answer 12 → +233
- True total:
  - 1373 + 221 + 12 = **1606**

So the generated analysis is using **N=1373** while the true table uses **N=1606** for Latin/Salsa (and similarly for other genres).

**Fix:** When computing frequencies/percentages, use the full N including categories (M) Don’t know and (M) No answer. (If you are computing means, ensure you replicate the table’s rule—typically means are computed on valid 1–5 only; the published mean likely excludes M categories. But frequencies must still report them.)

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column
- **Opera** is missing as its own genre column.

### Incorrect/extra combined column
- **“New Age/Space Opera”** should not exist; it replaces two distinct columns.

**Fix:** Replace the single merged column with two separate columns:
- New Age/Space
- Opera

---

## What to change so “Generated Results” matches the True table

1. **Split the merged genre header**:
   - Remove “New Age/Space Opera”
   - Add **New Age/Space** and **Opera** as separate columns.

2. **Populate the two (M) rows** with the true counts instead of zeros:
   - Fill “(M) Don’t know much about it” for all 18 genres.
   - Fill “(M) No answer” for all 18 genres.

3. **Ensure totals/percentages use the correct denominator**:
   - If computing percentages, base them on the full counts including M categories (to match the published frequency distribution).
   - Keep mean calculation consistent with the published table rule (almost certainly computed from 1–5 only, excluding M categories).

If you want, paste the code or rules you used to generate the table (especially how you treated missing/Don’t know/No answer and how you parsed genre names), and I’ll point to the exact lines/logic that caused the zeros and the “New Age/Space Opera” merge.
