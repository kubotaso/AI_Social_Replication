Score: 70/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches

### A. Category names/structure
- **True table (Panel 2) has two separate columns: `New Age/Space` and `Opera`.**
- **Generated table incorrectly merges these into a single column label: `New Age/Space Opera`.**
  - This is not just a naming issue: it collapses **two distinct genres** into one, which makes the generated table structurally incompatible with the true table.

**Fix:** Split the generated `New Age/Space Opera` column into **two columns**:
- `New Age/Space`
- `Opera`
…and populate each with the correct counts from the true table.

### B. Number of columns (genres)
- **True:** 18 genres.
- **Generated:** 17 genres, because `New Age/Space` + `Opera` were merged.

**Fix:** Add the missing genre column by splitting as above, restoring **18 total**.

### C. Row categories (attitude response options)
Row labels match in content (1–5 plus two “M” categories plus Mean). No row category is missing or extra.  
However, the generated results have slightly different capitalization/typography (“Don’t know much about it” etc.)—that’s cosmetic, not a data mismatch.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre × response category)

All counts match the true table **except** the two “missing-data” rows for many genres:

### Panel 1 mismatches: `(M) Don’t know much about it` and `(M) No answer`

For each genre below, Generated ≠ True:

**Latin/Salsa**
- Don’t know: **228 vs 221** (Generated +7)
- No answer: **5 vs 12** (Generated −7)

**Jazz**
- Don’t know: **52 vs 38** (+14)
- No answer: **1 vs 15** (−14)

**Blues/R&B**
- Don’t know: **67 vs 56** (+11)
- No answer: **1 vs 12** (−11)

**Show Tunes**
- Don’t know: **89 vs 77** (+12)
- No answer: **2 vs 14** (−12)

**Oldies**
- Don’t know: **50 vs 41** (+9)
- No answer: **1 vs 10** (−9)

**Classical/Chamber**
- Don’t know: **75 vs 66** (+9)
- No answer: **2 vs 11** (−9)

**Pattern:** In every case, the generated table appears to have **shifted cases from “No answer” into “Don’t know much about it”** while keeping the sum of those two rows constant for that genre.

---

### Panel 2 mismatches: `(M) Don’t know much about it` and `(M) No answer`

**Reggae**
- Don’t know: **300 vs 295** (+5)
- No answer: **6 vs 11** (−5)

**Swing/Big Band**
- Don’t know: **172 vs 164** (+8)
- No answer: **4 vs 12** (−8)

**New Age/Space Opera (structural error + wrong values)**
Because the column is merged, **none of these can be correct** relative to the true table. Specifically:

- True `New Age/Space`:
  - Don’t know: **292**
  - No answer: **14**
- True `Opera`:
  - Don’t know: **83**
  - No answer: **13**

Generated merged column shows:
- Don’t know: **300**
- No answer: **6**

Those don’t equal either genre and don’t equal a correct split. Even if you tried to interpret it as “New Age/Space”, it’s wrong (300 vs 292; 6 vs 14). If you interpret as “Opera”, it’s wildly wrong.

**Bluegrass**
- Don’t know: **171 vs 163** (+8)
- No answer: **3 vs 11** (−8)

**Folk**
- Don’t know: **88 vs 78** (+10)
- No answer: **2 vs 12** (−10)

**Pattern:** Again, systematic shifting from “No answer” → “Don’t know”.

---

### Panel 3 mismatches: `(M) Don’t know much about it` and `(M) No answer`

**Pop/Easy Listening**
- Don’t know: **83 vs 72** (+11)
- No answer: **2 vs 13** (−11)

**Contemporary Rock**
- Don’t know: **61 vs 50** (+11)
- No answer: **1 vs 12** (−11)

**Rap**
- Don’t know: **71 vs 61** (+10)
- No answer: **1 vs 11** (−10)

**Heavy Metal**
- Don’t know: **78 vs 70** (+8)
- No answer: **2 vs 10** (−8)

**Country/Western**
- Don’t know: **31 vs 22** (+9)
- No answer: **1 vs 10** (−9)

**Gospel**
- Don’t know: **46 vs 35** (+11)
- No answer: **1 vs 12** (−11)

**Pattern:** Same consistent misallocation.

---

## 3) Percentages
- The generated output contains **no percentages**, while your instructions ask to check them. The true table provided also contains **counts only** (no %).
- So: **no percentage mismatches can be evaluated** because percentages are not present in either set.

**Fix (if percentages are desired):** compute percentages using the correct denominator per genre (usually total N for that genre including missing categories, unless specified otherwise).

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- All displayed means in the generated table **match** the true means **for the genres that exist as separate columns**.
- The only mean that is **structurally invalid** is for the merged `New Age/Space Opera` column, because the true table has **two separate means**:
  - New Age/Space mean = **3.68**
  - Opera mean = **3.48**
- Generated shows **3.48** under the merged label, which corresponds to **Opera**, not New Age/Space—so it’s wrong for New Age/Space and meaningless for a merged column.

**Fix:** After splitting the column, set:
- `New Age/Space` mean = 3.68
- `Opera` mean = 3.48

### Totals / implied Ns (consistency check)
Within each genre, the generated table appears to preserve the overall total by **moving counts between “No answer” and “Don’t know”**. That keeps totals stable, which is why the means can still match (means likely computed excluding missing categories, or computed from valid 1–5 only). But the **distribution of missing categories is wrong**, which is a real discrepancy from the true table.

**Fix:** Use the true missing-category counts as given.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

- **Missing column:** `Opera` (should be its own genre column).
- **Incorrect column:** `New Age/Space Opera` (should not exist).
- All other genre columns match the true set.

**Fix:** Replace the merged column with two columns:
- `New Age/Space`
- `Opera`

---

## What to change so the generated table matches the true table

1) **Split the merged genre column**
- Remove `New Age/Space Opera`
- Add `New Age/Space` and `Opera` with the exact counts and means from the true table.

2) **Correct missing-data rows for every genre**
- Replace generated `(M) Don’t know much about it` and `(M) No answer` counts with the true values (listed above).
- The core 1–5 attitude counts are already correct; the issue is specifically the two “M” categories.

3) **(Optional) Validate your recode logic**
- The repeated pattern strongly suggests your code accidentally:
  - recoded `No answer` responses into `Don’t know much about it`, or
  - collapsed two missing codes into one and then reintroduced a tiny “No answer” bucket incorrectly.
- Ensure the original GSS codes for “don’t know” vs “no answer” are preserved distinctly when tabulating.

If you want, paste the code or the raw value labels you used for the attitude variable(s), and I can pinpoint the exact recoding/tabulation step that caused the systematic “No answer → Don’t know” shift.
