Score: 64/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: missing rows in the Generated Results
Your generated table **omits two response categories** that are present in the true table:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the generated output, both rows appear, but they are incorrectly filled with **0 for every genre**, which is not true.

**How to fix**
- Populate these two rows with the correct nonzero counts (shown in the True Results for each genre).
- Do *not* treat missing responses as zero; they are legitimate categories with their own frequencies.

---

### 2) Frequency count mismatches: every mismatch by cell
All “(1) Like very much” through “(5) Dislike very much” counts **match perfectly** between generated and true tables for all 18 genres.

The **only frequency mismatches** are in the two missing-data rows, where Generated uses all zeros but True has nonzero values.

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** — Generated 0s, True values:
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer** — Generated 0s, True values:
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** — True values:
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer** — True values:
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** — True values:
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer** — True values:
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- Replace the generated zeros with these true counts.
- If your pipeline auto-filled missing categories with 0, change it to **include the missing-response codes as valid categories** when tabulating.

---

### 3) Column items/categories: name/structure mismatches
There is one **labeling/structure discrepancy** in the header for “New Age/Space” vs “Opera”:

- **True table** separates them into two columns: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**.
- **Generated table** shows two separate columns but labels them oddly as:
  - **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** *combined* into **“New Age/Space Opera”** (looks like a single combined label),
  - yet the data clearly behave as **two distinct columns** (one for New Age/Space and one for Opera).

You can see this because the generated header shows: `New Age/Space Opera` and then later the counts appear under two adjacent positions matching the true **New Age/Space** and **Opera** columns (e.g., Like very much = 48 and 73).

**How to fix**
- Correct the header so it reads as **two separate column labels**:
  - `New Age/Space` and `Opera`
- Ensure the table rendering doesn’t concatenate adjacent column names.

---

### 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)
**Means:** All means in the generated table match the true table exactly.

**But**: If you compute means yourself from the frequency table, the presence/absence of the missing categories matters:
- Typically, the mean should be computed **excluding** missing categories `(M)` (as is standard), using only responses 1–5.
- Your generated output *looks like* it computed the mean correctly (since it matches True), but the displayed frequency table is inconsistent because it shows missing categories as zero.

**How to fix**
- Keep the mean computation aligned with the true method (likely excluding M categories).
- But also **display the correct M-category frequencies** so the table is internally consistent.

---

### 5) Percentages: missing entirely (cannot be “matched”)
You asked to compare percentages too, but:
- Neither the Generated nor the True tables provide **percentages**, only counts and means.

**How to fix (if percentages are required)**
- Add percentage columns or parenthetical percentages computed as:
  - `% = count / (sum of all categories including M?)`
- Decide denominator explicitly:
  - **All responses including M** (total N for that genre), or
  - **Valid only (1–5)**.
- The true table as shown does not include them, so to “match” it, you should **not add percentages** unless your target output requires them.

---

## Net: What must change for Generated to match True
1. **Replace all-zero rows** for:
   - `(M) Don’t know much about it`
   - `(M) No answer`
   with the true nonzero counts (listed above).
2. **Fix the column header** so `New Age/Space` and `Opera` are clearly separate (avoid the merged-looking “New Age/Space Opera” label).
3. Keep the means as they are (they already match), but ensure your frequency table includes the missing categories so the presentation is consistent with the true table.
