Score: 76/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing rows in the generated table

### Problem
Your **Generated Results omit two attitude rows** that are present in the True Results for *every* genre:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the generated table, both rows are included but incorrectly set to **0 for all genres**.

### Fix
Populate those two rows with the correct counts from the True table (listed below in section 2). Do **not** leave them as zeros.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

### A) Rows (1)–(5): Like/Dislike categories
For categories **(1) Like very much** through **(5) Dislike very much**, the generated counts **match exactly** the True Results for all 18 genres.

So there are **no mismatches** in those five rows.

### B) “(M) Don’t know much about it” row
**Generated:** all zeros  
**True:** nonzero counts for every genre  
So this is a mismatch for **all 18 genres**.

Correct values (True table):

- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

### C) “(M) No answer” row
**Generated:** all zeros  
**True:** nonzero counts for every genre  
So this is also a mismatch for **all 18 genres**.

Correct values (True table):

- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

## 3) Column/category mismatches (missing/extra columns or incorrect names)

### Problem: “New Age/Space Opera” is incorrectly combined into one column
In the generated header, you have:

- **“New Age/Space Opera”** (as a single column)

But the True table has **two separate genres/columns**:

- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

### Why this matters
Although the generated table contains numbers for both “New Age/Space” and “Opera” (they appear as two adjacent number-columns: e.g., 48 and 73 under “Like very much”), the **labeling is wrong**: it makes it look like one genre rather than two, and shifts interpretation.

### Fix
Split/rename the columns so they align to the True Results:

- Column should be **New Age/Space**
- Next column should be **Opera**

Everything else (other column names and count columns) matches the True table.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The **Mean** row in the generated table matches the True Results for all 18 genres **exactly**.

No mean-value corrections are needed.

### But: implied totals/sample size are wrong if you keep M rows as zero
Even though the mean values match, setting missing categories to zero causes a mismatch in the *distribution totals* (i.e., N per genre). The True table includes respondents in the two M categories, so each genre’s total count is:

- Sum of (1)–(5) **plus** Don’t know **plus** No answer.

### Fix
Once you insert the correct M-category counts, your per-genre totals will match the True table (and any derived percentages will be correct).

---

## 5) Percentages
Neither table shows percentages, but your prompt asks to compare them. Since the generated table omits the “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts (sets them to 0), **any percentages computed from the generated table will be wrong** (denominator too small and category shares inflated for (1)–(5)).

### Fix
- First correct the two M rows (section 2).
- Then compute percentages using the **full total N per genre** (including M categories).

---

# Summary of every mismatch
1) **Two rows are wrong for every genre**:  
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it” (all 18 genres)  
   - “(M) No answer” (all 18 genres)  
   Generated shows 0; True shows nonzero counts.

2) **One column label is wrong / columns improperly combined**:  
   - Generated “New Age/Space Opera” should be **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.

Everything else (rows (1)–(5) counts and the mean row) matches the True table.
