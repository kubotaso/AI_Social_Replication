Score: 72/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories: **mismatches and missing rows**

### A. Missing attitude categories in the Generated Results
The **true table has 8 rows** per genre block:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

Your **generated output shows 8 numeric rows**, but the **category labels are missing** and—more importantly—**rows 6 and 7 are wrong**:

- Generated row 6 is **all zeros** (this row should be “Don’t know much about it” and is **not zero** anywhere in the true table).
- Generated row 7 contains large counts that appear to be “Don’t know much about it” values for some genres, but they don’t match the true values and it entirely omits the separate “No answer” row.

**How to fix**
- Add explicit row labels and ensure you output **both missing-data categories separately**:
  - `(M) Don’t know much about it`
  - `(M) No answer`
- Remove the all-zero row; it does not exist in the true table.

## 2) Frequency counts: every mismatch

Rows (1)–(5) and Mean are correct; the errors are entirely in the missing-data rows.

Below, I compare the **true vs generated** for the missing categories.

### A. Latin/Salsa … Classical/Chamber (first block)

**(M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE vs GENERATED**
- Latin/Salsa: **221 vs 0** (missing)
- Jazz: **38 vs 0**
- Blues/R&B: **56 vs 0**
- Show Tunes: **77 vs 0**
- Oldies: **41 vs 0**
- Classical/Chamber: **66 vs 0**

Your generated row 7 has values for these columns:
- Latin/Salsa **233** (should be **221**)
- Jazz **53** (should be **38**)
- Blues/R&B **68** (should be **56**)
- Show Tunes **91** (should be **77**)
- Oldies **51** (should be **41**)
- Classical/Chamber **77** (should be **66**)

So: row 6 is wrong (zeros), and row 7 is also wrong (inflated counts).

**(M) No answer — TRUE vs GENERATED**
True has:
- Latin/Salsa **12**, Jazz **15**, Blues/R&B **12**, Show Tunes **14**, Oldies **10**, Classical/Chamber **11**

Generated output has **no row containing these**. They are completely missing.

**Fix**
- Replace the all-zero row with the correct “Don’t know much about it” row values (221, 38, 56, 77, 41, 66).
- Add an additional row for “No answer” (12, 15, 12, 14, 10, 11).
- Correct the currently mis-stated “don’t know” values (generated row 7) to match true counts.

### B. Reggae … Folk (second block)

**(M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE vs GENERATED**
True:
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

Generated row 6 is zeros; generated row 7 contains:
- Reggae **306** (should be **295**)
- Swing/Big Band **176** (should be **164**)
- New Age/Space **306** (should be **292**)
- Opera **96** (should be **83**)
- Bluegrass **174** (should be **163**)
- Folk **90** (should be **78**)

**(M) No answer — TRUE vs GENERATED**
True:
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

Generated has **no corresponding row**.

**Fix**
- Output the correct “Don’t know much about it” counts (295, 164, 292, 83, 163, 78).
- Add the missing “No answer” row (11, 12, 14, 13, 11, 12).

---

### C. Pop/Easy Listening … Gospel (third block)

**(M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE vs GENERATED**
True:
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

Generated row 6 is zeros; generated row 7 contains:
- Pop/Easy Listening **85** (should be **72**)
- Contemporary Rock **62** (should be **50**)
- Rap **72** (should be **61**)
- Heavy Metal **80** (should be **70**)
- Country/Western **32** (should be **22**)
- Gospel **47** (should be **35**)

**(M) No answer — TRUE vs GENERATED**
True:
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

Generated has **no such row**.

**Fix**
- Replace row 6 with correct “Don’t know” values.
- Add “No answer” row with the true values above.

## 3) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.): mismatches

### Means
The **Mean row in Generated Results matches the True Results** (to shown rounding) for all genres:
- e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ 3.14, Jazz 2.60528 ≈ 2.61, etc.

So **no mean mismatches**.

### Implied totals / N consistency (important discrepancy)
Because the “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” rows are wrong/missing, the **total responses per genre** implied by the generated table will not match the true table.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total = 85+325+416+403+144+0+233 = **1606** (accidentally matches here, but for the wrong reason: 233 is absorbing both missing categories and is still incorrect because the split is wrong—221 and 12.)
For other genres, totals may or may not coincidentally match; but the *category distribution* is incorrect everywhere.

**Fix**
- Ensure missing categories are counted separately and correctly; then (optionally) verify each column sums to the same N as the true table.

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns (genres)
Your generated output includes all 18 genres shown in the true frequency table:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

So there are **no extra/missing genre columns**.

### Row-label column missing
The true table includes an **“Attitude”** column with category labels; the generated output does not.

**Fix**
- Add the “Attitude” label column and ensure row order matches the true table exactly.

## 5) What you should change to make Generated match True (exactly)

1. **Add row labels** in this order:
   - (1) Like very much  
   - (2) Like it  
   - (3) Mixed feelings  
   - (4) Dislike it  
   - (5) Dislike very much  
   - (M) Don’t know much about it  
   - (M) No answer  
   - Mean  

2. **Replace the all-zero row** with the correct “Don’t know much about it” counts from the true table (by genre).

3. **Add a new row** for “No answer” with the true counts (by genre).

4. **Correct the currently misreported “Don’t know…” values** (your last-but-one numeric row) to equal the true “Don’t know…” row, not the inflated numbers you have now.

If you want, paste your underlying computation code (or how you constructed those last two rows), and I can point out the precise logic error (e.g., treating both missing categories as one, mis-parsing “M”, or shifting rows during concatenation).
