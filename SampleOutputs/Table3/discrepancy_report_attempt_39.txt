Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing attitude rows in the Generated Results
In the **Generated Results**, the following rows are present but incorrectly filled with zeros across all genres:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the **True Results**, these rows have **nonzero counts for every genre**.

**Fix:** Populate these two “M” rows with the correct counts from the True table (listed below in section 2). Do *not* set them to 0.

### B. Column/category naming mismatch: “New Age/Space Opera”
The Generated column header is **“New Age/Space Opera”**, which incorrectly merges two separate genre labels.

In the True Results (Panel 2), these are two distinct columns:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

**Fix:** Split “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”, and use the correct counts/means for each.

### C. Incorrect number of genre columns
Because the Generated table merges “New Age/Space” and “Opera” into one, it has **17 genre columns** instead of the **18** in the True table.

**Fix:** Add the missing separate **Opera** column (or split the merged one), restoring **18** total genres.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

All non-missing response categories **(1)–(5)** match the True Results **for every genre** (the numbers shown are identical).  
The mismatches are entirely in the **(M)** rows (and the merged column issue).

### A. (M) Don’t know much about it — Generated shows 0, True has counts

Replace the Generated zeros with these True counts:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

### B. (M) No answer — Generated shows 0, True has counts

Replace the Generated zeros with these True counts:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
All **Mean** values shown in the Generated Results match the True Results **for the columns that exist**.

However, because the Generated table **merged “New Age/Space” and “Opera”**, it improperly implies a single mean for a combined category (and in practice you cannot have one mean for two different variables without recomputing from raw data).

**Fix:** After splitting the column, use:
- Mean(New Age/Space) = **3.68**
- Mean(Opera) = **3.48**

### Totals / N (implicit problem)
Even though no total N row is shown, setting the (M) categories to zero makes the implied sample size per genre incorrectly smaller than in the True table.

**Fix:** Once you restore the correct (M) counts, the per-genre totals will align with the True distribution.

---

## 4) Missing/extra column categories

### Missing column: Opera (as a separate genre)
Opera is **missing as its own column** and incorrectly embedded in “New Age/Space Opera”.

**Fix:** Add **Opera** as its own column and rename the other to **New Age/Space**.

No other genre columns are missing or extra; the remaining genre labels match the True table.

---

## 5) Percentages
Neither table displays percentages—only counts and means. So:
- There are **no percentage mismatches to check**
- If your generated analysis was supposed to include percentages, they are **missing entirely**

**Fix (if needed):** Compute percentages within each genre using the correct totals (including both M categories), then display them consistently.

---

### Minimal set of corrections to make Generated match True
1. **Split** “New Age/Space Opera” into **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.
2. Replace the all-zero **(M) Don’t know much about it** row with the correct counts for each genre.
3. Replace the all-zero **(M) No answer** row with the correct counts for each genre.
4. Ensure the **means** are reported for the two separate columns (3.68 and 3.48).
