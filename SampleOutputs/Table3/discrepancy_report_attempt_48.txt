## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### Mismatch: Missing rows in the **Generated Results**
Your generated frequency table includes only **5 attitude categories + 2 all-zero rows + Mean** (8 rows total), but the true table has **7 response categories + Mean** (8 rows total):

True rows (in order):
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

Generated rows:
- Rows 1–5 match the five “Like/Dislike” categories.
- Rows 6–7 are present but are **all zeros** across every genre.
- Row 8 is Mean.

**What’s wrong:** The generated table **omits the actual “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts** and replaces them with two zero rows.

**Fix:** Replace the two zero rows with the correct missingness rows:
- Row 6 = “(M) Don’t know much about it” (nonzero counts)
- Row 7 = “(M) No answer” (nonzero counts)

Also add/keep the row labels explicitly so it’s clear what each row represents.

## 2) Frequency counts / percentages mismatches

### A) For the first 5 response categories: counts appear correct
For all 18 genres, the generated counts for:
- Like very much
- Like it
- Mixed feelings
- Dislike it
- Dislike very much

match the true table exactly (e.g., Latin/Salsa 85/325/416/403/144; Jazz 254/540/393/297/69; etc.).

### B) For the two missingness categories: **every value is wrong**
In the true table, “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” are **not zero**. The generated results set them to **0 for every genre**, which is incorrect.

Here are the true values that must replace the generated zeros:

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE counts
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### (M) No answer — TRUE counts
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Populate rows 6–7 with those values (and label them properly). If your workflow computed frequencies from a dataset, you likely:
- dropped missing categories, or
- recoded them to NA and then excluded them from tabulation, or
- used a function that defaults to `exclude = NULL/NA` without requesting missing counts.

In R, for example, you’d need something like:
- `table(x, useNA="ifany")` (if they are coded as NA), or
- ensure “Don’t know” / “No answer” are treated as valid factor levels and not converted to NA before tabulation.

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: match (minor formatting only)
Generated mean row matches the true means (differences only in rounding/formatting), e.g.:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 vs 3.14
- Jazz 2.60528 vs 2.61
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 vs 4.12

So the **mean values are correct**.

### But: your generated table is internally inconsistent if you treat zeros as real counts
If someone interpreted your rows 6–7 as real categories with 0 counts, then totals per genre would be wrong versus the true table. For example:

- **Latin/Salsa total (true)**  
  85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
- **Latin/Salsa total (generated, if zeros)**  
  85+325+416+403+144+0+0 = **1373**

So while the mean matches, the **frequency distribution is incomplete**, and any derived totals/percentages would be wrong.

**Fix:** After inserting correct “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts, recompute totals and (if included) percentages based on the proper denominator rules:
- If reporting distribution of *all responses*, include M categories in denominator.
- If reporting distribution of *substantive attitudes only*, exclude M categories and state that clearly.

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns (genres): match
All 18 genres present in the true table are present in the generated output, with correct names:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No extra or missing genre columns.

## 5) How to fix the generated analysis to match the true table

1) **Add correct row labels** in the generated output:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much
- (M) Don’t know much about it
- (M) No answer
- Mean

2) **Replace the two all-zero rows** with the true “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts (listed above).

3) If you will compute **percentages**, decide and document whether M categories are included in the denominator. Then compute accordingly (your current output has no percentages, but your instructions mention them).

That’s the complete set of mismatches: the only substantive errors are the two missingness categories being zero/absent; everything else (genres, first five frequency rows, means) aligns with the true table.
