Score: 62/100
============================================================

## 1) Wrong table entirely (major row/category mismatch)
**Generated Results** are a numeric matrix for **18 music genres** with 8 rows (5 attitude rows + 2 all-NaN rows + mean row).  
**True Results** contain **three separate tables**:
- **Table 1:** Regression coefficients (SES/Demographic/Political intolerance models)
- **Table 2:** Regression coefficients (racism + demographics)
- **Table 3:** Frequency distributions for **18 genres** (the only part that corresponds to your generated matrix)

### How to fix
- If you intended to reproduce the *frequency table*, the output should be labeled as **Table 3**, not mixed with Tables 1–2.
- If you intended to reproduce Tables 1–2, the generated output is completely wrong (wrong variables, wrong structure, wrong values). You’d need to generate regression coefficient tables instead of genre frequencies.

---

## 2) Row items/categories: missing categories and incorrect “NaN” rows
### True Table 3 has **8 rows per genre**:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

### Generated table has:
- 5 numeric rows (which match rows 1–5)
- then **two rows of NaN**
- then the mean row

Those two NaN rows correspond to **missing “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts**, but instead of counts they’re empty.

### How to fix
Replace the two NaN rows with the correct counts from the true table:

**(M) Don’t know much about it** (must be a full numeric row across all 18 genres):
- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66  
- Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35

**(M) No answer** (full numeric row across all 18 genres):
- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11  
- Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12

Also add row labels (currently missing in the generated output).

---

## 3) Column items/categories: genres match, but structure/labeling differs
### Genres (columns)
The generated columns include all 18 genres and their names match the true table (no missing/extra genres).

### But: missing “Attitude” column / row labels
The true table includes an “Attitude” descriptor column and explicit response labels; the generated output omits those, making it ambiguous.

### How to fix
Add an **Attitude** index/column with the 8 row labels shown above.

---

## 4) Frequency counts: rows (1)–(5) match; missing rows (M) are wrong
For the **five explicit attitude categories (1)–(5)**, the generated counts **match exactly** the true table for every genre shown.

The only frequency-count mismatches are:
- The two missing-category rows are **NaN instead of the true counts** (see section 2).

### How to fix
Insert the correct numeric rows for “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” instead of NaN.

---

## 5) Percentages: missing entirely
The user request includes “counts or percentages.” The **true table provides counts (not percentages)**, and the **generated table provides counts (and mean) but no percentages**.

### How to fix (only if you intended to include percentages)
- Compute percentages using the correct denominator.
- Important: Because there are “Don’t know” and “No answer” categories, you must decide whether percentages are:
  - out of **all responses including missing**, or
  - out of **valid attitudes only (1)–(5)**.
Then add columns/rows accordingly. (The true table does not do this, so leaving percentages out is also acceptable if you’re matching Table 3.)

---

## 6) Summary statistics (means): essentially match; rounding/precision differs
The generated mean row:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 vs true 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 vs true 2.61  
- etc.

These are **not mismatches in value**, just **formatting/rounding** (generated shows many decimals; true shows two decimals).

### How to fix
Round means to **2 decimal places** to match the true table presentation.

---

## 7) Missing “Table 1” and “Table 2” outputs (if you intended to reproduce the full “True Results”)
If your goal was to match the entire “True Results” block, the generated output is missing:
- all regression rows/columns for Table 1 and Table 2 (Education, income, coefficients, R², N, significance stars, etc.)

### How to fix
Generate separate regression summary tables with:
- the same dependent variable definition,
- the same models/columns,
- the same coefficients and fit statistics,
- and the same sample sizes.

---

### Minimal correction checklist to make the generated frequency table match True Table 3
1. Add row labels for the 8 attitude/summary rows.  
2. Replace the two NaN rows with the correct (M) counts (“Don’t know…” and “No answer”) for all 18 genres.  
3. Round means to 2 decimals.  
4. (Optional) Format as three subtables of 6 genres each, as in the true table.
