Score: 79/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names/number of items)

### A. The “Opera” column is mis-labeled/merged in the generated header
- **True table (Panel 2)** has **two separate columns**:  
  **New Age/Space** and **Opera**
- **Generated header** shows **one combined column**:  
  **“New Age/Space Opera”** (looks like “New Age/Space” + “Opera” got concatenated into one header)

**How to fix**
- Split that generated column into **two distinct columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- Then ensure each gets the correct frequencies (see Section 2B below).  
  (Right now the generated frequencies under that merged header match *New Age/Space*, while *Opera* counts are incorrectly placed into the next column.)

### B. The row labels are otherwise present and in the right order
Rows included match the true table’s 7 response categories plus Mean:
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
(M) Don’t know much about it  
(M) No answer  
Mean

So the **row set itself is fine**; the major structural issue is the **Opera column handling**.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (cell-by-cell)

All mismatches occur in the **“(M) Don’t know much about it”** and **“(M) No answer”** rows (plus one knock-on header/placement issue around Opera). The first five attitude categories and the Means match the true values.

### A. Panel 1 columns (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — Generated vs True
- **Latin/Salsa:** 175 vs **221** (wrong)
- **Jazz:** 40 vs **38** (wrong)
- **Blues/R&B:** 51 vs **56** (wrong)
- **Show Tunes:** 68 vs **77** (wrong)
- **Oldies:** 38 vs **41** (wrong)
- **Classical/Chamber:** 58 vs **66** (wrong)

#### (M) No answer — Generated vs True
- **Latin/Salsa:** 58 vs **12** (wrong)
- **Jazz:** 13 vs **15** (wrong)
- **Blues/R&B:** 17 vs **12** (wrong)
- **Show Tunes:** 23 vs **14** (wrong)
- **Oldies:** 13 vs **10** (wrong)
- **Classical/Chamber:** 19 vs **11** (wrong)

**How to fix (Panel 1)**
- Replace the generated “Don’t know…” and “No answer” counts with the true counts above.
- Do not change the first five rows or Mean—they already match.

---

### B. Panel 2 columns (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — Generated vs True
- **Reggae:** 230 vs **295** (wrong)
- **Swing/Big Band:** 132 vs **164** (wrong)
- **New Age/Space:** 230 vs **292** (wrong)  
  (Also impacted by the header merge issue—see below.)
- **Opera:** 72 vs **83** (wrong)
- **Bluegrass:** 130 vs **163** (wrong)
- **Folk:** 68 vs **78** (wrong)

#### (M) No answer — Generated vs True
- **Reggae:** 76 vs **11** (wrong)
- **Swing/Big Band:** 44 vs **12** (wrong)
- **New Age/Space:** 76 vs **14** (wrong)
- **Opera:** 24 vs **13** (wrong)
- **Bluegrass:** 44 vs **11** (wrong)
- **Folk:** 22 vs **12** (wrong)

**Header/placement problem affecting Opera**
- The generated header merges **New Age/Space + Opera** into one column label.
- The generated counts in the first five rows for that merged column are: 48, 186, 269, 429, 368 — these match **New Age/Space** in the true table.
- The next column in the generated table is labeled **Bluegrass**, but its first five rows are 73, 257, 359, 515, 306 — those are actually **Opera** values in the true table.

**How to fix (Panel 2)**
1. Rename columns correctly and shift data:
   - The column currently labeled **Bluegrass** (with 73/257/359/515/306) must be relabeled to **Opera**.
   - Insert/restore a **Bluegrass** column using the true Bluegrass counts (145/562/411/255/59 etc.).
2. Correct “Don’t know…” and “No answer” rows to:
   - Reggae: 295 / 11
   - Swing/Big Band: 164 / 12
   - New Age/Space: 292 / 14
   - Opera: 83 / 13
   - Bluegrass: 163 / 11
   - Folk: 78 / 12

### C. Panel 3 columns (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — Generated vs True
- **Pop/Easy Listening:** 64 vs **72** (wrong)
- **Contemporary Rock:** 46 vs **50** (wrong)
- **Rap:** 54 vs **61** (wrong)
- **Heavy Metal:** 60 vs **70** (wrong)
- **Country/Western:** 24 vs **22** (wrong)
- **Gospel:** 35 vs **35** (correct)

#### (M) No answer — Generated vs True
- **Pop/Easy Listening:** 21 vs **13** (wrong)
- **Contemporary Rock:** 16 vs **12** (wrong)
- **Rap:** 18 vs **11** (wrong)
- **Heavy Metal:** 20 vs **10** (wrong)
- **Country/Western:** 8 vs **10** (wrong)
- **Gospel:** 12 vs **12** (correct)

**How to fix (Panel 3)**
- Replace “Don’t know…” and “No answer” with the true values above (leaving the first five rows and Means unchanged).

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means/totals/etc.)

### Means
- **All generated Means match the true table**, including:
  - Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Heavy Metal 4.12, etc.
- No fixes needed for Mean values.

### Totals / N checks (implied issue)
Although the prompt doesn’t show totals, the incorrect “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts imply that **column totals (N per genre)** in the generated table will not match the true totals. After correcting those two rows, each genre column total will align with the true table’s underlying N.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing/extra due to merged header
- **True:** separate **New Age/Space** and **Opera**
- **Generated:** merged **“New Age/Space Opera”** and then misaligns subsequent columns (Opera data appears under “Bluegrass”)

**How to fix**
- Ensure the generated output has **18 distinct genre columns** with exactly these names:
  Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber; Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk; Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel

---

## 5) What to change to make the generated analysis match the true table (action list)

1. **Split the merged “New Age/Space Opera” header into two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.
2. **Realign the data** so:
   - New Age/Space gets: 48, 186, 269, 429, 368, 292, 14
   - Opera gets: 73, 257, 359, 515, 306, 83, 13
3. **Replace every incorrect value in the last two rows** (“Don’t know much about it” and “No answer”) with the true counts for all genres (as detailed above).
4. Leave the **first five attitude rows and all Means** as-is (they already match the true table).
