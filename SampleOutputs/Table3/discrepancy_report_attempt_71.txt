Score: 62/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatched (names + number of items)

### A. Missing response categories in the Generated Results
The **true table has 8 rows** per genre:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

The **generated table only has 8 rows too**, but rows **6 and 7 are wrong**:
- Row 6 in Generated corresponds to **“Don’t know much about it”** but the values are mostly incorrect.
- Row 7 in Generated is **all zeros**, but in the True table **“No answer” is nonzero for every genre**.

**Fix:** Add/restore the two missing “M” rows properly:
- Replace the all-zero row with the correct **“(M) No answer”** counts.
- Correct the **“(M) Don’t know much about it”** row counts.

### B. Row labels are missing in Generated Results
Generated output shows only numbers, no labels for:
- Like very much, Like it, Mixed, Dislike, Dislike very much, Don’t know, No answer, Mean.

**Fix:** Include row labels exactly as in the true table.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre and category)

All “Like very much” through “Dislike very much” rows (rows 1–5) **match the True table for all 18 genres**.

All **means** (last row) also match (allowing for rounding/extra decimals).

The mismatches are entirely in the **(M) rows**.

### A. “Don’t know much about it” row (Generated row 6) — incorrect values

#### Latin/Salsa
- Generated: **233**

#### Rap
- Generated: **72**
- True: **61**
- **Fix:** 72 → 61

#### Heavy Metal
- Generated: **80**
- True: **70**
- **Fix:** 80 → 70

#### Country/Western

- True: **22**
- **Fix:** 32 → 22

#### Gospel
- Generated: **47**
- True: **35**
- **Fix:** 47 → 35

**Summary:** The generated “Don’t know much about it” counts are wrong for **all 18 genres**.

---

### B. “No answer” row — completely wrong/missing
Generated row 7 is:
- **all zeros** for all genres

True table “(M) No answer” values are:

- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the all-zero row with these nonzero counts.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
Generated mean row matches the true means for all genres (minor formatting differences only), e.g.:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ **3.14**
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ **2.61**
- etc.

**No fixes needed** for mean values (only optional rounding/formatting).

### Totals / N
The generated output does not show totals, but you can detect an issue:
- Because the **“Don’t know”** and **“No answer”** rows are wrong, any computed totals per genre or any derived percentages would be wrong too.

**Fix:** After correcting both M rows, recompute:
- Total N per genre (sum of all response categories including M categories, consistent with the true table’s underlying sample for that item)
- Percentages if you are reporting them.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns (genres)
Generated includes the same **18 genres** as the true Table 3:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No extra/missing genre columns detected.

**Fix:** None needed for column set—only ensure the table is grouped/labelled like the true table if presentation must match (the true table is split into three subtables of 6 genres each).

---

## How to fix the generated analysis to match the true table (exact steps)

1. **Add row labels** for the 8 attitude categories (including the two M categories).
2. **Replace the entire “Don’t know much about it” row** with the correct true counts (all 18 values listed above).
3. **Replace the all-zero row** with the correct **“No answer”** counts (all 18 values listed above).
4. If you report **percentages**, recompute them using the corrected counts (and decide whether percentages are of total including M categories or excluding them—match the true table’s convention if stated).
5. Keep the mean row as-is (optionally round to 2 decimals to match the true table formatting).

If you want, paste the code or process that produced the generated table, and I can pinpoint why the M rows were shifted/miscalculated (common causes: treating missing codes as 0, dropping “no answer” but still leaving a placeholder row, or mis-mapping value labels for missing categories).
