Score: 73/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: missing vs. present

**Mismatch:** In the *Generated Results*, the rows  
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
- **(M) No answer**  
are included but set to **0 for every genre**.

**True table:** Those two rows are **not zero**; they contain nonzero counts for every genre (all three panels).

**Fix:** Populate those two rows with the correct nonzero counts from the true table (listed in Section 2 below). Do not leave them as zeros.

---

### 2) Frequency counts: every incorrect cell (systematic error)

All counts for response options **(1)–(5)** match the true table across all 18 genres.

**The only frequency-count mismatches are that the Generated table sets all “missing” categories to 0.** Concretely:

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Latin/Salsa **221** (not 0)
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the 0s in the Generated table with the above counts.

---

### 3) Column categories: missing/extra or naming issues

**Mismatch (labeling/structure):** The *Generated Results* header combines **“New Age/Space Opera”** into one column label, implying a single genre, while the *True Results* show:
- **New Age/Space** (one genre)
- **Opera** (a separate genre)

However, the Generated table **does** include **Opera** as its own column (it appears as the next column label “Opera”), so the issue is **column naming/formatting**, not missing data.

**Fix:** Rename the header to match the true table:
- Change **“New Age/Space Opera”** → **“New Age/Space”**
- Keep **“Opera”** as a separate column.

(Your underlying counts for New Age/Space and Opera already match the true table for rows (1)–(5); the main data problem is still the missing-category zeros.)

---

### 4) Percentages: missing outputs

**Mismatch:** Your prompt asks to compare “frequency counts or percentages,” but the Generated table contains **counts only** (no percentages). The True table also shows counts only, so **there is no numerical mismatch**, but **percentages are absent** in the Generated output if they were expected.

**Fix (if percentages are required):**
- Compute column percentages using the correct denominator.
- Important: decide whether percentages should be based on **all responses including missing (M)** or **valid responses only (1–5)**, and state it. If you include missing, you must first fix the missing-category counts (Section 2), otherwise percentages will be wrong.

---

### 5) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** The “Mean” row in Generated Results matches the True table for every genre **as displayed**.

**But there is a consistency problem:** If you truly have **0** in both missing rows, then the implied total N per genre in the Generated table would be smaller than in the True table, yet the mean is unchanged. That indicates the Generated output is internally inconsistent (means appear copied from the true table while missing counts were incorrectly zeroed).

**Fix:** Once you insert the correct missing-category counts, the mean row will be consistent with the full distribution as in the true table.

---

## Bottom line: what to change so Generated matches True
1. **Fill in (M) Don’t know much about it** counts for all 18 genres (replace zeros with true values).
2. **Fill in (M) No answer** counts for all 18 genres (replace zeros with true values).
3. **Correct the column header**: split/rename so it reads **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** separately (not “New Age/Space Opera”).
4. (Optional, if required) add **percentages** using a clearly defined denominator (all responses vs. valid only), after fixing missing counts.
