Score: 56/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names/number of items)

**True Table 3 has 8 rows per genre:**
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean

**Generated table has 8 numeric rows, but rows 6–7 are wrong:**
- **Row 6 in the generated output is not “Don’t know much about it”**; it contains values that *don’t match* the “Don’t know” row in the true table.
- **Row 7 in the generated output is all zeros**, but it should be **“No answer”** counts (nonzero in the true table for every genre).

**Fix**
- Label rows explicitly and populate them with the correct counts for:
  - “Don’t know much about it”
  - “No answer”
- Remove the all-zero row and replace it with the correct “No answer” counts.

---

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

Rows 1–5 (**Like very much** through **Dislike very much**) and the **Mean** row match the true table for all genres.  
All mismatches are concentrated in the missing-data categories:

#### A) “Don’t know much about it” row (Generated row 6) — incorrect for *every* genre

Below are **Generated vs True** for that row:

**Latin/Salsa:** 233 vs **221** (off by +12)  
**Jazz:** 53 vs **38** (off by +15)  
**Blues/R&B:** 68 vs **56** (off by +12)  
**Show Tunes:** 91 vs **77** (off by +14)  
**Oldies:** 51 vs **41** (off by +10)  
**Classical/Chamber:** 77 vs **66** (off by +11)  

**Reggae:** 306 vs **295** (off by +11)  
**Swing/Big Band:** 176 vs **164** (off by +12)  
**New Age/Space:** 306 vs **292** (off by +14)  
**Opera:** 96 vs **83** (off by +13)  
**Bluegrass:** 174 vs **163** (off by +11)  
**Folk:** 90 vs **78** (off by +12)  

**Pop/Easy Listening:** 85 vs **72** (off by +13)  
**Contemporary Rock:** 62 vs **50** (off by +12)  
**Rap:** 72 vs **61** (off by +11)  
**Heavy Metal:** 80 vs **70** (off by +10)  
**Country/Western:** 32 vs **22** (off by +10)  
**Gospel:** 47 vs **35** (off by +12)

**What’s happening:** these “Don’t know” values look like they were incorrectly computed/shifted (they’re consistently too large) and appear to be contaminated by the “No answer” counts (see next).

**Fix**
- Replace the entire generated row 6 with the true “Don’t know much about it” counts shown in Table 3.

#### B) “No answer” row (Generated row 7) — completely wrong (all zeros)

True “No answer” values are:

- Latin/Salsa **12**, Jazz **15**, Blues/R&B **12**, Show Tunes **14**, Oldies **10**, Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**, Swing/Big Band **12**, New Age/Space **14**, Opera **13**, Bluegrass **11**, Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**, Contemporary Rock **12**, Rap **11**, Heavy Metal **10**, Country/Western **10**, Gospel **12**

**Fix**
- Populate row 7 with these counts (and label it “(M) No answer”).

---

### 3) Percentages

**True Table 3 reports counts only (plus means)**—it does **not** include percentages.  
The generated table also does **not** show percentages, so there’s no percentage mismatch to audit. If your generated analysis elsewhere included percentages, you must compute them using the correct denominators (and decide whether to include/exclude missing categories).

**Fix (if you need percentages)**
- Specify denominator clearly:
  - **Option A:** out of all cases including missing categories  
  - **Option B:** out of valid responses only (1–5), excluding the two (M) categories  
- Then compute per genre accordingly.

---

### 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** The mean row in the generated output matches the true means for all 18 genres (to the displayed precision).

**Implied totals check (reveals the source of the row-6/row-7 error):**
- In the true table, for each genre:  
  **Total = (1–5) + Don’t know + No answer**
- In the generated table, row 7 is zero, and row 6 is inflated.  
  For many genres, **Generated row6 ≈ True (Don’t know + No answer)**. Example:
  - Latin/Salsa: True Don’t know 221 + No answer 12 = **233** = generated row 6  
  - Jazz: 38 + 15 = **53** = generated row 6  
  - Show Tunes: 77 + 14 = **91** = generated row 6  
  - Opera: 83 + 13 = **96** = generated row 6  
This pattern holds across all columns.

So the generated analysis appears to have **collapsed both missing categories into one** (“Don’t know”), and then **set “No answer” to 0**.

**Fix**
- Split missing values into **two distinct categories**:
  - Don’t know much about it
  - No answer  
- Do not sum them into one row.

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories

**Columns (genre names):** Generated includes the same 18 genres as the true table; no extra/missing genre columns.

**But the true results also contain Table 1 and Table 2 (regression tables)** which are **entirely absent** from the generated output.
- If the intention was to reproduce the *full “true results” document*, the generated output is missing Tables 1–2 completely.
- If the intention was only Table 3, then the column set is fine.

**Fix**
- Clarify scope:
  - If you must match the entire true results, add Tables 1 and 2 with the correct coefficients, R², adjusted R², and N.
  - If only Table 3 is required, keep the 18 genre columns but correct the two missing-data rows.

---

## Concrete correction required to match Table 3 exactly

Replace the generated last three rows with:

- Row 6 (“Don’t know much about it”): use the **true** Don’t know counts (not Don’t know + No answer).
- Row 7 (“No answer”): use the **true** No answer counts (nonzero).
- Keep the Mean row as-is.

That single change fixes **every** mismatch between the generated and true frequency table for the 18 genres.
