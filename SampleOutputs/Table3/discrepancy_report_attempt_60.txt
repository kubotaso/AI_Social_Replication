## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing “(M) No answer” counts (all genres)
- **Generated:** “(M) No answer” row is present but **all zeros** for every genre.
- **True:** “(M) No answer” has **nonzero counts for every genre** (ranging from 10–15 depending on genre).

**Fix:** Replace the generated “(M) No answer” row with the true counts:

- **Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber):**  
  - Latin/Salsa **12**, Jazz **15**, Blues/R&B **12**, Show Tunes **14**, Oldies **10**, Classical/Chamber **11**
- **Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk):**  
  - Reggae **11**, Swing/Big Band **12**, New Age/Space **14**, Opera **13**, Bluegrass **11**, Folk **12**
- **Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel):**  
  - Pop/Easy Listening **13**, Contemporary Rock **12**, Rap **11**, Heavy Metal **10**, Country/Western **10**, Gospel **12**

### B. Column/category labeling issue: “New Age/Space Opera”
- **Generated:** A single column labeled **“New Age/Space Opera”**.
- **True:** Two separate columns: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** (Panel 2).

**Fix:** Split the generated combined label into **two distinct columns**:
- Rename “New Age/Space Opera” → **New Age/Space**
- Ensure there is a separate **Opera** column (which you *do* have as “Opera” in the generated header, but the “New Age/Space Opera” label is misleading and implies they were merged).

(Your generated *values* appear to correspond to **New Age/Space** and **Opera** separately, but the header text is incorrect.)

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

All rows **(1) through (5)** match the true table for every genre.

The mismatches occur in the **(M) Don’t know much about it** row and the **(M) No answer** row.

### A. “(M) Don’t know much about it” mismatches

#### Panel 1 (6 genres): all 6 are wrong
| Genre | Generated DK | True DK | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Latin/Salsa | 233 | 221 | +12 |
| Jazz | 53 | 38 | +15 |
| Blues/R&B | 68 | 56 | +12 |
| Show Tunes | 91 | 77 | +14 |
| Oldies | 51 | 41 | +10 |
| Classical/Chamber | 77 | 66 | +11 |

**Pattern:** Each generated DK value equals **True DK + True No answer**.  
Example: Latin/Salsa 221 + 12 = 233.

**Fix:** Subtract the true “No answer” counts from the generated DK row (or directly replace DK with the true DK counts listed above), and then populate “No answer” correctly.

#### Panel 2 (6 genres): all 6 are wrong
| Genre | Generated DK | True DK | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Reggae | 306 | 295 | +11 |
| Swing/Big Band | 176 | 164 | +12 |
| New Age/Space | 306 | 292 | +14 |
| Opera | 96 | 83 | +13 |
| Bluegrass | 174 | 163 | +11 |
| Folk | 90 | 78 | +12 |

**Same pattern:** Generated DK = True DK + True No answer.

**Fix:** Replace with true DK values (or subtract the No answer counts and add them into the No answer row).

#### Panel 3 (6 genres): all 6 are wrong
| Genre | Generated DK | True DK | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Pop/Easy Listening | 85 | 72 | +13 |
| Contemporary Rock | 62 | 50 | +12 |
| Rap | 72 | 61 | +11 |
| Heavy Metal | 80 | 70 | +10 |
| Country/Western | 32 | 22 | +10 |
| Gospel | 47 | 35 | +12 |

**Same pattern again.**

**Fix:** Use true DK counts and restore No answer counts.

### B. “(M) No answer” mismatches

- **Generated:** all zeros.
- **True:** nonzero for every genre (given in Section 1A).

**Fix:** Insert the true “No answer” counts.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- **Generated means:** match the **true means** for all genres.

### Totals / implied N consistency (diagnostic)
Even though no explicit “Total” row is shown, your generated table implicitly preserves the correct overall N per genre **because** it incorrectly moved “No answer” cases into “Don’t know much about it.” That’s why:
- the **means still match** (means are calculated only on responses 1–5, and those rows are correct),
- but the **missing-data breakdown is wrong** (DK vs No answer).

**Fix (conceptual):**
- When producing the frequency table, treat **DK** and **No answer** as **separate categories**, not combined.
- Ensure your counting logic distinguishes:
  - “Don’t know much about it” (a substantive “M” category)
  - “No answer” (item nonresponse)

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

- **Generated:** includes 18 genres (correct count), but the header text **“New Age/Space Opera”** is incorrect because it conflates two labels.
- **True:** has 18 genres split across panels, explicitly separating **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.

**Fix:** Correct the column header(s) so there are clearly two columns:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

---

## What to change so the generated table matches the true table

1. **Replace the entire “(M) Don’t know much about it” row** with the true DK counts (listed above in the mismatch tables).
2. **Replace the entire “(M) No answer” row** with the true “No answer” counts (listed above).
3. **Fix the header label** “New Age/Space Opera” → separate/rename to match true labels:
   - “New Age/Space”
   - “Opera”

After these changes, every cell in the generated output will align with the true table.
