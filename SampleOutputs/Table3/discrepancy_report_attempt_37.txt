Score: 60/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches

#### A. Missing attitude rows in the Generated Results
The generated table **omits two response categories** that are present in the true table:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the generated output these rows exist but are incorrectly shown as **all zeros** for every genre.

**How to fix**
- Populate these two rows with the **correct nonzero frequencies** from the true table (listed below in section 2).
- Ensure your tabulation code includes these missing-value categories (i.e., does not drop them and does not recode them to 0).

#### B. Column/category mismatch: “New Age/Space Opera” vs true structure
The generated header contains **“New Age/Space Opera”** as a single column name, but the true table has two distinct genre columns:

- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

So the generated table **collapses/merges two separate columns into one mislabeled column**.

**How to fix**
- Split into two separate columns: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.
- Move the Opera counts currently appearing under “New Age/Space Opera” into the **Opera** column (or re-tabulate from the raw data using the correct variable(s) so the split is correct).

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by cell)

#### A. All “Don’t know much about it” counts are wrong
Generated shows 0 for all genres; true table has the following:

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)**
- Latin/Salsa: **221**
- Jazz: **38**
- Blues/R&B: **56**
- Show Tunes: **77**
- Oldies: **41**
- Classical/Chamber: **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)**
- Reggae: **295**
- Swing/Big Band: **164**
- New Age/Space: **292**
- Opera: **83**
- Bluegrass: **163**
- Folk: **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72**
- Contemporary Rock: **50**
- Rap: **61**
- Heavy Metal: **70**
- Country/Western: **22**
- Gospel: **35**

**Fix:** Replace the entire “Don’t know much about it” row with these values (and ensure Opera is its own column).

#### B. All “No answer” counts are wrong
Generated shows 0 for all genres; true table has:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa: **12**
- Jazz: **15**
- Blues/R&B: **12**
- Show Tunes: **14**
- Oldies: **10**
- Classical/Chamber: **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae: **11**
- Swing/Big Band: **12**
- New Age/Space: **14**
- Opera: **13**
- Bluegrass: **11**
- Folk: **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13**
- Contemporary Rock: **12**
- Rap: **11**
- Heavy Metal: **10**
- Country/Western: **10**
- Gospel: **12**

**Fix:** Replace the entire “No answer” row with these values (again, with Opera separated).

#### C. All other attitude-category counts match (for the rows shown)
For the five substantive categories:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  

…the generated frequencies **match the true table exactly** *for the genres that are correctly represented as separate columns*. The only structural problem is the **New Age/Space vs Opera** naming/merging issue.

---

### 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

#### Means
All printed means in the generated table **match the true table** for the corresponding genres.

However, because the generated table incorrectly shows **0** for the two “M” rows, this creates an **internal inconsistency**: the displayed category counts would sum to a different N than the true table’s implied N, even though the mean is correct.

**How to fix**
- Once you insert the correct “Don’t know…” and “No answer” frequencies, the means will be consistent with the full distribution shown.
- If your mean is computed excluding missing categories (likely), keep doing that—but the table must still display the missing-category counts correctly.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

#### Missing column: Opera (as its own genre)
The true table has **18 genres**, including **Opera** as a separate column.
The generated output effectively has **17 genre columns** because it combines **New Age/Space + Opera** (and also mislabels it).

**How to fix**
- Output 18 distinct columns exactly as in the true table:
  1. Latin/Salsa
  2. Jazz
  3. Blues/R&B
  4. Show Tunes
  5. Oldies
  6. Classical/Chamber
  7. Reggae
  8. Swing/Big Band
  9. New Age/Space
  10. **Opera**
  11. Bluegrass
  12. Folk
  13. Pop/Easy Listening
  14. Contemporary Rock
  15. Rap
  16. Heavy Metal
  17. Country/Western
  18. Gospel

## What to change in the generated analysis to match the true table (checklist)

1. **Do not set missing categories to 0.** Include real counts for:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it  
   - (M) No answer
2. **Separate “New Age/Space” and “Opera” into two columns** and label them correctly.
3. Keep the existing five substantive-category counts (they already match).
4. Re-run the tabulation ensuring:
   - missing-value codes are *counted as categories* for the frequency table
   - means are computed using the same rule as the true table (typically excluding missing categories)

If you want, paste the code/script used to generate the table (R/Stata/SPSS/Python), and I’ll point out exactly where the missing categories are being dropped and where the New Age/Space vs Opera variables are being merged.
