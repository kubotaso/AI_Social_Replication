Score: 74/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing “(M) No answer” counts (generated shows all zeros)
- **Generated:** “(M) No answer” is `0` for every genre.
- **True:** “(M) No answer” is **nonzero for every genre** (values range roughly 10–15).

**Fix:** Replace the entire “(M) No answer” row with the true counts:

- **Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber):**  
  - Latin/Salsa **12**, Jazz **15**, Blues/R&B **12**, Show Tunes **14**, Oldies **10**, Classical/Chamber **11**
- **Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk):**  
  - Reggae **11**, Swing/Big Band **12**, New Age/Space **14**, Opera **13**, Bluegrass **11**, Folk **12**
- **Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel):**  
  - Pop/Easy Listening **13**, Contemporary Rock **12**, Rap **11**, Heavy Metal **10**, Country/Western **10**, Gospel **12**

### B. Column/category name issue: “New Age/Space Opera”
- **Generated column name:** “New Age/Space Opera” (appears merged into one column title).
- **True table:** Has **two separate columns**: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**.

**Fix:** Split the generated “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**:
- **New Age/Space** (counts already present under the “New Age/Space Opera” heading appear to match New Age/Space)
- **Opera** (currently missing as its own column—add it with the true counts)

Concretely, add an **Opera** column with true values (Panel 2):
- Like very much **73**
- Like it **257**
- Mixed feelings **359**
- Dislike it **515**
- Dislike very much **306**
- Don’t know much about it **83**
- No answer **13**
- Mean **3.48**

And rename the existing merged header to **New Age/Space** (keeping its values).

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

All rows (1)–(5) (“Like very much” through “Dislike very much”) **match the true table** for every genre shown.

The mismatches are concentrated in the two “M” rows:

### A. “(M) Don’t know much about it” — mismatches
Below are **every genre where generated ≠ true** (genre: generated → true):

**Panel 1**
- **Latin/Salsa:** 233 → **221**
- **Jazz:** 53 → **38**
- **Blues/R&B:** 68 → **56**
- **Show Tunes:** 91 → **77**
- **Oldies:** 51 → **41**
- **Classical/Chamber:** 77 → **66**

**Panel 2**
- **Reggae:** 306 → **295**
- **Swing/Big Band:** 176 → **164**
- **New Age/Space:** 306 → **292**
- **Opera:** 96 shown in merged column, but Opera is separate in truth; **Opera should be 83**  
  (and the **New Age/Space** “don’t know” should be **292**, not 306)
- **Bluegrass:** 174 → **163**
- **Folk:** 90 → **78**

**Panel 3**
- **Pop/Easy Listening:** 85 → **72**
- **Contemporary Rock:** 62 → **50**
- **Rap:** 72 → **61**
- **Heavy Metal:** 80 → **70**
- **Country/Western:** 32 → **22**
- **Gospel:** 47 → **35**

**Fix:** Replace each “Don’t know much about it” cell with the true value above.

### B. “(M) No answer” — mismatches
As noted, generated has **all zeros**, true has nonzero values (listed in section 1A).

**Fix:** Replace the zeros with the true “No answer” counts.

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- **Generated means match the true means** for every genre **provided you interpret the merged header correctly**:
  - The mean under “New Age/Space Opera” is **3.48**, which corresponds to **Opera** in the true table—not New Age/Space (which is **3.68**).
  - But generated also shows **3.68** under that same merged column set—this indicates the data are present but the header is wrong/merged.

**Fix:** Once you split “New Age/Space Opera” into **New Age/Space (Mean 3.68)** and **Opera (Mean 3.48)** and align the counts accordingly, the mean row will be correctly labeled.

### Totals / N (not displayed)
- Neither table shows totals per genre explicitly, but your generated table is internally inconsistent with the true table because:
  - Your “Don’t know” counts are too high in many places, and
  - You set “No answer” to zero.
This will inflate the implied sample size for each genre relative to the true table.

**Fix:** After correcting the two M-rows, the implied N per genre will match the true distribution.

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column: Opera
- **Generated:** Opera is **not a standalone column**.
- **True:** Opera is a standalone column (Panel 2).

**Fix:** Add the **Opera** column (values listed above) and rename the merged header appropriately.

### Extra/incorrect column: “New Age/Space Opera”
- **Generated:** A single combined column header.
- **True:** Two separate columns.

**Fix:** Replace “New Age/Space Opera” with two headers: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.

---

## What to change (minimal checklist)
1. **Split** “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”, and place the correct counts/means under each.
2. **Replace** the entire “(M) Don’t know much about it” row with the true values (all mismatches listed above).
3. **Replace** the entire “(M) No answer” row of zeros with the true nonzero counts (listed above).

After these edits, the generated table will match the true table exactly.
