Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing rows in the Generated Results

### What the true table contains (8 rows per genre)
For each genre, Table 3 has **these 8 rows**:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

### What the generated table contains
Your generated output has **8 rows**, but rows 6 and 7 are:

- row 6: all zeros  
- row 7: all zeros  

So the generated table is **missing the two “M” categories** and incorrectly replaces them with zeros.

#### How to fix
- Add the two missing rows with the correct counts:
  - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - **(M) No answer**
- Remove the all-zero rows.

---

## 2) Frequency counts: every mismatch (all are in the missing “M” rows)

Rows (1)–(5) match the true table for **all 18 genres**.  
Means also match (see section 4).  
The only frequency mismatches are that the generated table shows **0** where the true table has nonzero counts for the two missingness categories.

### Correct values to insert (replace the all-zero rows)

#### (M) Don’t know much about it  — true counts
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### (M) No answer — true counts
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

#### How to fix
Populate row 6 with the “Don’t know much about it” counts and row 7 with the “No answer” counts (or insert them as new labeled rows and shift Mean down).

## 3) Column items/categories: mismatches or missing/extra columns

### Column names
All **18 genre columns** present in the generated results match the true table’s genres:

Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

### What’s missing
What’s missing is **not columns**, but **row labels**:
- The generated output does not label the response categories ((1)…(5), (M)… etc.). That makes interpretation ambiguous.

#### How to fix
Add an explicit first column for **Attitude** (row labels) with the 8 category names listed above.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.): check for mismatches

### Means
The generated mean row matches the true means (to rounding) for all genres:

- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ **3.14**
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ **2.61**
- Blues/R&B 2.5 = **2.50**
- Show Tunes 2.594059 ≈ **2.59**
- Oldies 2.246302 ≈ **2.25**
- Classical/Chamber 2.669719 ≈ **2.67**
- Reggae 3.154615 ≈ **3.15**
- Swing/Big Band 2.447552 ≈ **2.45**
- New Age/Space 3.679231 ≈ **3.68**
- Opera 3.47947 ≈ **3.48**
- Bluegrass 2.665503 ≈ **2.67**
- Folk 2.759235 ≈ **2.76**
- Pop/Easy Listening 2.406969 ≈ **2.41**
- Contemporary Rock 2.670984 ≈ **2.67**
- Rap 3.921773 ≈ **3.92**
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ **4.12**
- Country/Western 2.324651 ≈ **2.32**
- Gospel 2.394484 ≈ **2.39**

No mean corrections needed.

### Totals / N (implied)
The true table implies totals per genre that include the two M categories. Your generated table’s implied totals are too small because the two M rows are zero.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total (since M rows are 0) = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- Missing = **233**, exactly 221 (“don’t know”) + 12 (“no answer”).

#### How to fix
Once you insert the correct M counts, totals per column will align with the true table.

---

## 5) Percentages
The true Table 3 shown provides **counts and means**, not percentages. Your generated output also provides counts and means (no percentages). So:
- There are **no percentage mismatches**, but
- If you later compute percentages from the generated table, they will be **wrong** until you fix the missing M rows (because the denominator N will be too small).

#### How to fix (if percentages are desired)
Compute percentages using **N = sum of all 7 count rows (including both M rows)** for each genre, and decide whether to:
- include missing categories in the denominator (as the table’s raw distribution does), or
- exclude them (valid responses only).  
But be consistent and label which you’re doing.

# Minimal correction needed to make Generated match True
1. Replace the two all-zero rows with:
   - Row: “(M) Don’t know much about it” (use the 18 counts listed)
   - Row: “(M) No answer” (use the 18 counts listed)
2. Add row labels (“Attitude”) so the categories are explicit.
3. Keep the mean row as-is (it already matches).
