Score: 67/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing rows + missing labels

### What the **true table** has (per genre)
It has **8 rows**:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

### What the **generated table** shows
- It includes the first **5 attitude rows** and the **Mean** row.
- It shows **two rows of all zeros** where the missing-data rows should be.

### Mismatch
- The generated table is **missing the two missing-data categories**:
  - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - **(M) No answer**
- Instead, it incorrectly reports them as **0 for every genre**.

### Fix
Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct counts from the true table for each genre (see Section 3 below). Also label rows explicitly to avoid ambiguity.

---

## 2) Column items/categories: naming/structure issues

### Columns (genres)
- The generated table includes **18 genres**, matching the true table’s 18.
- But it has a header issue: **“New Age/Space Opera”** is incorrect/merged.

### Mismatch
- True table has **two separate columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- Generated header combines them into **one label**: **“New Age/Space Opera”**, even though the data beneath clearly correspond to **two separate columns** (one for New Age/Space and one for Opera).

### Fix
Split/rename headers to match the true table:
- Rename **“New Age/Space Opera”** into **two columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
and ensure the values under each align correctly (they currently appear to do so).

---

## 3) Frequency counts: all mismatches (these are the errors)

### Good news: all non-missing attitude counts match
For rows (1)–(5) and the Mean row, the generated numbers match the true table **for every genre**.

### All mismatches are in the missing-data rows
The generated table reports **0** for both missing-data rows across all genres, but the true table has nonzero counts everywhere.

Below are the **true values that must replace the two zero rows**.

#### Panel 1: Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber
**(M) Don’t know much about it** (replace first zero row):
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer** (replace second zero row):
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2: Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk
**(M) Don’t know much about it**:
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer**:
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3: Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel
**(M) Don’t know much about it**:
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer**:
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

### Fix
Insert these values into the two missing-data rows in the generated table (and label them). Remove the zero rows.

---

## 4) Percentages: missing entirely (and therefore mismatched by omission)

### True table
- Provides **counts** (not percentages).

### Generated table
- Also provides **counts** (not percentages).

### Mismatch?
- If your generated output was *supposed* to include percentages, then they are **missing**. But compared strictly to the provided “True Results,” there is no percentage column to match.

### Fix (only if required by your analysis spec)
If you need percentages, compute them using the correct denominator (typically total responses including missing vs excluding missing—must match the table’s convention). But note: the true table as shown does **not** report percentages.

---

## 5) Summary statistics (means): check for mismatches

### Means
All **Mean** values in the generated table match the true table for all genres:
- Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Gospel 2.39, etc.

### Fix
No change needed for means—just ensure the missing-data rows are restored, because otherwise totals/denominators used elsewhere in an analysis could become inconsistent.

---

## 6) Totals/consistency implications (important)

By setting missing categories to zero, the generated table implicitly changes the **total N per genre** (it undercounts by “Don’t know” + “No answer”). That will break:
- any computed totals,
- any computed percentages,
- any comparisons to published Ns.

### Fix
After inserting the missing-data counts, recompute:
- per-genre totals (if you display them),
- any percentages,
- any weighted/unweighted Ns (if relevant).

# Minimal set of edits to make the generated table match the true table
1. **Replace the two all-zero rows** with:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it” counts (from true table)
   - “(M) No answer” counts (from true table)
2. **Fix the header**: split/rename **New Age/Space** and **Opera** (remove the merged “New Age/Space Opera” label).
3. Keep all other counts and the **Mean** row as-is (they already match).
