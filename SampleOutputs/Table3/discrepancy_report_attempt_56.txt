## 1) Wrong/missing **row categories** (Attitude items)

### Mismatch
Your **Generated Results** table includes only these 8 rows (implicitly):
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
6. (all zeros)  
7. (all zeros)  
8. Mean  

But the **True Results (Table 3)** require **8 specific rows**:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

In other words, rows 6 and 7 in the generated output are present but **incorrectly filled with 0s**, and also **not labeled** as the two “Missing” categories.

### How to fix
- Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct counts for:
  - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - **(M) No answer**
- Add proper row labels so they match the True table exactly.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches

### What matches
For **all 18 genres**, your generated counts for the first five attitude categories match the True table exactly:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much

Examples (they match):
- Latin/Salsa: 85, 325, 416, 403, 144 (all correct)
- Heavy Metal: 48, 123, 189, 400, 766 (all correct)
- Gospel: 356, 571, 364, 197, 71 (all correct)

### What does *not* match (major issue)
For **every genre**, the True table has nonzero values in the two missing-data rows, but the generated table shows **0** for all genres in both rows.

#### True values that are missing (need to be inserted)

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66  
- Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35  

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11  
- Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12  

### How to fix
- Populate the two missing-data rows with the above counts.
- Ensure your code is not dropping/recoding “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” into 0 or NA.
  - Common cause: treating missing codes as NA and then using a frequency function with `na.rm=TRUE` (or equivalent) that *drops* them rather than counting them as categories.
  - Solution: explicitly recode those responses into labeled factor levels before tabulating.

## 3) Percentages

### Mismatch
The **True table provides counts only** (no percentages shown).  
Your **Generated Results also provides counts only** (no percentages).

### How to fix
- No percentage mismatches to report because **percentages are not present in either table**.
- If you *intend* to compute percentages, you must:
  - Decide the denominator (usually total N including or excluding missing categories).
  - Make sure to include the two missing categories if you want to replicate Table 3’s full distribution.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (Mean)

### What matches
Your generated **Mean** row matches the True table (allowing for rounding) for all genres:

- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 → True 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 → True 2.61  
- Blues/R&B 2.5 → True 2.50  
- …  
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 → True 4.12  
- Gospel 2.394484 → True 2.39  

So the mean values are correct.

### Potential hidden issue to verify
Even though means match, ensure you’re computing them the same way as the source:
- The mean is almost certainly computed on the **1–5 scale excluding the two (M) categories** (or treating them as missing).
- Your means matching suggests you likely did exclude them correctly for the mean, but simultaneously failed to *count* them in the distribution table.

### How to fix (if needed)
- Keep the (M) categories excluded from mean calculation (as apparently done).
- But **include them as explicit categories** in the frequency table.

---

## 5) Column categories (genres) and missing/extra columns

### What matches
- All **18 genres** appear in the generated output, matching the True table:
  Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.
- No extra genres, none missing.

### Formatting difference (not a value mismatch)
- The True table is presented as three separate subtables of 6 genres each.
- Your generated output prints all 18 genres in one wide table. This is a presentation difference only.

---

## The complete set of discrepancies

1) **Rows 6 and 7 are wrong**: generated has two all-zero rows; True requires:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it (nonzero counts)
   - (M) No answer (nonzero counts)

2) **Missing labels for the attitude rows** (especially the missing-data categories).

No other count/mean/genre-name mismatches were found.

---

## What to change in the generated analysis output (so it matches Table 3)

- Output must have exactly these 8 labeled rows:
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
  7. (M) No answer  
  8. Mean  

- Fill rows 6–7 with the True counts (listed above), instead of zeros.
- Ensure your tabulation step treats “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” as **valid factor levels**, not as missing values that get dropped or zeroed out.
