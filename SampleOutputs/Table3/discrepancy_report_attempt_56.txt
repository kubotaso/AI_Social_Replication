Score: 70/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches and fixes

### A. Missing rows in the Generated Results
Your generated table includes these rows:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much
- (M) Don’t know much about it **(all zeros)**
- (M) No answer **(all zeros)**
- Mean

In the **true** table, the last two “M” rows are **not zero**; they contain substantial counts for every genre.

**Fix:** Populate the two “M” rows with the correct frequencies (see Section 2). Do **not** leave them as all zeros.

---

### B. Column/category naming error: “New Age/Space Opera”
The generated column header is **“New Age/Space Opera”**, which incorrectly merges two separate genres from the true table:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

In the true table (Panel 2), these are **two distinct columns**.

**Fix:** Split the generated “New Age/Space Opera” into two columns:
- New Age/Space
- Opera  
Then assign each its own frequencies/means (provided in the true table).

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre/row)

### Good news: the 1–5 attitude rows match
For all genres, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly** (including the New Age vs Opera values—your generated table contains both sets of numbers, but the header is wrong).

### The only frequency-count errors are the two “M” rows
In the generated table, both of these rows are **0 for every genre**, but in the true table they are **nonzero**.

#### Correct values that must replace the zeros

**(M) Don’t know much about it** (replace the all-zero row with these):
- Latin/Salsa: **221**
- Jazz: **38**
- Blues/R&B: **56**
- Show Tunes: **77**
- Oldies: **41**
- Classical/Chamber: **66**
- Reggae: **295**
- Swing/Big Band: **164**
- New Age/Space: **292**
- Opera: **83**
- Bluegrass: **163**
- Folk: **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72**
- Contemporary Rock: **50**
- Rap: **61**
- Heavy Metal: **70**
- Country/Western: **22**
- Gospel: **35**

**(M) No answer** (replace the all-zero row with these):
- Latin/Salsa: **12**
- Jazz: **15**
- Blues/R&B: **12**
- Show Tunes: **14**
- Oldies: **10**
- Classical/Chamber: **11**
- Reggae: **11**
- Swing/Big Band: **12**
- New Age/Space: **14**
- Opera: **13**
- Bluegrass: **11**
- Folk: **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13**
- Contemporary Rock: **12**
- Rap: **11**
- Heavy Metal: **10**
- Country/Western: **10**
- Gospel: **12**

**Fix:** Replace the generated zeros with the above true counts.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
All reported **means** in the generated table match the true table **numerically** for each genre.

However, there is a **labeling/structure problem**:
- Because “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are distinct in the true table, you should have **two mean entries** (3.68 for New Age/Space; 3.48 for Opera) under two separate columns.
- Your generated table *does show both numbers*, but they are placed under a **combined/incorrect header**.

**Fix:** After splitting the column, ensure:
- Mean(New Age/Space) = **3.68**
- Mean(Opera) = **3.48**

### Totals / sample size consistency (implied issue)
Even though you didn’t print totals, leaving the M-rows as zeros makes the implied column totals far too small and inconsistent with the true distribution. For example:

- Latin/Salsa true total = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
- Generated Latin/Salsa total (with zeros) = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373** (incorrect)

**Fix:** Once you add the correct M rows, totals will align.

---

## 4) Missing/extra column categories

### Missing column separation (critical)
- True table has **18 genres**, including **New Age/Space** and **Opera** separately.
- Generated table visually has 18 numeric series, but one header merges two genres, creating a **category definition error**.

**Fix:** Replace the single header “New Age/Space Opera” with two headers:
- “New Age/Space”
- “Opera”

No other genres are missing or extra.

---

## What to change so the generated matches the true table (checklist)

1. **Split the merged genre header**
   - Change “New Age/Space Opera” → two columns: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.

2. **Fill in the two missing-data rows**
   - Replace all zeros in:
     - (M) Don’t know much about it
     - (M) No answer  
   with the true counts listed above.

3. **(Optional but recommended) Add column totals**
   - This will help validate that each genre sums to the correct N (e.g., 1606 for Latin/Salsa) and prevent “all-zero M rows” mistakes from slipping through again.

If you want, I can rewrite your “Generated Results” table fully corrected (same layout, but with the proper two columns and the proper M-row counts).
