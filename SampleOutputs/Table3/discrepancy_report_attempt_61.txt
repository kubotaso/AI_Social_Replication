## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing row: **(M) No answer**
- **Generated:** shows “(M) No answer” but sets **0 for every genre**.
- **True:** “(M) No answer” is **nonzero for every genre** (values range ~10–15 depending on genre).

**Fix:** Populate the “(M) No answer” row with the true counts (listed in section 2 below). Do not leave them as zeros.

### B. Wrong row label/column structure: **“New Age/Space Opera”**
- **Generated column header:** `New Age/Space Opera` (a single genre).
- **True table:** separates as **New Age/Space** and **Opera** (two distinct genres/columns).

**Fix:** Split the generated combined column into **two columns**:
- `New Age/Space`
- `Opera`
…and use the correct counts for each.

### C. Missing column category: **Opera**
- **Generated:** Opera is not present as its own column (it’s incorrectly merged into “New Age/Space Opera”).
- **True:** Opera is a separate column in Panel 2.

**Fix:** Add an **Opera** column and move the Opera frequencies there.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/genre)

Most “(1)–(5)” rows match the true table. The mismatches are concentrated in the **(M) Don’t know much about it** row and the **(M) No answer** row, plus the merged **New Age/Space vs Opera** issue.

### A. Row **(M) Don’t know much about it**: mismatched counts

#### Panel 1 genres
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix (set to true) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Latin/Salsa | 233 | 221 | 221 |
| Jazz | 53 | 38 | 38 |
| Blues/R&B | 68 | 56 | 56 |
| Show Tunes | 91 | 77 | 77 |
| Oldies | 51 | 41 | 41 |
| Classical/Chamber | 77 | 66 | 66 |

#### Panel 2 genres
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Reggae | 306 | 295 | 295 |
| Swing/Big Band | 176 | 164 | 164 |
| **New Age/Space** | 306 | 292 | 292 |
| **Opera** | 96 | 83 | 83 |
| Bluegrass | 174 | 163 | 163 |
| Folk | 90 | 78 | 78 |

**Important:** Your generated table can’t be correct here until you **split “New Age/Space Opera” into two columns**; right now you’re effectively reporting one column’s DK values as if it represented both.

#### Panel 3 genres
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Pop/Easy Listening | 85 | 72 | 72 |
| Contemporary Rock | 62 | 50 | 50 |
| Rap | 72 | 61 | 61 |
| Heavy Metal | 80 | 70 | 70 |
| Country/Western | 32 | 22 | 22 |
| Gospel | 47 | 35 | 35 |

### B. Row **(M) No answer**: generated zeros vs true nonzero

Set the “(M) No answer” row to:

#### Panel 1
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (Means, totals, etc.)

### A. Means
- **Generated means match the True means** for all genres shown.
- However, because your generated **missing-data rows are wrong** (DK and No answer), the means *would not be internally consistent* if someone tried to recompute them from your displayed frequencies.

**Fix:** Correct the DK and No answer counts as above so the displayed mean can be legitimately derived from the table.

### B. Totals / N consistency (implied issue)
The true table implies a consistent sample size per genre (sum of all response categories including DK + No answer). Your generated table changes those totals because:
- DK counts are inflated/shifted
- No answer counts are incorrectly set to 0

**Fix:** After correcting DK and No answer rows, each genre’s column total will align with the true table.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

- **Extra/incorrect:** `New Age/Space Opera` (should not exist as one column)
- **Missing:** `Opera` (separate column)

**Fix:** Rename and restructure columns to match the true table exactly:
- Keep `New Age/Space`
- Add `Opera`
- Remove the merged label `New Age/Space Opera`

---

## 5) What to change in the generated analysis to match the true table (checklist)

1. **Split the merged genre column**: replace `New Age/Space Opera` with **two** columns: `New Age/Space` and `Opera`.
2. **Replace the entire “(M) Don’t know much about it” row** with the true counts (all mismatches listed above).
3. **Replace the “(M) No answer” row** zeros with the true nonzero counts (listed above).
4. Re-verify that **column totals** match the true table (they will once steps 2–3 are fixed).
5. Keep the **(1)–(5)** rows and **Mean** row as they are (they already match), but confirm means remain consistent after fixing missing categories.

If you want, I can rewrite your full generated table into the corrected format (18 columns with separate New Age/Space and Opera) using the true values.
