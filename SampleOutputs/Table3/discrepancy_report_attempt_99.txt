Score: 63/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatched (names/number of items)

### A. Missing response categories in the generated table
The **true Table 3** has **8 rows** per genre:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

The **generated results show 8 rows**, but rows 6–7 are wrong:

- Row 6 in generated output contains **nonzero counts**, but it is unlabeled; it appears intended to be **“Don’t know much about it”**.
- Row 7 in generated output is **all zeros**, but in the true table row 7 is **“No answer”** and is **not zero**.

**Fix:** Add explicit row labels and populate both missingness rows correctly:
- Row 6 = “(M) Don’t know much about it” (use true counts)
- Row 7 = “(M) No answer” (use true counts, not zeros)

### B. Extra/irrelevant “True Results” tables vs what was generated
The “True Results” section includes Tables **1 and 2 (regressions)** in addition to **Table 3 (frequency distributions)**. The generated output corresponds only to Table 3.

**Fix:** If the task is “compare generated vs true frequency table,” restrict the “true” comparison target to **Table 3 only** (or generate Tables 1–2 too, if they were expected).

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

For the first 5 attitude rows and the Mean row, the generated counts match the true table. The mismatches are entirely in the **missingness categories**:

### A. “Don’t know much about it” row (true) vs generated row 6
Generated row 6 values are **wrong for every genre** (they do not match the true “Don’t know” counts).

Below are the **true “Don’t know much about it” counts** (what row 6 *should* be), compared to the **generated row 6** (currently shown):

**Latin/Salsa:** true 221 vs generated 233  
**Jazz:** 38 vs 53  
**Blues/R&B:** 56 vs 68  
**Show Tunes:** 77 vs 91  
**Oldies:** 41 vs 51  
**Classical/Chamber:** 66 vs 77  

**Reggae:** 295 vs 306  
**Swing/Big Band:** 164 vs 176  
**New Age/Space:** 292 vs 306  
**Opera:** 83 vs 96  
**Bluegrass:** 163 vs 174  
**Folk:** 78 vs 90  

**Pop/Easy Listening:** 72 vs 85  
**Contemporary Rock:** 50 vs 62  
**Rap:** 61 vs 72  
**Heavy Metal:** 70 vs 80  
**Country/Western:** 22 vs 32  
**Gospel:** 35 vs 47  

**Fix:** Replace the generated row 6 entirely with the true “Don’t know much about it” counts above.

### B. “No answer” row (true) is missing; generated row 7 is incorrectly all zeros
True “No answer” counts (row 7) are **nonzero** for every genre, but generated output shows all zeros.

True “No answer” counts are:

- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11  
- Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12  

**Fix:** Populate row 7 with these values (and label it “(M) No answer”).

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The generated “Mean” row matches the true mean values (allowing for rounding/precision). Examples:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 vs true 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 vs true 2.61  
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 vs true 4.12  

**No fixes needed for means**, aside from optionally rounding to 2 decimals to match the true table presentation.

### Implied totals / consistency check (important)
Because the generated table has:
- an incorrect “Don’t know” row, and
- a zero “No answer” row,

the **total N per genre implied by the generated counts is wrong** (even if the first five rows match).

**Fix:** After correcting rows 6–7, recompute any totals/percentages (if you report them) using:
\[
N = \text{Like very much} + \text{Like it} + \text{Mixed} + \text{Dislike} + \text{Dislike very much} + \text{Don’t know} + \text{No answer}
\]

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns
The generated output includes all **18 genres** present in the true table:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

**No missing/extra genre columns.**

### But: Missing explicit “Attitude” column/labels
True table has an “Attitude” label column listing the categories. Generated output lacks those labels and is just numeric rows.

**Fix:** Add an “Attitude” row-name/index column so the 8 rows are explicitly:
1–5, Don’t know, No answer, Mean.

---

## What to change so the generated matches the true table (minimal patch list)

1. **Rename/label rows** to match the 8 true categories.  
2. **Replace row 6** with the true “Don’t know much about it” counts.  
3. **Replace row 7** (all zeros) with the true “No answer” counts.  
4. Optionally **round means** to 2 decimals to match formatting in the true table.  

After those corrections, the generated frequency table will align with the true Table 3.
