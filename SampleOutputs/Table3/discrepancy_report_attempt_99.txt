Score: 70/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

**Mismatch: “Don’t know much about it” row is wrong (all zeros) in Generated Results.**  
- **True table includes nonzero counts for “(M) Don’t know much about it” for every genre.**
- Generated table incorrectly shows `0` for every genre.

**Fix:** Replace the generated “(M) Don’t know much about it” row with the true counts (listed in section 2).

---

**Mismatch: “No answer” row exists but has the wrong values in Generated Results.**  
- The Generated “(M) No answer” counts are **large** (e.g., Latin/Salsa = 233), but in the True table they are **small** (mostly 10–15).

**Fix:** Replace the generated “(M) No answer” row with the true counts (listed in section 2).

---

**Potential label/structure issue: “New Age/Space Opera” is merged into one header in Generated Results.**  
- True table splits this into two separate columns: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera.”**
- Generated header appears to mash them together as one phrase (“New Age/Space Opera”) while still showing two numeric columns (48 and 73 in the “Like very much” row), suggesting a formatting/column-name error.

**Fix:** Rename/split the headers to match the True table exactly:
- Column should be **New Age/Space**
- Next column should be **Opera**
Do not combine them into one genre name.

---

### 2) Frequency-count mismatches (by category/genre)

For the five substantive response categories **(1)–(5)**, the Generated counts **match** the True table across all genres.

All mismatches are concentrated in the two missing-data rows:

#### A) “(M) Don’t know much about it” — Generated shows all 0; True has:

**Panel 1 genres**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 genres**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 genres**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix:** Populate these values in the generated table (instead of zeros).

---

#### B) “(M) No answer” — Generated values are wrong; True values are:

**Panel 1 genres**
- Latin/Salsa **12** (Generated: 233)
- Jazz **15** (Generated: 53)
- Blues/R&B **12** (Generated: 68)
- Show Tunes **14** (Generated: 91)
- Oldies **10** (Generated: 51)
- Classical/Chamber **11** (Generated: 77)

**Panel 2 genres**
- Reggae **11** (Generated: 306)
- Swing/Big Band **12** (Generated: 176)
- New Age/Space **14** (Generated: 306)
- Opera **13** (Generated: 96)
- Bluegrass **11** (Generated: 174)
- Folk **12** (Generated: 90)

**Panel 3 genres**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13** (Generated: 85)
- Contemporary Rock **12** (Generated: 62)
- Rap **11** (Generated: 72)
- Heavy Metal **10** (Generated: 80)
- Country/Western **10** (Generated: 32)
- Gospel **12** (Generated: 47)

**Fix:** Replace the entire “(M) No answer” row with these true values.

---

### 3) Percentages

- The Generated Results table shows **counts only** (no percentages).
- The True Results table also shows **counts only** (no percentages).

**Mismatch:** None here (percentages simply aren’t present in either).  
**If you intended percentages:** you’d need to compute them using the correct denominators (typically total N per genre, including or excluding missing depending on convention). But that’s not a discrepancy between these two tables as shown.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (Mean)

**Means match** between Generated and True for every genre (e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Gospel 2.39).

**However:** If your generated means were computed using the generated missing rows (zeros for DK and huge No Answer), the means would likely be wrong. The fact they match suggests the mean calculation was done correctly from the substantive categories (or from correct underlying data) but the missing rows were reported incorrectly.

**Fix:** Ensure the reporting step for missing categories uses the correct counts (above). The mean row can remain as-is since it already matches the true table.

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories

**Column set (18 genres) is present in both**, but with one important naming/formatting discrepancy:

- True has separate columns: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**
- Generated displays a combined header text: **“New Age/Space Opera”** (ambiguous/incorrect)

**Fix:** Split/rename those headers to exactly match the True table. Verify each numeric column aligns under the correct header:
- New Age/Space column: counts starting with 48, 186, 269, 429, 368, 292, 14; mean 3.68
- Opera column: counts starting with 73, 257, 359, 515, 306, 83, 13; mean 3.48

---

## Bottom line: what to change to make Generated match True
1. **Replace the entire “(M) Don’t know much about it” row** (currently all zeros) with the true per-genre counts listed above.
2. **Replace the entire “(M) No answer” row** with the true small counts listed above.
3. **Fix the column naming/structure for New Age/Space vs Opera** so they are two distinct genre columns with correct labels and alignment.

Everything else (the 1–5 category frequencies and the means) already matches the True table.
