Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### A. Missing response rows in the Generated Results
The Generated table includes these rows:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much
- (M) Don’t know much about it
- (M) No answer
- Mean

But the **values for the two “M” rows are all zeros**, which effectively means the generated table is **missing the actual “Don’t know” and “No answer” frequency distributions** that exist in the True table for every genre.

**Fix:** Populate the two “M” rows with the correct counts from the True table (see Section 2).

### B. Column/category naming discrepancy: “New Age/Space Opera”
In the Generated column headers, one genre is labeled **“New Age/Space Opera”**.
In the True table, Panel 2 has **two separate columns**:  
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

So the Generated output has **incorrect column structure and labeling**, combining two genres into one header string.

**Fix:** Split “New Age/Space Opera” into **two separate columns**:
- New Age/Space
- Opera  
and ensure each has its own frequency distribution and mean (they already appear as separate *numbers* in the Generated table; only the header is wrong/merged).

### C. Number of genre columns
The True table has **18 genres** total. The Generated table *appears* to contain the same 18 sets of numbers, but because of the merged/mislabeled header (“New Age/Space Opera”), the **genre labeling does not correctly represent the 18 distinct genres**.

**Fix:** Correct the header so there are explicitly 18 distinct genre columns matching the True table.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (including missing rows)

### Key point:
For response categories (1)–(5), the Generated counts **match the True counts** across all genres.

All mismatches are in the two missing-data rows:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**: Generated shows **0 for every genre**, but True has nonzero counts.
- **(M) No answer**: Generated shows **0 for every genre**, but True has nonzero counts.

Below are the correct values that must replace the zeros.

### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix (overall):** Replace the two all-zero missing-data rows with the correct counts above.

---

## 3) Percentages
Neither table shows percentages—both are counts (plus means). So:
- There are **no percentage mismatches to enumerate**.
- If the Generated analysis intended to include percentages, it is **missing an entire percentage section**.

**Fix (if percentages are required):**
1. Compute column totals for each genre: sum of (1)–(5) + DK + NA.
2. Divide each row count by that genre total and multiply by 100.
3. Add percentage rows/columns clearly labeled.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The **Mean row matches perfectly** between Generated and True for every genre (including the New Age/Space and Opera means: 3.68 and 3.48 respectively are present—just mislabeled in the header).

So there are **no mean-value discrepancies**.

### Missing totals / N
The True table (as shown) does not include explicit totals (N) per genre either, so there’s no direct mismatch. However, because the Generated table set DK/NA to 0, any computed totals from the Generated output would be **incorrect**.

**Fix (if totals are used elsewhere in the generated analysis):**
- Recompute totals per genre after inserting DK and NA counts.  
Example: Latin/Salsa total should be  
85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606** (not 1373).

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing distinct column separation: New Age/Space vs Opera
As noted, the Generated header **fails to represent** that New Age/Space and Opera are **separate columns** in the True table.

**Fix:** Ensure two distinct columns:
- New Age/Space
- Opera

No other extra/missing genre columns are evident beyond that labeling/structural issue.

# What to change so the Generated matches the True table (checklist)

1. **Replace the all-zero values** in:
   - (M) Don’t know much about it
   - (M) No answer  
   with the correct counts for each genre (listed above).

2. **Correct the genre headers** by splitting “New Age/Space Opera” into:
   - New Age/Space
   - Opera

3. If the generated analysis computed any **N’s, proportions, or downstream summaries**, **recompute them** after fixing DK/NA because the zeros would have biased totals and any derived percentages.

If you want, I can also compute and provide the **correct per-genre totals (N)** for all 18 genres so you can validate any downstream calculations.
