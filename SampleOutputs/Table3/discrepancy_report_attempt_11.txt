Score: 82/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names and number of items)

**A. Missing/incorrect row labels in the generated table**
- **Generated table has no “Attitude” row labels** (e.g., “(1) Like very much”, …, “Mean”). It shows only numbers.
  - **Fix:** Add the Attitude labels exactly as in the true table:
    1. (1) Like very much  
    2. (2) Like it  
    3. (3) Mixed feelings  
    4. (4) Dislike it  
    5. (5) Dislike very much  
    6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
    7. (M) No answer  
    8. Mean

**B. Wrong counts in two “missing-data” rows**
- The generated table *does* include two extra rows before the Mean (so the **number of rows matches** the true structure: 5 substantive + 2 missing + mean), but the **values in those two missing rows are wrong in multiple columns** (details below).
  - **Fix:** Replace the “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” rows with the true counts.

**C. Column/category structure**
- The generated output lists all 18 genres in one wide header line; the true table splits them into three panels.  
- **This is not a mismatch** in categories—**all 18 genres are present**—but the generated format makes it hard to verify.
  - **Fix (formatting):** Present the results in the same panel structure (Panel 1/2/3) or clearly separate genre blocks.

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

All “Like very much” through “Dislike very much” rows **match perfectly** across all 18 genres.

The mismatches occur in the two missing-data rows:

#### A. Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)

**Row: (M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa: **Generated 210** vs **True 221** → wrong  
- Jazz: **Generated 48** vs **True 38** → wrong  
- Blues/R&B: **Generated 61** vs **True 56** → wrong  
- Show Tunes: **Generated 82** vs **True 77** → wrong  
- Oldies: **Generated 46** vs **True 41** → wrong  
- Classical/Chamber: **Generated 69** vs **True 66** → wrong  

**Row: (M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa: **Generated 23** vs **True 12** → wrong  
- Jazz: **Generated 5** vs **True 15** → wrong  
- Blues/R&B: **Generated 7** vs **True 12** → wrong  
- Show Tunes: **Generated 9** vs **True 14** → wrong  
- Oldies: **Generated 5** vs **True 10** → wrong  
- Classical/Chamber: **Generated 8** vs **True 11** → wrong  

#### B. Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)

**Row: (M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae: **Generated 275** vs **True 295** → wrong  
- Swing/Big Band: **Generated 158** vs **True 164** → wrong  
- New Age/Space: **Generated 275** vs **True 292** → wrong  
- Opera: **Generated 86** vs **True 83** → wrong  
- Bluegrass: **Generated 157** vs **True 163** → wrong  
- Folk: **Generated 81** vs **True 78** → wrong  

**Row: (M) No answer**
- Reggae: **Generated 31** vs **True 11** → wrong  
- Swing/Big Band: **Generated 18** vs **True 12** → wrong  
- New Age/Space: **Generated 31** vs **True 14** → wrong  
- Opera: **Generated 10** vs **True 13** → wrong  
- Bluegrass: **Generated 17** vs **True 11** → wrong  
- Folk: **Generated 9** vs **True 12** → wrong  

#### C. Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)

**Row: (M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **Generated 76** vs **True 72** → wrong  
- Contemporary Rock: **Generated 56** vs **True 50** → wrong  
- Rap: **Generated 65** vs **True 61** → wrong  
- Heavy Metal: **Generated 72** vs **True 70** → wrong  
- Country/Western: **Generated 29** vs **True 22** → wrong  
- Gospel: **Generated 42** vs **True 35** → wrong  

**Row: (M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **Generated 9** vs **True 13** → wrong  
- Contemporary Rock: **Generated 6** vs **True 12** → wrong  
- Rap: **Generated 7** vs **True 11** → wrong  
- Heavy Metal: **Generated 8** vs **True 10** → wrong  
- Country/Western: **Generated 3** vs **True 10** → wrong  
- Gospel: **Generated 5** vs **True 12** → wrong  

**Key pattern:** the generated “No answer” counts are often much larger or smaller than true, and “Don’t know much” is consistently off. This suggests the generated analysis likely:
- mis-classified missing codes, or
- swapped some missing categories, or
- used a different rule for what counts as “don’t know” vs “no answer”.

### 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** All reported means in the generated table **match exactly** with the true table (all 18 genres).

**Totals:** The generated table does not show totals or percentages. The true table also does not show totals/percentages.  
- **However, internally the totals implied by the generated counts will differ from the true totals** because the last two rows differ. If you computed N per genre, it would not match the true table’s implied N.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

- **No genres are missing** and **no extra genres appear**.
- The only “category” issue is the absence of the **Attitude** label column in the generated output (a presentation mismatch, not a data-category mismatch).
  - **Fix:** Add the first column “Attitude” with the seven response categories plus Mean, as in the true table.

---

### 5) How to fix the generated analysis so it matches the true table

1) **Correct the coding/handling of missing responses**
   - Ensure the source data codes for:
     - “Don’t know much about it”
     - “No answer”
   are mapped exactly to those two rows and **not merged, swapped, or partially dropped**.
   - The generated table’s first five categories match perfectly, so the error is isolated to **missing-data categorization**.

2) **Do not reallocate missing values**
   - Some pipelines “redistribute” missing/unknown responses or treat “don’t know” as neutral. Don’t do that here—these are **separate frequency rows**.

3) **Regenerate the frequency table using the same denominator/filters**
   - Apply the same sample restrictions used in the true table (GSS 1993; same respondent universe). If you filtered differently, missing rows can shift even if the substantive categories coincidentally match.

4) **Output in the same structure**
   - Add the Attitude row labels and (optionally) split into three panels. This doesn’t change numbers but prevents alignment/interpretation errors.

If you tell me what software/code produced the generated table (R `table()`, `dplyr`, Stata `tab`, etc.) and what the original response codes are, I can specify the exact recode statement that will force “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” to match the true counts.
