============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing attitude rows in the Generated Results
The generated table includes these rows:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- (M) Don’t know much about it  
- (M) No answer  
- Mean  

But for the last two “M” rows, **all entries are incorrectly shown as 0**. In the true table, **both of these rows have nonzero counts for every genre**.

**Fix:** Replace the all-zero “(M) Don’t know much about it” and “(M) No answer” rows with the true counts (see Section 2).

### B. Column/category naming mismatch
In the generated header you have: **“New Age/Space Opera”** (as one combined label).

In the true table, **New Age/Space** and **Opera** are two *separate* genre columns:
- New Age/Space
- Opera

In the generated table, these appear to be **merged into one incorrectly named column** and you therefore have the wrong number/structure of genre columns.

**Fix:** Split “New Age/Space Opera” into two columns:
- “New Age/Space”
- “Opera”
and allocate the correct counts to each (see below).

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre and response category)

### Panel 1 genres (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
For the first five response categories (1)–(5), your generated counts **match** the true table.

But the **two “M” rows are wrong (0 instead of true counts)**:

**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Latin/Salsa: **221** (not 0)
- Jazz: **38**
- Blues/R&B: **56**
- Show Tunes: **77**
- Oldies: **41**
- Classical/Chamber: **66**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Latin/Salsa: **12**
- Jazz: **15**
- Blues/R&B: **12**
- Show Tunes: **14**
- Oldies: **10**
- Classical/Chamber: **11**

### Panel 2 genres (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
For the first five response categories (1)–(5), the generated counts shown for:
- Reggae, Swing/Big Band, Bluegrass, Folk  
match the true table.

But again, the **two “M” rows are wrong (0)** and must be replaced:

**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Reggae: **295**
- Swing/Big Band: **164**
- New Age/Space: **292**
- Opera: **83**
- Bluegrass: **163**
- Folk: **78**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Reggae: **11**
- Swing/Big Band: **12**
- New Age/Space: **14**
- Opera: **13**
- Bluegrass: **11**
- Folk: **12**

#### Additional structural mismatch here (New Age/Space vs Opera)
Because your generated output **merged New Age/Space and Opera**, the counts you show under “New Age/Space Opera” (for categories 1–5 and the mean) are not aligned to the true table’s two separate columns. Even though the *numbers you show* (48,186,269,429,368; mean 3.68) correspond to **New Age/Space** in the true table, you are **missing the Opera column entirely**.

**Fix:** Keep those numbers under **New Age/Space**, and add a new **Opera** column with the true Opera counts:
- Like very much: **73**
- Like it: **257**
- Mixed feelings: **359**
- Dislike it: **515**
- Dislike very much: **306**
- Don’t know much: **83**
- No answer: **13**
- Mean: **3.48**

### Panel 3 genres (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
For the first five response categories (1)–(5), your generated counts **match** the true table.

But again, the **two “M” rows are wrong (0)** and should be:

**(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72**
- Contemporary Rock: **50**
- Rap: **61**
- Heavy Metal: **70**
- Country/Western: **22**
- Gospel: **35**

**(M) No answer** should be:
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13**
- Contemporary Rock: **12**
- Rap: **11**
- Heavy Metal: **10**
- Country/Western: **10**
- Gospel: **12**

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
All means displayed in the generated output **match the true means** *for the columns that exist and are correctly defined*.

However, because you **omitted Opera as its own genre column**, you are missing the **Opera mean = 3.48** as a separate statistic. (You currently show 3.48 nowhere as an Opera column mean; you only have it implicitly buried in the merged header label problem.)

**Fix:** Add the Opera column (as above) and include its mean **3.48**.

### Totals / N checks (implicit issue)
Even though totals are not explicitly shown, setting the M rows to zero changes the implied sample size per genre. In the true table, each genre’s total N is:
- Sum of (1)–(5) + Don’t know + No answer

Your generated table incorrectly implies **smaller N** because it drops the “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts.

**Fix:** Use the true “M” counts so the per-genre totals align with the GSS table.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column: Opera
As noted, **Opera is missing as a separate column** due to the merged label “New Age/Space Opera.”

**Fix:** Add Opera as its own column with the correct distribution and mean, and rename the other to “New Age/Space”.

### Extra/incorrect column label: “New Age/Space Opera”
This is not a valid single genre category in the true table.

**Fix:** Replace with two columns: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.

---

## What to change so Generated matches True (checklist)

1. **Replace all-zero “(M) Don’t know much about it” row** with the true counts for each genre.
2. **Replace all-zero “(M) No answer” row** with the true counts for each genre.
3. **Split the merged genre column**:
   - Rename “New Age/Space Opera” → “New Age/Space”
   - Add a new “Opera” column with the true Opera counts and mean.
4. Reconfirm column order/headers match the true table’s 18 genres exactly:
   - Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber,
   - Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk,
   - Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel

That set of fixes resolves **all** discrepancies between the generated output and the true table.
