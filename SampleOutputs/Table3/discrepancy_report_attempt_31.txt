Score: 70/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories (names + number of rows)

### Mismatch: Missing “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts
- **Generated table** includes rows:
  - (M) Don’t know much about it = **0 for every genre**
  - (M) No answer = **0 for every genre**
- **True table** shows **nonzero** values for both rows for **every genre**.

**How to fix**
- Do not treat these as “0”; they are valid categories with real frequencies.
- In your code, ensure the source variable(s) still contain distinct codes for:
  - “Don’t know much about it”
  - “No answer”
- When tabulating, include missing categories rather than dropping them or coercing them to NA and then excluding them from counts.

### Mismatch: Column header structure (genre names)
- **Generated header** merges/scrambles two columns: **“New Age/Space Opera”** (looks like one combined column).
- **True table** has **two separate columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**

**How to fix**
- Split that combined column into **two separate genre variables** (“New Age/Space” and “Opera”) and tabulate them independently.
- Verify you didn’t accidentally concatenate column names or join two variables during import/reshape.

## 2) Frequency counts (by response category)

### For the 5 substantive attitude categories (1)–(5): **they match**
For all genres shown, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  

…match the **true** table values (I spot-checked across all panels; no discrepancies appear in these five rows).

### For the “M” categories: **all generated values are wrong (set to 0)**
Below are the **true nonzero counts** that are missing in the generated output.

#### Panel 1: Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber
- **(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:  
  - Latin/Salsa **221**, Jazz **38**, Blues/R&B **56**, Show Tunes **77**, Oldies **41**, Classical/Chamber **66**
- **(M) No answer** should be:  
  - Latin/Salsa **12**, Jazz **15**, Blues/R&B **12**, Show Tunes **14**, Oldies **10**, Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2: Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk
- **(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:  
  - Reggae **295**, Swing/Big Band **164**, New Age/Space **292**, Opera **83**, Bluegrass **163**, Folk **78**
- **(M) No answer** should be:  
  - Reggae **11**, Swing/Big Band **12**, New Age/Space **14**, Opera **13**, Bluegrass **11**, Folk **12**

#### Panel 3: Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel
- **(M) Don’t know much about it** should be:  
  - Pop/Easy Listening **72**, Contemporary Rock **50**, Rap **61**, Heavy Metal **70**, Country/Western **22**, Gospel **35**
- **(M) No answer** should be:  
  - Pop/Easy Listening **13**, Contemporary Rock **12**, Rap **11**, Heavy Metal **10**, Country/Western **10**, Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- When you compute the frequency table, explicitly include these categories.
- Common failure modes:
  1. **Recoding DK/NA to system missing** and then using a function that drops missing by default.
  2. Using only levels 1–5 in factor/labels, thereby **discarding** M categories.
  3. Filtering them out prior to tabulation.

## 3) Percentages
- **Generated output shows no percentages**.
- The prompt asks to check “frequency counts or percentages”; since the generated table does not report percentages, it is **missing a percentage column/section** relative to that requirement (though the *true table* as provided also reports counts only).

**How to fix (if percentages are required)**
- Add a second line/column per cell (or separate table) with percentages.
- Be explicit about denominator:
  - Percent of **all cases including M categories**, or
  - Percent of **valid responses only (1–5)**  
  The choice will materially change percentages because M categories are sizable.

## 4) Summary statistics (means)

### Means: they match
The generated **Mean** row values match the true table for all genres:
- Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, Blues/R&B 2.50, Show Tunes 2.59, Oldies 2.25, Classical/Chamber 2.67
- Reggae 3.15, Swing/Big Band 2.45, New Age/Space 3.68, Opera 3.48, Bluegrass 2.67, Folk 2.76
- Pop/Easy Listening 2.41, Contemporary Rock 2.67, Rap 3.92, Heavy Metal 4.12, Country/Western 2.32, Gospel 2.39

### But: the means are inconsistent with your displayed “M=0” rows
If “Don’t know” and “No answer” were truly zero, the means would generally shift (and totals would differ). The fact that means match the true table strongly suggests:
- you **did** compute means correctly (likely excluding M categories), but
- you **printed M category frequencies incorrectly** (as zeros).

**How to fix**
- Align the frequency computation with the mean computation:
  - If means exclude M categories, that’s fine—but frequencies must still show M counts (as the true table does).
  - Alternatively, if you intended to exclude M categories from the displayed distribution, then **remove the M rows entirely** rather than listing them as zeros. But that would not match the true table.

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Extra/incorrect combined column label
- Generated: **“New Age/Space Opera”** (one column)
- True: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** (two columns)

**How to fix**
- Ensure you have **18 genre columns** and the correct names:
  1. Latin/Salsa
  2. Jazz
  3. Blues/R&B
  4. Show Tunes
  5. Oldies
  6. Classical/Chamber
  7. Reggae
  8. Swing/Big Band
  9. New Age/Space
  10. Opera
  11. Bluegrass
  12. Folk
  13. Pop/Easy Listening
  14. Contemporary Rock
  15. Rap
  16. Heavy Metal
  17. Country/Western
  18. Gospel

## Bottom line: what’s wrong and what to change
1. **Your (M) rows are entirely wrong** (all zeros). Replace them with the true nonzero counts by fixing your tabulation to include DK/NA categories.
2. **You combined “New Age/Space” and “Opera” into one column header**. Split into two columns/variables and tabulate separately.
3. **Means match**, but they currently conflict with the displayed “M” rows—so fix the frequency rows to be consistent with how means were computed and with the true table.
