Score: 62/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing and incorrect rows

### A. Missing response categories (rows)
Your **Generated Results** table includes these 8 rows (implicitly):
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
6. *(some “M” row, but values don’t match either M category)*  
7. a row of all zeros  
8. Mean  

The **True Table 3** has **9 rows** per genre:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

So the generated output is missing **both missing-data rows as distinct categories**, and instead has:
- **One incorrect “M” row** (your 6th row), and  
- **One spurious all-zero row** (your 7th row) that does not exist in the true table.

**How to fix**
- Add two explicit rows for missing data:  
  - “Don’t know much about it”  
  - “No answer”
- Remove the all-zero row entirely.
- Ensure the row labeled “Don’t know much about it” uses the correct counts, and “No answer” uses the correct counts.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre)

For rows (1)–(5) **and Mean**, your generated counts **match the true table** across all 18 genres.

All mismatches are in the missing-data rows.

### A. “Don’t know much about it” row: wrong for every genre
Your generated 6th row is **not equal** to the true “Don’t know much about it” counts. Example comparisons (Generated → True):

**Latin/Salsa:** 233 → **221**  
**Jazz:** 53 → **38**  
**Blues/R&B:** 68 → **56**  
**Show Tunes:** 91 → **77**  
**Oldies:** 51 → **41**  
**Classical/Chamber:** 77 → **66**  
**Reggae:** 306 → **295**  
**Swing/Big Band:** 176 → **164**  
**New Age/Space:** 306 → **292**  
**Opera:** 96 → **83**  
**Bluegrass:** 174 → **163**  
**Folk:** 90 → **78**  
**Pop/Easy Listening:** 85 → **72**  
**Contemporary Rock:** 62 → **50**  
**Rap:** 72 → **61**  
**Heavy Metal:** 80 → **70**  
**Country/Western:** 32 → **22**  
**Gospel:** 47 → **35**

**Pattern / diagnosis:**  
Your “Don’t know” row appears to be **too large** and looks like it may be **combining “Don’t know much about it” + “No answer” + possibly other missing codes**, or using an incorrect denominator/source.

**How to fix**
- Recompute “Don’t know much about it” counts using only the correct code/category (whatever the dataset uses for DK/Not familiar), excluding “No answer”.

---

### B. “No answer” row: completely missing and replaced by zeros
True table has nonzero “No answer” counts for every genre, but your generated output has a **row of all zeros** (row 7).

True “No answer” counts are (by genre):
- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical 11
- Reggae 11; Swing 12; New Age 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12
- Pop 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country 10; Gospel 12

**How to fix**
- Add the “No answer” row with these counts.
- Remove the all-zero row.
- Ensure your tabulation includes the NA/refusal category rather than dropping it or recoding it to 0.

---

## 3) Percentages: not shown (and therefore incomplete)
The user request asks to compare **counts or percentages**, but your generated output provides **counts only** (and a mean). The true table also provides counts only, so **there’s no percentage mismatch to check**, but your generated output still fails the “counts or percentages” requirement if the intention was to include percentages.

**How to fix**
- If percentages are required, add columns or a second line per category with percentages:
  - Decide whether percentages are of **all cases including missing** or of **valid responses only (1–5)**, and apply consistently.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means): all match
Your final “Mean” row matches the true table for all genres (to the displayed precision). No corrections needed there.

---

## 5) Column categories (genres): match, but formatting is misleading
All **18 genre columns** in Generated Results match the true set:
Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber; Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk; Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel.

However, the generated table **does not label the rows**, which makes it easy to misinterpret the 6th and 7th rows.

**How to fix**
- Add a first column “Attitude” with explicit row labels exactly as in the true table.

---

## What the generated table must change to match the true table exactly

1) Insert correct rows and labels:
- Add row: “(M) Don’t know much about it” with the true counts.
- Add row: “(M) No answer” with the true counts.
- Delete the all-zero row.

2) Replace your current 6th-row values with the true “Don’t know much about it” counts:
- Latin 221, Jazz 38, Blues 56, Show 77, Oldies 41, Classical 66,
- Reggae 295, Swing 164, NewAge 292, Opera 83, Bluegrass 163, Folk 78,
- Pop 72, ContRock 50, Rap 61, Metal 70, Country 22, Gospel 35.

3) Add the “No answer” row (instead of zeros):
- Latin 12, Jazz 15, Blues 12, Show 14, Oldies 10, Classical 11,
- Reggae 11, Swing 12, NewAge 14, Opera 13, Bluegrass 11, Folk 12,
- Pop 13, ContRock 12, Rap 11, Metal 10, Country 10, Gospel 12.

After those fixes, the generated frequency table will align with the true Table 3.
