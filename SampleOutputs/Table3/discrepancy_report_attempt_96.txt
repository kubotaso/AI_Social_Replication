Score: 70/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / categories mismatches

### A. Missing response categories are incorrectly shown as zero
In the **Generated Results**, the entire row:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**  

is shown as **0 for every genre**.

In the **True Results**, this row exists and has **nonzero counts for all 18 genres** (e.g., Latin/Salsa=221; Jazz=38; … Gospel=35).

**Fix:** Replace the generated “Don’t know much about it” row with the true counts (listed in Section 2 below).

---

### B. “(M) No answer” row is completely wrong
The **Generated Results** include a “(M) No answer” row, but the counts do not match the true table for **any genre** (they’re massively inflated—often by hundreds—when true values are ~10–15).

**Fix:** Replace the generated “No answer” row with the true “No answer” counts (listed below).

---

### C. Column/category structure issue (naming)
The generated header contains **“New Age/Space Opera”** as one combined label.

In the true table, the columns are:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera** (a separate column)

**Fix:** Split the generated combined column into **two distinct columns**:
- New Age/Space
- Opera

Even though the generated table *does* display two numeric columns (“New Age/Space” and “Opera”) in the middle, the **header string is wrong/misaligned** and should match the true structure exactly.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

### Rows (1)–(5): Like/Dislike categories
For all genres, the counts for:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much

**match exactly** between Generated and True.

So the **only frequency-count errors** are in the two missing-data rows.

---

### A. Entire “Don’t know much about it” row is wrong (all genres)

Generated = 0 for all; True values are:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix:** Insert these counts into the generated table’s “Don’t know much about it” row.

---

### B. Entire “No answer” row is wrong (all genres)

Generated values are very large (e.g., Latin/Salsa=233), but True values are small (~10–15). True counts are:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the generated “No answer” counts with these true values.

---

## 3) Percentages
Neither table shows percentages. So:
- There are **no percentage mismatches to audit**
- If percentages are needed, they must be computed from the correct totals (see next section), *after* fixing the missing-data rows.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (Means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The **Mean** row matches exactly for all genres between Generated and True.

So there are **no mean mismatches**.

### Implied totals / sample sizes (important discrepancy)
Even though totals are not explicitly printed, the generated table **implicitly changes the N** because it sets “Don’t know” to 0 and inflates “No answer.”

For example, Latin/Salsa:
- True total = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total = 85+325+416+403+144+0+233 = **1606**

So the *total N stays the same*, but the **distribution of missing-data categories is wrong**.

**Fix:** Correct the two missingness rows; totals will still align, but the missingness breakdown will match the true table.

---

## 5) What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1) **Replace the entire “(M) Don’t know much about it” row** with the true counts (nonzero for all genres).
2) **Replace the entire “(M) No answer” row** with the true counts (≈10–15 per genre).
3) **Correct the column labeling/structure** so “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are clearly separate columns (not a merged “New Age/Space Opera” label).
4) Leave rows (1)–(5) and the **Mean** row as-is, since they already match.

If you want, I can rewrite the full corrected generated table in the same single-panel format as your “Generated Results” so it exactly matches the True Results.
