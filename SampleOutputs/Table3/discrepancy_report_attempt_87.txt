Score: 61/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches and fixes

### A. Missing rows in the generated table
The **generated results incorrectly show zeros** for both missing-data categories:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**: generated = 0 for every genre  
- **(M) No answer**: generated = 0 for every genre  

But the **true table has nonzero counts** for both rows for *every* genre.

**Fix:** Replace the two “(M)” rows with the true counts (see Section 2). Do not set them to 0.

### B. Column/category name mismatch (New Age/Space + Opera)
In the generated header, there is a single combined column label:

- **“New Age/Space Opera”** (looks like one genre)

In the true table, this is actually **two separate genres**:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

And they have **different frequency distributions**.

**Fix:** Split the generated “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**:
1) **New Age/Space** (with its counts)  
2) **Opera** (with its counts)

After splitting, the number of genres remains 18, matching the true table.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

All “Like/Dislike” rows ((1)–(5)) in the generated output **match** the true table **for every genre**.

The **only frequency mismatches** are the two missing-data rows, which are incorrectly all zeros in the generated output.

### Correct values that must replace the generated zero rows

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — true counts
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### (M) No answer — true counts
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Populate these two rows with the above counts (and, if you display percentages, compute them using the correct denominators; see Section 3).

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, denominators)

### A. Means
The **means shown in the generated table match** the true table values **for all genres** (including Rap 3.92 and Heavy Metal 4.12). So there is **no mean-value mismatch**.

However, there is a **structural issue**: if your generated table is computing means from the displayed frequencies, it **cannot** be correct while missing categories are set to zero—unless the mean was copied from elsewhere.

**Fix (logic):**
- Ensure the mean is computed from the full response distribution including categories (1)–(5), typically **excluding “Don’t know” and “No answer”** from the mean calculation (as implied by standard practice and the fact the table reports them separately).
- But the table must still report the correct missing counts.

### B. Totals / base N per genre (implicit mismatch)
Because the generated table omits nonresponse counts (sets them to 0), any totals derived from it will be wrong.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- Generated sum of (1)–(5) = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True table adds missing: +221 +12 = **1606**

So if you compute percentages from the generated table, you’ll get the wrong percents unless you (incorrectly) use 1373 as the denominator.

**Fix:** Use the correct total per genre (sum of all 7 rows). For each genre, the true total is:
- **1606** (it’s consistent across genres in this table: (1)–(5) + DK + NA = 1606)

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column (effectively)
- **Opera** is missing as a distinct column (it’s incorrectly merged into “New Age/Space Opera”).

### Extra/incorrect column name
- “New Age/Space Opera” is not a valid single genre column in the true table.

**Fix:** Replace the header with **two separate columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”, with their respective distributions.

---

## Bottom-line corrections required
1) **Split “New Age/Space Opera” into two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.  
2) **Replace the two missing-data rows** with the true nonzero counts (listed above).  
3) If percentages/totals are produced, **recompute using the full N=1606** per genre (or the correct base if you intentionally exclude DK/NA for percentages—just be consistent and label it).
