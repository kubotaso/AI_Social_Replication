Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing response category counts (“Don’t know much about it”)
- **Generated table** shows **(M) Don’t know much about it = 0 for every genre**.
- **True table** has **nonzero** “Don’t know” counts for **all 18 genres**.

**Fix:** Populate the “(M) Don’t know much about it” row with the true values (listed in section 2).

### B. “No answer” row is wrong (both existence and values)
- The generated table includes a “(M) No answer” row, but the **counts are mostly large (e.g., 233, 306, 176, etc.)**.
- In the true table, “No answer” counts are **small** (mostly **10–15**).

**Fix:** Replace the generated “No answer” row with the correct small counts from the true table (listed in section 2).

### C. Category naming/structure discrepancy: “New Age/Space Opera”
- Generated column label: **“New Age/Space Opera”** (combined).
- True table splits this as **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** as two separate columns (Panel 2).

**Fix:** Rename/split the generated column into **two columns**:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**
and ensure each has its own frequency distribution (which the true table provides).

(Your generated output *does* appear to have two numeric columns’ worth of data after Swing/Big Band—48/186/… and 73/257/…—so the data are already separated; only the header is incorrect/merged.)

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

### For response options (1)–(5): Like/Dislike categories
- **All counts for (1)–(5) match** the true table **for every genre**.

So the only frequency mismatches are for the two “M” categories.

---

### A. “(M) Don’t know much about it” — generated is all zeros; true values are:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix:** Replace the row of zeros with these values.

---

### B. “(M) No answer” — generated values are wrong; true values are:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the generated “No answer” counts with these.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- **All means shown in the generated output match** the true table values (for all genres).

### But: the means are inconsistent with your generated missing-data rows
Because your generated table incorrectly sets:
- Don’t know = 0
- No answer = huge numbers

…those generated missing-data patterns would imply a very different valid N and would typically distort the mean computation (depending on how missing values are treated). The fact that means match the true table indicates:

- The means were likely computed correctly from the underlying data (excluding missing), **but the displayed missing-data frequencies were printed incorrectly**.

**Fix:** Ensure the frequency table generation includes *all response codes*, especially the two “M” categories, and that they’re not being:
- dropped and then displayed as 0, or
- accidentally replaced by something like row/column totals, case IDs, weights, or another variable.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### A. New Age/Space vs Opera column structure
- True table has **two distinct columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.
- Generated header merges them into “New Age/Space Opera” (even though the data appear to include both columns).

**Fix:** Correct the column headers to match the true table exactly:
- … Swing/Big Band | **New Age/Space** | **Opera** | Bluegrass …

### B. No other column categories are missing or extra
Aside from the header naming/merging issue above, the set of genres matches the true table’s 18 genres.

---

## 5) What to change so generated analysis matches the true table (action list)

1. **Insert correct “Don’t know much about it” counts** for all 18 genres (replace zeros).
2. **Replace the “No answer” row** with the true small counts (10–15 range).
3. **Fix the column headers** to separate:
   - “New Age/Space”
   - “Opera”
   (and remove the incorrect merged label “New Age/Space Opera”).
4. (Process check) Verify your tabulation code is including response codes for missing categories rather than:
   - excluding them from the table,
   - recoding them to 0,
   - or inadvertently printing another quantity in the “No answer” row.

If you tell me what software/code produced the generated table (R, Stata, SPSS, Python/pandas), I can point to the specific option/parameter that typically causes the “missing categories become 0 / wrong no-answer row” problem and how to correct it.
