Score: 85/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches in names/number of items

### A. Missing row labels in the *Generated Results*
- **Generated** shows 8 unlabeled rows (6 frequency rows + a “12s row” + a mean row).
- **True Table 3** has **8 labeled rows**:
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
  7. (M) No answer  
  8. Mean

**Fix:** Add the proper row labels and ensure the 7th row is **No answer** (not a constant placeholder).

### B. Wrong “No answer” row (entire row incorrect)
- **Generated row 7** is **12 for every genre**.
- **True “(M) No answer”** varies by genre (e.g., Latin/Salsa 12, Jazz 15, Oldies 10, Opera 13, Rap 11, Heavy Metal 10, etc.).

**Fix:** Replace the entire 7th row with the correct “No answer” counts per genre (listed below in section 2).

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (cell-by-cell)

All “Like very much” through “Dislike very much” rows match the true table (rows 1–5).  
The mismatches are in **“Don’t know much about it”** for some genres and **all of “No answer.”**

### A. “Don’t know much about it” mismatches

#### Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber
- **Jazz**: Generated **41** vs True **38** (off by +3)
- **Show Tunes**: Generated **79** vs True **77** (off by +2)
- **Oldies**: Generated **39** vs True **41** (off by −2)
- **Classical/Chamber**: Generated **65** vs True **66** (off by −1)
- Latin/Salsa (221) and Blues/R&B (56) match.

#### Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk
- **Reggae**: Generated **294** vs True **295** (off by −1)
- **New Age/Space**: Generated **294** vs True **292** (off by +2)
- **Opera**: Generated **84** vs True **83** (off by +1)
- **Bluegrass**: Generated **162** vs True **163** (off by −1)
- Swing/Big Band (164) and Folk (78) match.

#### Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel
- **Pop/Easy Listening**: Generated **73** vs True **72** (off by +1)
- **Rap**: Generated **60** vs True **61** (off by −1)
- **Heavy Metal**: Generated **68** vs True **70** (off by −2)
- **Country/Western**: Generated **20** vs True **22** (off by −2)
- Contemporary Rock (50) and Gospel (35) match.

**Fix:** Replace the “Don’t know much about it” row with the true values:
- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66  
- Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35

### B. “No answer” mismatches (all genres except a few)
Generated uses **12 everywhere**, but True is:

- Latin/Salsa **12** (matches)
- Jazz **15** (mismatch)
- Blues/R&B **12** (matches)
- Show Tunes **14** (mismatch)
- Oldies **10** (mismatch)
- Classical/Chamber **11** (mismatch)
- Reggae **11** (mismatch)
- Swing/Big Band **12** (matches)
- New Age/Space **14** (mismatch)
- Opera **13** (mismatch)
- Bluegrass **11** (mismatch)
- Folk **12** (matches)
- Pop/Easy Listening **13** (mismatch)
- Contemporary Rock **12** (matches)
- Rap **11** (mismatch)
- Heavy Metal **10** (mismatch)
- Country/Western **10** (mismatch)
- Gospel **12** (matches)

**Fix:** Replace the generated “12s” row with the above “No answer” counts.

---

## 3) Percentages: missing (and therefore mismatched vs “true” if expected)

- **True Table 3** provides **counts and means**, not percentages.
- **Generated** provides **counts and means**, also no percentages.

So: **no percentage mismatch**, but if your “generated analysis” was *supposed* to include percentages, it’s missing an entire metric.

**Fix (only if required):** Add percentage columns computed as `count / total_valid_or_total_all * 100` and specify the denominator (include/exclude missing categories).

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means): check

The **mean row matches** the true table to the displayed precision:
- Generated means (e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.142753, Jazz 2.60528, etc.) align with True rounded means (3.14, 2.61, …).

**No fixes needed** for means.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

- **All 18 genres are present** in Generated and True.
- **No extra genres** appear, none are missing.
- Column naming matches the True table’s genre labels (e.g., “Classical/Chamber”, “Swing/Big Band”, “Pop/Easy Listening”, “Country/Western”).

**Fix:** None for columns.

---

## What to change so Generated matches True exactly

1. **Label the rows** to match the 7 attitude categories + mean.
2. **Correct the “Don’t know much about it” row** cells listed in section 2A.
3. **Replace the constant-12 row with the true “No answer” row** values listed in section 2B.

After those edits, your generated frequency table will align with True Table 3.
