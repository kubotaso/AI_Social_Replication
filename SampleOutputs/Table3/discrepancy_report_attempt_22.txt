## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches (missing rows)

### Problem
Your **Generated Results** table includes these attitude rows:

- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- (M) Don’t know much about it → **all zeros**
- (M) No answer → **all zeros**
- Mean

In the **True Results**, both **(M) Don’t know much about it** and **(M) No answer** are **nonzero for every genre**.

So the generated table is **missing the correct “M” frequency distributions** (it has the rows, but they’re filled with incorrect values—zeros—effectively omitting those categories from the analysis).

### Fix
Populate the two “M” rows with the true counts for each genre (listed below in §2). Do **not** force them to 0, and do **not** drop them during tabulation.

Common causes to correct:
- Missing values were recoded to 0 or excluded before tabulation.
- “Don’t know”/“No answer” were treated as NA and then counts were computed with `na.rm`/complete cases only.
- Your frequency routine only tabulated levels 1–5 and ignored non-substantive codes.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/genre)

All counts for response categories (1)–(5) **match perfectly** between generated and true tables for all genres.

The **only frequency mismatches** are the two “M” rows, where the generated table reports **0 everywhere**, but the true table has the following values:

### (M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE counts (should replace zeros)

**Panel 1 genres**
- Latin/Salsa: **221**
- Jazz: **38**
- Blues/R&B: **56**
- Show Tunes: **77**
- Oldies: **41**
- Classical/Chamber: **66**

**Panel 2 genres**
- Reggae: **295**
- Swing/Big Band: **164**
- New Age/Space: **292**
- Opera: **83**
- Bluegrass: **163**
- Folk: **78**

**Panel 3 genres**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72**
- Contemporary Rock: **50**
- Rap: **61**
- Heavy Metal: **70**
- Country/Western: **22**
- Gospel: **35**

### (M) No answer — TRUE counts (should replace zeros)

**Panel 1 genres**
- Latin/Salsa: **12**
- Jazz: **15**
- Blues/R&B: **12**
- Show Tunes: **14**
- Oldies: **10**
- Classical/Chamber: **11**

**Panel 2 genres**
- Reggae: **11**
- Swing/Big Band: **12**
- New Age/Space: **14**
- Opera: **13**
- Bluegrass: **11**
- Folk: **12**

**Panel 3 genres**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13**
- Contemporary Rock: **12**
- Rap: **11**
- Heavy Metal: **10**
- Country/Western: **10**
- Gospel: **12**

### Percentages
Neither table shows percentages, so there are **no percentage mismatches to report**.  
If you compute percentages later, make sure your denominator includes these “M” categories **if** the true table’s percentages do. (The published table is counts; many analyses compute percents excluding missing—be explicit.)

---

## 3) Column category mismatches (missing/extra/incorrect columns)

### Problem: incorrect column name structure
In the **Generated Results**, you have a single column labeled:

- **“New Age/Space Opera”** (combined)

But the **True Results (Panel 2)** has **two separate columns**:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

So the generated output has a **column-category mismatch**: it merged two genres into one column label, even though the underlying numbers appear to be presented as if there are still two separate columns (48/73, 186/257, etc.).

### How to see it clearly
In your generated header you show “… New Age/Space Opera Bluegrass …”, but the body has **two adjacent sets of counts** that match the true table’s **New Age/Space** and **Opera** columns:

Example (Like very much):
- True: New Age/Space = 48, Opera = 73  
- Generated row shows “… 48 73 …” (so the data are there), but the header labels them as one merged heading.

### Fix
Split/rename the columns correctly:
- Create two distinct columns: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**
- Ensure the header aligns with the two separate variables/genres.

This is usually caused by:
- A formatting/printing issue where two adjacent column names were concatenated.
- A parsing step that joined headers with whitespace or removed a delimiter.

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
All **Mean** values in the generated table match the true table **exactly** for every genre.

### Totals / implied N
Even though means match, the generated table’s zero “M” counts imply a smaller total N per genre than the true table. The generated output does **not** display totals, but it is still a discrepancy in the underlying frequency distribution.

### Fix
Once you add the correct “M” counts, your total N per genre will align with the true table’s total (which is the sum of all 7 attitude rows per genre: 1–5 + DK + NA).

## 5) What to change in the generated analysis so it matches the true table

1. **Do not drop or recode “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” to 0 or NA before counting.**  
   - Keep them as explicit categories in the factor/labels.

2. **Tabulate all response codes present in the source (1–5 plus the two missing categories).**  
   - Ensure your frequency table includes those levels even if some genres have small counts.

3. **Correct the column headings so “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are separate genres.**  
   - Verify you are not concatenating adjacent headers during output formatting.

If you tell me what software/code produced the “Generated Results” (R, Stata, SPSS, Python/pandas, etc.) and the original coding for the attitude items (e.g., 1–5 plus 8/9 or 0/9), I can give an exact recode/tabulation snippet that will reproduce the true table.
