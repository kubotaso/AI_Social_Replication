## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/extra rows)

### Missing rows in the **Generated Results**
In the generated table, the two “M” categories are present as rows but filled with **all zeros**. In the true table they are **nonzero** for every genre:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it** — missing (incorrectly zeroed)
- **(M) No answer** — missing (incorrectly zeroed)

So the generated output effectively only reports 5 attitude categories + Mean, while the true table reports **7 categories + Mean**.

### How to fix
Populate the two missing “M” rows with the correct frequencies from the true table (see section 2). Do **not** leave them as zero.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/category)

All of the “(1)–(5)” attitude counts in the generated table **match** the true table for every genre shown.

The **only frequency mismatches** are the two missing-data rows, which are all zeros in the generated output but should be:

### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

### How to fix
Replace the two all-zero rows in the generated results with the correct values above. If your code is producing zeros, it likely:
- recoded missing categories into NA and then dropped them, or
- filtered them out before tabulation, or
- used a “valid responses only” table but still printed the missing rows.

You need to explicitly include these categories when tabulating (e.g., do not drop them; include them as levels in a factor / categorical variable).

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The **Mean** row in the generated output matches the true table for all genres (e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.14, Jazz 2.61, … Gospel 2.39). No mismatches detected.

### Totals / N (not shown)
Neither table shows totals, so no comparison is possible. But note: if you compute totals from the generated table **as displayed**, they will be too small because the two missing-data rows are zeroed out.

### How to fix
Once you correct the missing-data counts, any computed totals/N by genre will align with the true distribution.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories (genre columns)

### Column naming discrepancy
There is one substantive header/name mismatch:

- Generated column header: **“New Age/Space”**
- True column header: **“New Age/Space”** (Panel 2 label) but the full genre in the title is **“New Age/Space”** and separately **“Opera”** as its own column.

However, the generated header line appears as: **“New Age/Space Opera”** which reads like one combined genre. In the numbers, though, it is clearly **two separate columns**:
- New Age/Space counts: 48, 186, 269, 429, 368 (etc.)
- Opera counts: 73, 257, 359, 515, 306 (etc.)

So this is primarily a **formatting/labeling issue**: the generated output header is ambiguous and looks like “New Age/Space Opera” is one genre.

### How to fix
Ensure the header prints **two distinct columns**:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

Use a delimiter or fixed-width formatting so “New Age/Space” doesn’t run into “Opera”.

---

## Bottom line: what must change for the generated analysis to match the true table

1) **Fill in the two missing-data rows** (“Don’t know much about it” and “No answer”) with the correct nonzero counts for every genre (currently incorrectly all zeros).
2) **Fix the column header formatting** so **New Age/Space** and **Opera** are clearly separate column labels (not merged visually).
3) No changes needed for the (1)–(5) frequencies or the Mean row; those match the true table.
