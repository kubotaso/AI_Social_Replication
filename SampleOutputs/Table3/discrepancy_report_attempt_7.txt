Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/extra rows)

### A. Missing attitude categories in the generated table
The **true Table 3** has **7 frequency rows + 1 Mean row** for each genre:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  ✅ *present in true, missing in generated*  
7. **(M) No answer** ✅ *present in true, missing in generated*  
8. Mean

The **generated** table includes rows for (1)–(5), then shows **two rows of all zeros**, then Mean.

Those two all-zero rows are **incorrect placeholders** where “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” should be.

**How to fix**
- Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct **(M) Don’t know much about it** counts and **(M) No answer** counts from the true table (listed in section 2 below).
- Label those rows correctly (right now the generated output has no row labels, only numbers).

### B. Extra/incorrect rows
The generated table has **two extra rows of zeros** that do not exist in the true table (and do not match any real category).

**How to fix**
- Remove those zero rows and insert the real “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” rows.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by category and genre)

### Rows (1)–(5): Likes/Dislikes
For the first five attitude categories, the generated counts **match** the true table for all 18 genres (no discrepancies found).

### Row (M) Don’t know much about it: generated = 0, true ≠ 0
Generated shows **0 for every genre**, but the true table has nonzero counts for all genres.

True “Don’t know much about it” counts (must replace the first all-zero row):

- Latin/Salsa **221**, Jazz **38**, Blues/R&B **56**, Show Tunes **77**, Oldies **41**, Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**, Swing/Big Band **164**, New Age/Space **292**, Opera **83**, Bluegrass **163**, Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**, Contemporary Rock **50**, Rap **61**, Heavy Metal **70**, Country/Western **22**, Gospel **35**

**How to fix**
- Populate the “Don’t know much about it” row with these values instead of zeros.

### Row (M) No answer: generated = 0, true ≠ 0
Generated shows **0 for every genre**, but the true table has nonzero counts for all genres.

True “No answer” counts (must replace the second all-zero row):

- Latin/Salsa **12**, Jazz **15**, Blues/R&B **12**, Show Tunes **14**, Oldies **10**, Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**, Swing/Big Band **12**, New Age/Space **14**, Opera **13**, Bluegrass **11**, Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**, Contemporary Rock **12**, Rap **11**, Heavy Metal **10**, Country/Western **10**, Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- Populate the “No answer” row with these values instead of zeros.

### Percentages
Your prompt asks to compare “counts or percentages”, but the generated output contains **counts only** (no percentages), while the true table also contains counts only.
- So: **no percentage mismatches** to report.
- If your generated analysis was supposed to include percentages, that’s a **missing output feature** (not a mismatch vs the true table).

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The generated mean row matches the true means (allowing for rounding differences):

- Example: Latin/Salsa **3.142753** vs true **3.14**; Jazz **2.60528** vs **2.61**, etc.

So: **no mean discrepancies**.

### Totals / number of cases
Neither table explicitly shows per-genre totals in the generated output. But because the generated output sets DK/NA to zero, any computed totals from the generated table would be **too low by (DK + NA)** for every genre.

**How to fix**
- After inserting DK and NA counts, recompute any totals, valid N, and any derived percentages if you produce them.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories (genres)

### Genre columns
All **18 genres** present in the true table are present in the generated table:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

So: **no missing/extra genre columns**.

### Column grouping
The true table presents genres in three sub-tables (6 columns each). The generated table puts all 18 in one wide table. That is a **formatting difference**, not a content mismatch.

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1. **Add row labels** for the 8 rows: the 7 response categories + Mean.  
2. **Replace the two all-zero rows** with:
   - Row: “(M) Don’t know much about it” using the true counts listed above
   - Row: “(M) No answer” using the true counts listed above
3. Ensure any downstream calculations (totals, percentages, valid N) are recalculated using the corrected rows.

That’s the full set of mismatches: **only the two missing (M) categories (DK and NA), currently incorrectly shown as zeros**. Everything else aligns.
