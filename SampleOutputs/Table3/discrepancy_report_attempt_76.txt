Score: 78/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### A. Missing split of “New Age/Space” and “Opera”
- **True table (Panel 2)** has **two separate columns**: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**.
- **Generated table** incorrectly merges them into a **single column** labeled **“New Age/Space Opera”**.

**How to fix**
- Replace the single generated column **“New Age/Space Opera”** with **two columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- Populate each with the correct (true) frequencies and mean (see section 2).

### B. “(M) No answer” row label is fine, but values are not
- The row categories match in name and order overall (1–5, DK, No answer, Mean), **but multiple “(M) No answer” counts differ** (see below).

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (cell-by-cell)

Below are **every** count that differs between Generated vs True.

### Panel 1 columns (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa: **Generated 198** vs **True 221** (should be **221**)
- Jazz: **45** vs **38** (should be **38**)
- Blues/R&B: **58** vs **56** (should be **56**)
- Oldies: **43** vs **41** (should be **41**)
- Classical/Chamber: **65** vs **66** (should be **66**)
- Show Tunes: **77 vs 77** (matches)

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa: **35** vs **12** (should be **12**)
- Jazz: **8** vs **15** (should be **15**)
- Blues/R&B: **10** vs **12** (should be **12**)
- Oldies: **8** vs **10** (should be **10**)
- Classical/Chamber: **12** vs **11** (should be **11**)
- Show Tunes: **14 vs 14** (matches)

All rows (1)–(5) in Panel 1 **match** the true table; the mismatches are only in DK/No answer.

---

### Panel 2 columns (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)

**Reggae**
- (M) Don’t know: **Generated 260** vs **True 295** (should be **295**)
- (M) No answer: **46** vs **11** (should be **11**)

**Swing/Big Band**
- (M) Don’t know: **150** vs **164** (should be **164**)
- (M) No answer: **26** vs **12** (should be **12**)

**New Age/Space** (cannot match because generated merges with Opera)
- True New Age/Space:
  - Like very much **48**
  - Like it **186**
  - Mixed **269**
  - Dislike **429**
  - Dislike very much **368**
  - Don’t know **292**
  - No answer **14**
  - Mean **3.68**

**Opera** (also cannot match because merged)
- True Opera:
  - Like very much **73**
  - Like it **257**
  - Mixed **359**
  - Dislike **515**
  - Dislike very much **306**
  - Don’t know **83**
  - No answer **13**
  - Mean **3.48**

**What the generated merged column shows (wrong)**
- Generated “New Age/Space Opera”:
  - Like very much **73** (this equals **Opera**, not New Age/Space)
  - Like it **257** (equals **Opera**)
  - Mixed **359** (equals **Opera**)
  - Dislike **515** (equals **Opera**)
  - Dislike very much **306** (equals **Opera**)
  - Don’t know **82** (should be **Opera 83**; off by 1)
  - No answer **14** (should be **Opera 13**; and New Age/Space is 14)
  - Mean **3.48** (equals **Opera**, not New Age/Space)

So the merged column is essentially **Opera’s distribution** (with small DK/No answer errors) and **New Age/Space is entirely missing**.

**Bluegrass**
- (M) Don’t know: **148** vs **163** (should be **163**)
- (M) No answer: **26** vs **11** (should be **11**)

**Folk**
- (M) Don’t know: **76** vs **78** (should be **78**)
- (M) No answer: **14** vs **12** (should be **12**)

(1)–(5) rows for Reggae/Swing/Bluegrass/Folk **match**; mismatches are DK/No answer plus the missing New Age/Space column.

---

### Panel 3 columns (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)

**Pop/Easy Listening**
- (M) Don’t know: **Generated 72** vs **True 72** (matches)
- (M) No answer: **13 vs 13** (matches)

**Contemporary Rock**
- (M) Don’t know: **53** vs **50** (should be **50**)
- (M) No answer: **9** vs **12** (should be **12**)

**Rap**
- (M) Don’t know: **61 vs 61** (matches)
- (M) No answer: **11 vs 11** (matches)

**Heavy Metal**
- (M) Don’t know: **68** vs **70** (should be **70**)
- (M) No answer: **12** vs **10** (should be **10**)

**Country/Western**
- (M) Don’t know: **27** vs **22** (should be **22**)
- (M) No answer: **5** vs **10** (should be **10**)

**Gospel**
- (M) Don’t know: **40** vs **35** (should be **35**)
- (M) No answer: **7** vs **12** (should be **12**)

All (1)–(5) rows and means in Panel 3 **match**; mismatches are only DK/No answer for several columns.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- **All generated means match the true table** *for the columns that exist*, including the merged Opera mean **3.48**.
- However, because **New Age/Space is missing**, its mean **3.68** is also **missing** from the generated output.

### Implied totals / consistency check
- Many of the generated **DK + No answer counts are wrong**, which will also make the **per-genre total N** inconsistent with the true table.
- Example (Latin/Salsa):
  - True DK+NA = 221+12 = **233**
  - Generated DK+NA = 198+35 = **233**
  - Interestingly sums match here, but the **distribution across DK vs No answer is incorrect**.
- For most other genres, even the **DK+NA sum changes**, altering total N.

**How to fix**
- Use the **exact true DK and No answer counts** shown in the true table.
- Recompute any totals/percentages after correcting those counts.
- Add the missing **New Age/Space** column and its mean.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column
- **New Age/Space** is **missing** entirely.

### Extra/incorrect column
- **“New Age/Space Opera”** is an **invalid extra/merged column** that does not exist in the true table.

**How to fix**
- Remove “New Age/Space Opera”.
- Add two columns: “New Age/Space” and “Opera” with their correct frequencies and means.

---

## 5) What to change in the generated table (explicit corrections)

### Structural correction
- Replace:
  - `New Age/Space Opera`
- With:
  - `New Age/Space`
  - `Opera`

### Value corrections (all DK / No answer cells that must be replaced)
- **Latin/Salsa**: DK **221**, NA **12**
- **Jazz**: DK **38**, NA **15**
- **Blues/R&B**: DK **56**, NA **12**
- **Oldies**: DK **41**, NA **10**
- **Classical/Chamber**: DK **66**, NA **11**
- **Reggae**: DK **295**, NA **11**
- **Swing/Big Band**: DK **164**, NA **12**
- **New Age/Space**: DK **292**, NA **14** (plus all other rows as in true table)
- **Opera**: DK **83**, NA **13** (plus all other rows as in true table)
- **Bluegrass**: DK **163**, NA **11**
- **Folk**: DK **78**, NA **12**
- **Contemporary Rock**: DK **50**, NA **12**
- **Heavy Metal**: DK **70**, NA **10**
- **Country/Western**: DK **22**, NA **10**
- **Gospel**: DK **35**, NA **12**

Once those are corrected and New Age/Space is separated from Opera, the generated table will match the true table.
