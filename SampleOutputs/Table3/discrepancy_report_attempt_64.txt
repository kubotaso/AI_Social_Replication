Score: 84/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names/number of items)

### A. “Opera” was mis-handled as a column header
- **True table (Panel 2):** has *two separate columns* **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.
- **Generated table:** collapses these into a single column label **“New Age/Space Opera”**, which incorrectly merges *two genres* into one.

**Fix:** Split the generated “New Age/Space Opera” column into **two columns**:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**
…and place each genre’s frequencies in the correct column.

### B. Response categories are present, but ordering/labeling should match exactly
- Both tables include the same 8 rows: (1)–(5), (M) Don’t know, (M) No answer, Mean.
- The generated labels are fine, but ensure “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” match exactly (punctuation/typography) if you are reproducing the published table.

No other row categories are missing/extra.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (cell-by-cell)

All (1)–(5) rows match the true table for every genre. **All mismatches occur in the two “(M)” rows** (Don’t know; No answer), plus the Opera column is missing due to the merged header.

### Panel 1 mismatches
**Latin/Salsa**
- Don’t know: **Generated 198** vs **True 221** (wrong)
- No answer: **Generated 35** vs **True 12** (wrong)

**Jazz**
- Don’t know: **45** vs **38** (wrong)
- No answer: **8** vs **15** (wrong)

**Blues/R&B**
- Don’t know: **58** vs **56** (wrong)
- No answer: **10** vs **12** (wrong)

**Oldies**
- Don’t know: **43** vs **41** (wrong)
- No answer: **8** vs **10** (wrong)

**Classical/Chamber**
- Don’t know: **65** vs **66** (wrong)
- No answer: **12** vs **11** (wrong)

**Show Tunes**
- Don’t know: **77** vs **77** (matches)
- No answer: **14** vs **14** (matches)

### Panel 2 mismatches
**Reggae**
- Don’t know: **260** vs **295** (wrong)
- No answer: **46** vs **11** (wrong)

**Swing/Big Band**
- Don’t know: **150** vs **164** (wrong)
- No answer: **26** vs **12** (wrong)

**New Age/Space**
- Don’t know: **260** vs **292** (wrong)
- No answer: **46** vs **14** (wrong)

**Opera**
- Entire column **missing** (because it was merged into “New Age/Space Opera”)
- True Opera values are:
  - Like very much 73
  - Like it 257
  - Mixed feelings 359
  - Dislike it 515
  - Dislike very much 306
  - Don’t know 83
  - No answer 13
  - Mean 3.48

**Bluegrass**
- Don’t know: **82** vs **163** (wrong)
- No answer: **14** vs **11** (wrong)

**Folk**
- Don’t know: **148** vs **78** (wrong)
- No answer: **26** vs **12** (wrong)

### Panel 3 mismatches
**Contemporary Rock**

- No answer: **7** vs **12** (wrong)

**Pop/Easy Listening**
- Don’t know: **72** vs **72** (matches)
- No answer: **13** vs **13** (matches)

**Rap**
- Don’t know: **61** vs **61** (matches)
- No answer: **11** vs **11** (matches)

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- **All means in the generated table match the true table** *for the genres that are present*.
- **However:** because **Opera is missing as its own column**, its mean (3.48) is not correctly represented in the generated output.

### Implied totals / N consistency check (important discrepancy)
In the true table, each genre column should sum to the same sample size (within the table’s design).

Because the generated table’s (1)–(5) values match, but **Don’t know/No answer do not**, the **column totals will be wrong** in the generated table. This is a major internal inconsistency and indicates the missing-data rows were miscomputed or mis-copied.

**Fix:** Recompute the “Don’t know” and “No answer” frequencies from the raw data (or copy them correctly from the published table). Do **not** derive them as “leftover” counts unless you are using the exact same denominator and missingness rules as the true table.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing column
- **Opera** is missing as a standalone genre column.

### Extra/incorrect column
- **“New Age/Space Opera”** is not a real genre category; it is an erroneous merged header combining **New Age/Space** + **Opera**.

**Fix:** Replace “New Age/Space Opera” with two columns:
- New Age/Space
- Opera

---

## 5) How to fix the generated analysis to match the true table

1. **Split the merged column header**
   - Create separate columns for **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.
   - Populate **Opera** with the true frequencies/mean listed above.

2. **Correct the two missing-data rows for every affected genre**
   - Replace generated values with the true ones for:
     - Panel 1: Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Oldies, Classical/Chamber (Show Tunes OK)
     - Panel 2: Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Bluegrass, Folk (and add Opera)
     - Panel 3: Contemporary Rock, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel (Pop, Rap OK)

3. **Validate totals per column**
   - After correction, verify each genre column sums to the same N (as in the published table). If not, your missing-value coding or category mapping is still wrong.

If you want, paste how the generated table was produced (code, denominators, and how you treated DK/NA), and I can pinpoint the exact logic error that led to the widespread “Don’t know/No answer” miscounts.
