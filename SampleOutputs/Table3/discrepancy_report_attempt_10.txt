============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/extra rows)

### A. Missing “Don’t know much about it” row (all genres)
- **Generated** table has two all-zero rows where the True table has:
  - **(M) Don’t know much about it** (nonzero for every genre)
  - **(M) No answer** (also nonzero)

**How to fix**
- Add the **“Don’t know much about it”** row with the correct counts from the True table (see section 2).
- Do not leave it as zeros.

### B. Missing “No answer” row (all genres)
- **Generated** table’s second all-zero row should be **(M) No answer**, but it is all zeros (incorrect).

**How to fix**
- Populate the **“No answer”** row with the correct counts from the True table.

### C. Row labels absent/unclear in Generated output
- The Generated output shows 8 numeric rows, but does not label them as (1)–(5), (M), (M), Mean.
- That makes it easy to mis-map rows; however, from the values it’s clear the first five rows correspond to (1)–(5) and the last row corresponds to Mean, leaving the two middle rows intended for the missingness categories.

**How to fix**
- Explicitly label rows:
  1. Like very much  
  2. Like it  
  3. Mixed feelings  
  4. Dislike it  
  5. Dislike very much  
  M. Don’t know much about it  
  M. No answer  
  Mean  

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre)

All **(1)–(5)** counts in the Generated table **match** the True table for every genre.

All mismatches are in the two missingness rows:

### The Generated table incorrectly has **0** for all “Don’t know much about it” counts. Correct values:

- **Latin/Salsa 221**
- **Jazz 38**
- **Blues/R&B 56**
- **Show Tunes 77**
- **Oldies 41**
- **Classical/Chamber 66**
- **Reggae 295**
- **Swing/Big Band 164**
- **New Age/Space 292**
- **Opera 83**
- **Bluegrass 163**
- **Folk 78**
- **Pop/Easy Listening 72**
- **Contemporary Rock 50**
- **Rap 61**
- **Heavy Metal 70**
- **Country/Western 22**
- **Gospel 35**

### The Generated table incorrectly has **0** for all “No answer” counts. Correct values:

- **Latin/Salsa 12**
- **Jazz 15**
- **Blues/R&B 12**
- **Show Tunes 14**
- **Oldies 10**
- **Classical/Chamber 11**
- **Reggae 11**
- **Swing/Big Band 12**
- **New Age/Space 14**
- **Opera 13**
- **Bluegrass 11**
- **Folk 12**
- **Pop/Easy Listening 13**
- **Contemporary Rock 12**
- **Rap 11**
- **Heavy Metal 10**
- **Country/Western 10**
- **Gospel 12**

**How to fix**
- Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct missingness counts above.

## 3) Percentages (not shown) — implied mismatch
- The True table reports **counts** and means, not percentages.
- The Generated output also shows only counts and means, so there’s no direct percentage mismatch to list.
- However, if your generated analysis *elsewhere* computed percentages using only the (1)–(5) rows (excluding DK/NA), those percentages would be wrong relative to percentages computed over all responses including missingness categories.

**How to fix (if percentages are desired)**
- Decide denominator explicitly:
  - **Option A (recommended for attitude distribution):** use **valid responses only** = sum of (1)–(5) excluding DK/NA.
  - **Option B (raw distribution):** use **all cases** including DK/NA.
- Then compute percentages consistently for every genre using that denominator.

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, Ns)

### A. Means: no substantive mismatch
- The Generated mean row matches the True table (to rounding) for all genres:
  - e.g., Latin/Salsa **3.142753 vs 3.14**, Jazz **2.60528 vs 2.61**, Heavy Metal **4.122543 vs 4.12**, etc.

**Fix (optional formatting)**
- Round to two decimals to match True presentation.

### B. Implied totals / N per genre are wrong if you sum the Generated table
Because DK/NA are zero in the Generated output, the **total N per genre** would be understated.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- Generated total = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True total adds DK and NA: 1373 + 221 + 12 = **1606**

This same issue occurs for every genre.

**How to fix**
- Include DK and NA rows so totals match the True table:
  - Total N (true) per genre = sum of (1)–(5) + DK + NA.

## 5) Missing or extra column categories (genres)

### Columns/genres: match
- The Generated output contains all 18 genres present in the True table:
  Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.
- No extra genres appear; none are missing.

**Fix**
- None needed for columns.

## What to change so the Generated analysis matches the True table
1. **Replace the two zero rows** with:
   - Row “(M) Don’t know much about it” using the 18 correct counts listed above.
   - Row “(M) No answer” using the 18 correct counts listed above.
2. **Add/ensure row labels** so the output clearly corresponds to the True table’s categories.
3. **(Optional) Round means** to two decimals for display consistency.
4. If computing **percentages or totals**, recompute using the correct denominator (valid-only or all-including-missing), but do it consistently and state which is used.
