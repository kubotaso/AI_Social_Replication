Score: 65/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

**Mismatch: missing attitude rows in the Generated Results**
- The **true table has 8 rows** per genre:
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
  7. (M) No answer  
  8. Mean
- The **generated output shows 8 numeric rows**, but rows 6 and 7 are **all zeros** across every genre, instead of containing the **“Don’t know much about it”** and **“No answer”** counts.

**How to fix**
- Add the two missing rows and populate them with the correct counts (see section 2). Do **not** use zeros unless the true table has zeros (it does not).

---

### 2) Frequency counts (by response category)

#### Rows (1)–(5): Like/Dislike categories
For all 18 genres, the generated counts for rows **(1) through (5)** match the true table exactly.

#### Row (M) “Don’t know much about it”: Generated is wrong (all zeros)
True counts that must replace the generated zeros:

- **Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66**
- **Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78**
- **Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35**

#### Row (M) “No answer”: Generated is wrong (all zeros)
True counts that must replace the generated zeros:

- **Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11**
- **Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12**
- **Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12**

**How to fix**
- Replace the two all-zero rows in the generated table with these correct frequency rows.
- Also label them properly as **(M) Don’t know much about it** and **(M) No answer** (right now the generated table has unlabeled numeric rows).

---

### 3) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

**Means**
- The generated “Mean” row values match the true means (to the displayed rounding). Examples:
  - Latin/Salsa **3.142753 → 3.14** (true)
  - Jazz **2.60528 → 2.61**
  - Heavy Metal **4.122543 → 4.12**
- So **no mismatch** in mean values (only formatting/rounding differences, which are acceptable).

**But:** if your pipeline is supposed to compute means from the frequencies, the fact that the “Don’t know” and “No answer” rows are zero in the generated table implies one of two problems:
- either the means were computed correctly using the raw data but the frequency rows were lost, or
- the means were computed from a different source than the printed frequencies.

**How to fix**
- Ensure the mean is computed using **only valid attitude responses 1–5**, excluding M categories—*and* ensure the table prints the **actual M counts**, not zeros.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

**Column categories**
- The true Table 3 includes exactly these 18 genres:  
  Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber; Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk; Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel.
- The generated output includes the same 18 columns. **No extra or missing genres.**

**Row labels missing**
- The generated table lacks the leftmost “Attitude” label column and does not name the rows; this makes it ambiguous and also hides that the last two frequency rows are wrong.

**How to fix**
- Add a first column called **Attitude** and label rows exactly as in the true table:
  - (1) Like very much
  - (2) Like it
  - (3) Mixed feelings
  - (4) Dislike it
  - (5) Dislike very much
  - (M) Don’t know much about it
  - (M) No answer
  - Mean

---

## Bottom line: every mismatch
1. **Two missing frequency categories** in the generated output:  
   - “Don’t know much about it” counts are incorrectly shown as **0** for all genres.  
   - “No answer” counts are incorrectly shown as **0** for all genres.
2. **Row labeling/structure mismatch**: the generated output doesn’t label attitudes and effectively collapses/loses the two M rows.
3. **Everything else (rows 1–5 counts, genre columns, means)** matches the true table.

If you want, paste the code/steps that produced the generated table and I can point to the exact place where the M categories are being dropped (common causes: recoding M to missing and then tabulating with `dropna`, or filtering to 1–5 before making the frequency table).
