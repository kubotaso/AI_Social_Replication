Score: 55/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches and missing rows

### A. Missing nonresponse rows in the Generated Results
In the **Generated Results**, two rows are present but **wrongly filled**:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it** is shown as **0 for every genre**.
- **(M) No answer** is shown as **large counts** (e.g., 233 for Latin/Salsa; 306 for Reggae; 306 for New Age/Space; etc.).

In the **True Results**, both of these rows have **nonzero “Don’t know” counts** and **small “No answer” counts**.

**How to fix**
- Replace the all-zero “Don’t know much about it” row with the correct per-genre counts from the true table.
- Replace the inflated “No answer” row with the correct small per-genre counts from the true table.
- In other words: the generated output appears to have **misallocated “Don’t know” responses into “No answer”** (and/or dropped “Don’t know” entirely).

### B. Row labels and genre list
- The **genre columns (18 genres)** match the true table.
- The **attitude categories (1–5 plus two M categories plus Mean)** also match in name/order.
- The only row-category issue is **incorrect contents** for the two “M” rows (not missing labels).

No extra/missing genres or attitude rows beyond that.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

All counts for attitude categories **(1)–(5)** match the True Results for every genre.

The mismatches occur **only** in the two missingness rows:

### A. (M) Don’t know much about it — Generated vs True
Generated: **all 0** (wrong for all 18 genres)

True counts (must replace the zeros with these):

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix**: Populate that row with the above counts.

### B. (M) No answer — Generated vs True
Generated “No answer” is wrong (massively too large) for every genre.

True “No answer” counts (replace generated values with these):

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12** (generated 233)
- Jazz **15** (generated 53)
- Blues/R&B **12** (generated 68)
- Show Tunes **14** (generated 91)
- Oldies **10** (generated 51)
- Classical/Chamber **11** (generated 77)

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11** (generated 306)
- Swing/Big Band **12** (generated 176)
- New Age/Space **14** (generated 306)
- Opera **13** (generated 96)
- Bluegrass **11** (generated 174)
- Folk **12** (generated 90)

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13** (generated 85)
- Contemporary Rock **12** (generated 62)
- Rap **11** (generated 72)
- Heavy Metal **10** (generated 80)
- Country/Western **10** (generated 32)
- Gospel **12** (generated 47)

**Fix**: Replace the entire “No answer” row with the true counts above.

## 3) Percentages
Your Generated Results table shows **counts only** (no percentages). The True Results also show **counts only** (no percentages).  
So there are **no percentage mismatches to audit**—percentages are simply not provided in either output.

If you intend percentages, you must:
1. Compute denominators (likely total N per genre including missing categories), and  
2. Add percent columns/rows consistently for each genre.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (Means)
All **Mean** values in the Generated Results match the True Results for all 18 genres.

However, note an important consistency issue:

- Means are typically computed on valid attitude responses (1–5), excluding “Don’t know” and “No answer.”
- Even though the means match, the generated table’s **missingness rows are wrong**, so the generated output is internally inconsistent (it *looks like* there were no “Don’t know” responses, which would change valid Ns and potentially the means if someone recomputed them).

**Fix**
- Correct the two M rows so that anyone recomputing means/valid Ns from the table will reproduce the reported means.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories
No missing or extra **genre columns**: all 18 are present and correctly named.

One **formatting/name issue** to watch:
- In the Generated Results header you have **“New Age/Space Opera”** as a single header string, while the True Results display **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** as two separate columns (in Panel 2).
- Despite that header text, your generated table clearly has both **New Age/Space** and **Opera** as separate columns (because counts align with both columns’ true values for rows 1–5 and means).

**Fix**
- Change the generated column headings to explicitly separate them: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** (not “New Age/Space Opera”).

---

## Bottom line: what to change to make Generated match True
1. Replace the **(M) Don’t know much about it** row of all zeros with the true per-genre counts.
2. Replace the **(M) No answer** row with the true small per-genre counts (your current values are incorrect and appear to be misallocated “Don’t know”).
3. Correct the header so **New Age/Space** and **Opera** are clearly separated.

Everything else (rows 1–5 and means; the genre set) already matches the True Results.
