## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing attitude rows in the generated table
The **true Table 3** has **8 rows** per genre block:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

The **generated results show 8 numeric rows**, but rows 6 and 7 are **all zeros** for every genre. Those correspond to the two “M” rows, and they are **incorrectly zeroed out**.

**Fix:** Populate row 6 with the true “Don’t know much about it” counts and row 7 with the true “No answer” counts (see section 2).

### B. Missing row labels
The generated output shows only numbers with no row labels (e.g., it doesn’t indicate which row is “Like it”, etc.). The true table includes explicit labels.

**Fix:** Add the row labels exactly as in the true table:  
`(1) Like very much`, `(2) Like it`, `(3) Mixed feelings`, `(4) Dislike it`, `(5) Dislike very much`, `(M) Don’t know much about it`, `(M) No answer`, `Mean`.

### C. Percentages are missing
Your checklist asks to compare “frequency counts or percentages.” The **true table shows counts only** (no percentages). The generated output also shows counts only. So there is **no percentage mismatch**—percentages are simply **not present in either**.

**Fix (only if your analysis requires %):** Add percentage columns computed with the correct denominator (see note under “totals/denominators” below).

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre and response category)

All categories (1)–(5) match perfectly between generated and true tables.  
**Every mismatch is in the two missing-data rows:**

- **Row 6 should be “(M) Don’t know much about it”** but generated has `0` for all genres.
- **Row 7 should be “(M) No answer”** but generated has `0` for all genres.

### Correct values that must replace the generated zeros

#### (M) Don’t know much about it (Row 6) — true counts
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### (M) No answer (Row 7) — true counts
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the two all-zero rows in the generated table with the exact counts above.

---

## 3) Summary statistic mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### A. Means
The generated “Mean” row matches the true means (allowing for rounding differences). Examples:

- Latin/Salsa: generated **3.142753** vs true **3.14**
- Jazz: generated **2.60528** vs true **2.61**
- Heavy Metal: generated **4.122543** vs true **4.12**

So **no mean-value mismatch**—only **format/rounding** differences.

**Fix (formatting):** Round to two decimals to match the published table.

### B. Totals / denominators (important if you compute percentages)
Because the generated table sets DK/NA to zero, any computed totals would be wrong if you rely on generated rows 6–7.

For example, Latin/Salsa total **should be**:  
85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**  
But the generated non-missing-only total would be:  
85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**

**Fix:** When computing totals/percentages, include DK and NA if you want “all respondents” totals, or explicitly exclude them if you want “valid responses” totals—just be consistent and label it.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### A. Columns (genres)
The generated output includes exactly the **18 genres** and their names align with the true table:

Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber; Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk; Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel.

No genre is missing or extra.

### B. Missing separation into 3 subtables
The true output displays genres in three 6-column blocks; the generated output shows all 18 at once. That’s not a numerical error, but it is a **presentation mismatch**.

**Fix (presentation):** Split into the same three panels (or keep wide format but ensure labeling is clear).

---

## Why the generated analysis diverged & how to correct the pipeline

### Likely cause
The DK/NA rows were probably treated as:
- missing values and dropped before tabulation, **or**
- present but recoded to 0 (incorrect), **or**
- your tabulation code only enumerated levels 1–5 and ignored “M” categories.

### Concrete fix
When building the frequency table, explicitly include **all response codes**, e.g.:
- 1–5 plus separate codes for “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” (however they’re encoded in your raw data).
- Do **not** coerce them to 0; they are categories, not numeric values in the same scale.

If you also compute means, compute them **only on valid 1–5 responses** (as is standard for Likert means), and report DK/NA separately (as the true table does).

---

### Minimal checklist to make generated match true Table 3
1. Add row labels for all 8 rows.
2. Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct DK and NA counts (listed above).
3. Round means to two decimals for display.
4. (Optional) If adding percentages, use the correct denominator and specify whether DK/NA are included.
