Score: 70/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names, number of items)

**Mismatch: Missing response rows in the Generated Results**
- The **true table has 8 rows** per genre:
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
  7. (M) No answer  
  8. Mean
- The **generated table shows only 8 rows**, but rows 6 and 7 are **all zeros**, meaning the categories **exist structurally** but the **values are missing/incorrect**.
- Also, the generated output **does not label** the rows (so it’s unclear which row is which), but by position it appears to intend the same 5 attitude rows + 2 missing rows + mean.

**How to fix**
- Include the two “missing” categories with correct counts:
  - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - **(M) No answer**
- Add explicit row labels (otherwise it’s impossible to verify which row is which without guessing by order).

### 2) Frequency counts: every mismatch

#### A) Panels/genres where Generated counts match True counts
For the first five attitude categories **(1)–(5)**, the generated table matches the true table for all genres shown.  
Examples checked across panels:
- Latin/Salsa (rows 1–5): 85, 325, 416, 403, 144 match.
- Reggae (rows 1–5): 84, 362, 340, 297, 217 match.
- Heavy Metal (rows 1–5): 48, 123, 189, 400, 766 match.
So the problem is **not** with the main 1–5 attitude counts.

#### B) Missing-category rows are wrong for *every genre*
In the generated table:
- Row 6 = all **0.000**
- Row 7 = all **0.000**

In the true table, those rows are **nonzero for every genre**.

Below are **all mismatches** (Generated → True):

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)**
- Don’t know much about it:
  - Latin/Salsa: **0 → 221**
  - Jazz: **0 → 38**
  - Blues/R&B: **0 → 56**
  - Show Tunes: **0 → 77**
  - Oldies: **0 → 41**
  - Classical/Chamber: **0 → 66**
- No answer:
  - Latin/Salsa: **0 → 12**
  - Jazz: **0 → 15**
  - Blues/R&B: **0 → 12**
  - Show Tunes: **0 → 14**
  - Oldies: **0 → 10**
  - Classical/Chamber: **0 → 11**

**Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)**
- Don’t know much about it:
  - Reggae: **0 → 295**
  - Swing/Big Band: **0 → 164**
  - New Age/Space: **0 → 292**
  - Opera: **0 → 83**
  - Bluegrass: **0 → 163**
  - Folk: **0 → 78**
- No answer:
  - Reggae: **0 → 11**
  - Swing/Big Band: **0 → 12**
  - New Age/Space: **0 → 14**
  - Opera: **0 → 13**
  - Bluegrass: **0 → 11**
  - Folk: **0 → 12**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)**
- Don’t know much about it:
  - Pop/Easy Listening: **0 → 72**
  - Contemporary Rock: **0 → 50**
  - Rap: **0 → 61**
  - Heavy Metal: **0 → 70**
  - Country/Western: **0 → 22**
  - Gospel: **0 → 35**
- No answer:
  - Pop/Easy Listening: **0 → 13**
  - Contemporary Rock: **0 → 12**
  - Rap: **0 → 11**
  - Heavy Metal: **0 → 10**
  - Country/Western: **0 → 10**
  - Gospel: **0 → 12**

**How to fix**
- Populate rows 6 and 7 with the correct counts from the true table (above).
- If these were computed from microdata: ensure missing codes (e.g., DK/NA) were not dropped or recoded to 0.

---

### 3) Percentages: missing entirely
**Mismatch: Generated Results provide no percentages**, while your instructions ask to check “frequency counts or percentages.” The true table shown is counts (no percentages), so:
- If the “generated” output was supposed to include **percentages**, they are missing.
- If only **counts** were required, then this is fine—but then don’t claim percentages.

**How to fix**
- Either (a) add percentage columns consistently for each genre, including missing categories, or (b) clarify that the table is counts only.

---

### 4) Summary statistics (Means)

**Means match (within rounding)**
Generated mean row:
- Latin/Salsa 3.143 vs True 3.14 (rounding)
- Jazz 2.605 vs 2.61 (rounding)
- Blues/R&B 2.5 vs 2.50 (match)
- Show Tunes 2.594 vs 2.59 (rounding)
- Oldies 2.246 vs 2.25 (rounding)
- Classical/Chamber 2.67 vs 2.67 (match)
…and similarly for Panels 2 and 3 (all match within rounding differences).

**But: the means are inconsistent with the generated “missing rows = 0”**
If rows 6 and 7 were truly zero, the mean would typically be computed over only rows 1–5, or the total N would change; but the means shown match the true table, implying the mean was computed correctly (likely from the real distribution), while the missing rows were incorrectly printed as zeros.

**How to fix**
- Ensure the same underlying distribution used to compute the mean is also used to print the missing-category frequencies.
- If the mean is computed excluding missing categories, that’s fine—but you still must report the missing counts correctly.

### 5) Missing or extra column categories

**Columns match**
- All **18 genres** appear in the generated header:
  - Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber,
  - Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk,
  - Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel
This matches the true table’s 18 genres (across its three panels).

**How to fix (minor presentation issue)**
- The true table is split into panels of 6 columns; generated output is a single wide table. That’s not wrong, but you should ensure it’s readable and labeled.

---

## Bottom line: what’s wrong and how to make Generated match True

### What’s wrong
1. **Rows for “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” are present but filled with zeros for every genre** (major error).
2. **Row labels are missing**, making interpretation ambiguous.
3. **Percentages are not provided** (only an issue if they were expected).

### What to change
- Replace the two zero rows with the true counts for:
  - (M) Don’t know much about it
  - (M) No answer
- Add row labels.
- If needed, add percentages (computed using a clearly stated denominator—typically total including missing, or total excluding missing; but be consistent).

If you want, I can rewrite the generated table into the exact true format (3 panels with labeled rows) using the correct values.
