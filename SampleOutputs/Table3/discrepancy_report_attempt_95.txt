============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing and incorrect rows

### A. Missing attitude categories in the generated table
The **true Table 3** has **8 rows per genre**:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

Your **generated output shows 8 rows**, but rows 6–7 are wrong:

- Row 6 in the generated table contains numbers that **do not match “Don’t know much about it”** (e.g., Jazz shows 53 but true is 38; Latin/Salsa shows 233 but true is 221).
- Row 7 in the generated table is **all zeros**, but it should be the **“No answer”** row with small nonzero counts.

**Fix:** Add the two missing/incorrect “M” rows exactly as in the true table:
- Row 6 must be **Don’t know much about it**
- Row 7 must be **No answer**
…and remove the erroneous all-zero row.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

### Rows 1–5 (Like → Dislike very much)
These appear to **match perfectly** across all 18 genres (no discrepancies found in rows 1–5).

### Row 6: “Don’t know much about it” — mismatched for every genre
The generated row 6 values are wrong across the board. Here are the **true values** that should replace the generated row 6:

- Latin/Salsa **221** (generated 233)
- Jazz **38** (generated 53)
- Blues/R&B **56** (generated 68)
- Show Tunes **77** (generated 91)
- Oldies **41** (generated 51)
- Classical/Chamber **66** (generated 77)
- Reggae **295** (generated 306)
- Swing/Big Band **164** (generated 176)
- New Age/Space **292** (generated 306)
- Opera **83** (generated 96)
- Bluegrass **163** (generated 174)
- Folk **78** (generated 90)
- Pop/Easy Listening **72** (generated 85)
- Contemporary Rock **50** (generated 62)
- Rap **61** (generated 72)
- Heavy Metal **70** (generated 80)
- Country/Western **22** (generated 32)
- Gospel **35** (generated 47)

**Fix:** Replace the entire generated row 6 with these true “Don’t know much about it” counts.

### Row 7: “No answer” — completely missing (replaced by zeros)
Generated row 7 is all **0**, but the true table has these **nonzero** counts:

- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the all-zero row with the “No answer” counts above.

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
The mean row in the generated results matches the true table (to the displayed precision):

- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 → 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 → 2.61  
- Blues/R&B 2.5 → 2.50  
- …  
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 → 4.12  
- Gospel 2.394484 → 2.39  

No mean discrepancies detected.

### Totals / implied N (not printed, but checkable)
Even though totals aren’t shown explicitly, the incorrect “M” rows cause the **overall counts per genre** in the generated table to be wrong (because row 6 and row 7 are part of the total distribution).

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total = 85+325+416+403+144+221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total = 85+325+416+403+144+233+0 = **1606** (coincidentally same here)
But this “matching total” is misleading: it happens only because the generated row 6 is inflated and row 7 is zeroed out. For other genres, the same pattern may or may not preserve totals, but **the category breakdown is still wrong**.

**Fix:** Correct row 6 and row 7 as above so both **category counts** and **any computed totals/percentages** align with the true table.

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns/genres
The generated table includes the same **18 genres** as the true table:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No missing/extra genre columns detected.

### Percentages
The true table presents **counts and means** (no percentages shown). The generated output also shows counts and mean (no percentages). So there’s no mismatch on “percent columns”—they simply aren’t present in either.

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table (minimal action list)

1. **Replace generated row 6** with the true “(M) Don’t know much about it” counts (list above).
2. **Replace generated row 7 (all zeros)** with the true “(M) No answer” counts (list above).
3. Keep rows 1–5 and the mean row as-is (they already match).
4. If you compute percentages later, recompute them after fixing rows 6–7, using the correct per-genre denominators (typically including the M categories unless the true analysis explicitly excludes them).
