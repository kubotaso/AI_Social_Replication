Score: 73/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches

### A. Generated table **collapses two true columns into one**
- **Generated column header:** `New Age/Space Opera`
- **True table has two separate columns:** `New Age/Space` **and** `Opera` (Panel 2)

**Why this is a problem**
- The generated header suggests a single combined genre, but the “true” table treats them as **two distinct genres with separate frequency distributions**.

**Fix**
- Split the generated `New Age/Space Opera` into **two columns**:
  - `New Age/Space`
  - `Opera`
- Then populate each with the correct frequencies (see discrepancies below).

---

### B. Row set is otherwise consistent (same attitude categories + mean)
Both tables include the same 7 response rows:
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
M. Don’t know much about it  
M. No answer  
…and a Mean row.

So: **no missing/extra attitude rows**, but some values inside those rows are wrong.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (cell-by-cell)

All “Like/Mixed/Dislike” (1–5) rows match the true table **for every genre shown**.  
**All mismatches are in the two “M” rows** (“Don’t know much about it” and “No answer”), plus the column-structure issue above.

Below are **every** cell that differs.

## Panel 1 genres (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)

### Row: **(M) Don’t know much about it**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Latin/Salsa | 219 | 221 | change to **221** |
| Jazz | 50 | 38 | change to **38** |
| Blues/R&B | 64 | 56 | change to **56** |
| Show Tunes | 86 | 77 | change to **77** |
| Oldies | 48 | 41 | change to **41** |
| Classical/Chamber | 72 | 66 | change to **66** |

### Row: **(M) No answer**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Latin/Salsa | 14 | 12 | change to **12** |
| Jazz | 3 | 15 | change to **15** |
| Blues/R&B | 4 | 12 | change to **12** |
| Show Tunes | 5 | 14 | change to **14** |
| Oldies | 3 | 10 | change to **10** |
| Classical/Chamber | 5 | 11 | change to **11** |

## Panel 2 genres (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)

### Row: **(M) Don’t know much about it**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Reggae | 288 | 295 | change to **295** |
| Swing/Big Band | 165 | 164 | change to **164** |
| New Age/Space | 288 | 292 | change to **292** |
| Opera | 90 | 83 | change to **83** |
| Bluegrass | 164 | 163 | change to **163** |
| Folk | 85 | 78 | change to **78** |

**Note:** These comparisons assume the generated counts correspond in order to the true columns (`New Age/Space` then `Opera`). The generated header wrongly merges them, but it still provides two separate numeric columns worth of data (one for “New Age/Space” and one for “Opera”)—they just need correct labeling and values.

### Row: **(M) No answer**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Reggae | 18 | 11 | change to **11** |
| Swing/Big Band | 6 | 12 | change to **12** |
| New Age/Space | 10 | 14 | change to **14** |
| Opera | 5 | 13 | change to **13** |
| Bluegrass | 5 | 11 | change to **11** |
| Folk | 4 | 12 | change to **12** |

## Panel 3 genres (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)

### Row: **(M) Don’t know much about it**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Pop/Easy Listening | 80 | 72 | change to **72** |
| Contemporary Rock | 58 | 50 | change to **50** |
| Rap | 68 | 61 | change to **61** |
| Heavy Metal | 75 | 70 | change to **70** |
| Country/Western | 30 | 22 | change to **22** |
| Gospel | 44 | 35 | change to **35** |

### Row: **(M) No answer**
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Pop/Easy Listening | 5 | 13 | change to **13** |
| Contemporary Rock | 4 | 12 | change to **12** |
| Rap | 4 | 11 | change to **11** |
| Heavy Metal | 5 | 10 | change to **10** |
| Country/Western | 2 | 10 | change to **10** |
| Gospel | 3 | 12 | change to **12** |

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- **All means match** the true table exactly for every genre listed.

### Totals / Ns
- The tables don’t explicitly show totals, but the **pattern of errors (mostly shifting between “Don’t know” and “No answer”) implies the generated analysis will produce incorrect Ns per response category**, and potentially incorrect missing-data rates.
- To match the true table, ensure the missing categories are coded and counted exactly as in the GSS table:
  - `(M) Don’t know much about it`
  - `(M) No answer`

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Extra/incorrect column label
- **Generated:** `New Age/Space Opera` (one merged label)
- **True:** two distinct columns: `New Age/Space` and `Opera`

**Fix**
- Replace the merged label with **two separate column headers**, and ensure each has its own correct distribution:
  - `New Age/Space`: (Don’t know=292; No answer=14, etc.)
  - `Opera`: (Don’t know=83; No answer=13, etc.)

---

## How to fix the generated analysis so it matches the true table

1. **Correct the column structure**
   - Split `New Age/Space Opera` into two variables/columns: `New Age/Space` and `Opera`.

2. **Recompute the two missingness rows from the raw data**
   - The generated table appears to have systematically mis-tabulated missing categories.
   - Ensure your coding distinguishes:
     - “Don’t know much about it” (a substantive non-attitude response)
     - “No answer” (true nonresponse)
   - Then rerun frequency tables.

3. **Replace all mismatching cells**
   - Update the exact counts listed above to the true values.

If you want, paste the code (R/Stata/SPSS/Python) that produced the generated table and I’ll point to the specific recode/tabulation mistake that would create this “Don’t know vs No answer” pattern.
