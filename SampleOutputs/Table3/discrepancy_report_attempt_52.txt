Score: 55/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

**Mismatch: missing rows in the Generated Results**
- The Generated table includes these rows but sets them all to zero:
  - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
  - **(M) No answer**
- In the True table, these two rows are **present and nonzero for every genre**.

**How to fix**
- Populate the **(M) Don’t know much about it** and **(M) No answer** rows with the true frequencies (see Section 2 below). Do **not** force them to 0.

---

### 2) Frequency counts (and implied totals)

#### A) “Don’t know much about it” row — Generated = 0 everywhere (wrong)
True counts that must replace the zeros:

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa → Classical/Chamber)**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae → Folk)**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening → Gospel)**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### B) “No answer” row — Generated = 0 everywhere (wrong)
True counts that must replace the zeros:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- Insert these exact values into the two “M” rows.  
- If you also report **percentages**, compute them using the **full N including these missing categories** (see next).

#### C) Totals (N) are wrong in Generated due to missing categories
Because Generated sets both missing rows to 0, its implied sample sizes per genre are too small.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- Generated total = 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True total adds missing categories: 1373 + 221 + 12 = **1606**

This same issue occurs for **every** genre.

**How to fix**
- Recompute **column totals (N)** as:  
  \[
  N = (1)+(2)+(3)+(4)+(5)+(\text{DK})+(\text{No answer})
  \]
- Then recompute any percentages using that corrected N.

---

### 3) Summary statistics (means, etc.)

**Means: appear numerically matching the True table**
- All means shown in Generated match the True means **as printed** (e.g., Latin/Salsa 3.14; Jazz 2.61; Rap 3.92; Heavy Metal 4.12; etc.).

**But there is a methodological inconsistency**
- If Generated truly treated DK/No answer as **0 counts**, then the mean would typically be computed over only the 1–5 responses.  
- In the True table, the mean is conventionally computed on the 1–5 scale **excluding** DK/No answer (i.e., missing).  
- The fact that the means match suggests the mean calculation was likely done correctly (excluding missing), but the frequency table is not.

**How to fix**
- Keep mean computation as:
  - **Use only valid responses (1–5)**
  - **Exclude** “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” from the denominator.
- Make the frequency table consistent with that approach by reporting the missing categories correctly (nonzero), while still excluding them from the mean.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

**Column structure: matches (18 genres), but one header is formatted incorrectly**
- Generated header merges two separate columns into one label:
  - **“New Age/Space Opera”** (Generated)
- True table has **two separate genre columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**

**Evidence it’s only a header/labeling problem (not the data columns)**
- Generated provides *two distinct sets of counts* in that region (e.g., Like very much = 48 and 73), which correspond exactly to:
  - New Age/Space = **48**
  - Opera = **73**
So the columns exist, but the header text incorrectly concatenates them.

**How to fix**
- Split/rename the column headers so they are two distinct columns:
  - “New Age/Space”
  - “Opera”
- Ensure column alignment so each set of frequencies remains under the correct header.

## Bottom line (what must change in the Generated table)
1. **Replace the all-zero “(M) Don’t know much about it” row** with the true nonzero counts (listed above).
2. **Replace the all-zero “(M) No answer” row** with the true nonzero counts (listed above).
3. **Fix the header**: split “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.
4. If percentages or totals are reported anywhere, **recompute them using the corrected totals** (including DK/No answer), while **keeping means based on valid 1–5 responses only** (which already appear correct).
