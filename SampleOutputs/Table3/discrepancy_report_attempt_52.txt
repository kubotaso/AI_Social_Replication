Score: 60/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatched (missing rows)

Your **Generated Results** include the 5 attitude categories and the Mean row, but **omit two required rows** that exist in the True Table 3 for *every genre*:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the generated output, these appear as two rows of **all zeros**. That is incorrect: they should contain nonzero counts as shown in the true table.

**How to fix**
- When building the frequency table, include *all response codes*, not just 1–5. In the GSS table, “M” categories are separate missing-type responses that must be tabulated (and not silently dropped).
- Replace the all-zero rows with the correct counts (see section 2).

---

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

For the **(1) Like very much** through **(5) Dislike very much** rows, the generated counts match the true table across all 18 genres.

All mismatches are in the two missingness rows:

#### Row: **(M) Don’t know much about it** (generated = 0 for all; true ≠ 0)

You must replace the generated all-zero row with these true counts:

- **Latin/Salsa 221**, Jazz 38, Blues/R&B 56, Show Tunes 77, Oldies 41, Classical/Chamber 66  
- **Reggae 295**, Swing/Big Band 164, New Age/Space 292, Opera 83, Bluegrass 163, Folk 78  
- **Pop/Easy Listening 72**, Contemporary Rock 50, Rap 61, Heavy Metal 70, Country/Western 22, Gospel 35

#### Row: **(M) No answer** (generated = 0 for all; true ≠ 0)

Replace the second all-zero row with these true counts:

- **Latin/Salsa 12**, Jazz 15, Blues/R&B 12, Show Tunes 14, Oldies 10, Classical/Chamber 11  
- **Reggae 11**, Swing/Big Band 12, New Age/Space 14, Opera 13, Bluegrass 11, Folk 12  
- **Pop/Easy Listening 13**, Contemporary Rock 12, Rap 11, Heavy Metal 10, Country/Western 10, Gospel 12

**How to fix**
- Ensure your frequency computation includes missing categories rather than converting them to NA and dropping them before tabulation.
- If the source data codes “Don’t know”/“No answer” as special numeric codes (e.g., 8/9, 98/99, etc.), explicitly map them into labeled categories before counting.

---

### 3) Percentages (missing from generated output)

The prompt asks to check “frequency counts or percentages,” but the **Generated Results contain no percentages at all**, while the true table presents **counts only** (no percentages). So:

- There is **no mismatch in percentages**, because the true table doesn’t include them.
- But if your analysis was supposed to output percentages, then the generated output is **missing a percentage column/section** (that would be a spec mismatch, not a mismatch vs. the true table).

**How to fix (only if percentages are required)**
- Add percentage calculations using the correct denominator:
  - Either **total N including missing categories** (1–5 plus M categories), or
  - **valid N excluding M categories** (1–5 only),
  - but you must match whatever convention the “true” output expects.

---

### 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means)

The **Mean** row in the generated output matches the true table (allowing for rounding/precision differences), e.g.:

- Latin/Salsa: 3.142753 vs 3.14  
- Jazz: 2.60528 vs 2.61  
- … etc.

So **no mean values are wrong**.

However, note a key dependency:

- Those means are almost certainly computed on **valid responses (1–5) only**.
- Your generated table currently implies there were **0 Don’t know / 0 No answer**, which conflicts with the data, but the mean can still match if you computed the mean after dropping missings. So the mean correctness doesn’t “prove” the missing rows are truly zero; it just means the mean calculation likely excluded missingness.

**How to fix**
- Keep the mean computed on 1–5 (as in the true table), but still **report the missing-category frequencies correctly**.

---

### 5) Missing/extra column categories

- The generated output includes all **18 genre columns** and matches the true set of genres.
- No extra genre columns appear.
- But the **row labels are missing** in the generated output: it shows rows of numbers without the attitude labels ((1)…(5), (M)…).
  - That’s a presentation mismatch (hard to interpret), though not a numeric mismatch.

**How to fix**
- Add the attitude row labels in the output table in the correct order:
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
  7. (M) No answer  
  8. Mean

## Bottom line: what must be corrected
1) Replace the two all-zero rows with the true **Don’t know** and **No answer** counts (listed above).  
2) Ensure your tabulation step includes those categories instead of dropping them.  
3) Add proper row labels (and percentages only if your required output format includes them).
