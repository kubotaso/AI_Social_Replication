Score: 69/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: mismatches

**Problem:** The *Generated Results* table is missing two response rows that exist in the *True Results*:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
- **(M) No answer**

In the generated table, both rows are present but incorrectly filled with **0 for every genre**.

**Fix:** Add these two rows with the correct (nonzero) frequencies for every genre (see section 2). Do **not** code them as zero; they are legitimate response categories with substantial counts.

---

### 2) Frequency counts: every mismatch (by row)

All “(1) Like very much” through “(5) Dislike very much” counts in the generated table **match** the true table for all genres.

The **only frequency mismatches** are that the generated table sets the two “missingness” categories to zero across all columns, while the true table has nonzero values.

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — generated all 0, true is:

- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

#### (M) No answer — generated all 0, true is:

- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the generated zeros in these two rows with the true counts above.

---

### 3) Column categories: missing/extra/incorrect columns

**Problem:** In *Generated Results*, **“New Age/Space Opera”** is incorrectly combined into a single column header, but in the true table they are **two separate genres/columns**:

- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

In the generated table, the counts under “New Age/Space Opera” match **New Age/Space**, and there is **no separate Opera column**, meaning **Opera is missing entirely**.

You can verify this because the generated “New Age/Space Opera” column values exactly match the True Results’ **New Age/Space** column:
- Like very much = 48, Like it = 186, Mixed = 269, Dislike = 429, Dislike very much = 368, Mean = 3.68 (all New Age/Space values)

**Fix:**  
- Rename the generated column **“New Age/Space Opera”** to **“New Age/Space”** (since the data correspond to that genre).
- Add a new **“Opera”** column with the true Opera frequencies and mean:
  - (1) 73
  - (2) 257
  - (3) 359
  - (4) 515
  - (5) 306
  - (M) Don’t know much about it 83
  - (M) No answer 13
  - Mean 3.48

### 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** The mean row in the generated table **matches** the true table for every genre that is present.

**But** because the generated table:
1) incorrectly sets missing categories to zero, and  
2) omits the Opera column (and mislabels New Age/Space),

the generated output is still inconsistent with the “true” complete distribution. The means themselves are fine, but the table is not internally complete.

**Fix:** Keep the mean values as shown, but correct the table structure and missing-category frequencies so the displayed mean corresponds to a table that includes the proper missingness rows (and includes Opera as its own genre).

---

### 5) What the generated analysis must do to match the true table (checklist)

1. **Split the combined header**  
   - “New Age/Space Opera” → **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”
2. **Insert Opera data** (all rows + mean) exactly as in the true table.
3. **Populate** the two “M” rows with the correct nonzero frequencies for all genres:
   - Don’t know much about it (18 values)
   - No answer (18 values)
4. Ensure the number of genres/columns equals **18** (as in the true table), not 17 with one merged header.

Once those changes are made, the generated table will match the true table exactly.
