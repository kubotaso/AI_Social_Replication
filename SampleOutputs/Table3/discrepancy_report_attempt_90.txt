Score: 70/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### Mismatch: missing response categories in the generated table
The **true Table 3** has **8 rows** per genre:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean

The **generated results** effectively show:

- 5 attitude rows (1–5),
- then **two rows of zeros** (instead of “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer”),
- then Mean.

So the generated table has the right *number* of rows (8), but rows 6–7 are **wrong labels and wrong values** (all zeros).

**How to fix**
- Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct “(M) Don’t know much about it” and “(M) No answer” counts from the true table.
- Label them correctly (don’t leave them unlabeled or implied).

## 2) Frequency counts per response category (by genre)

### Rows (1)–(5): counts match
For every genre shown, the generated counts for:
- Like very much
- Like it
- Mixed feelings
- Dislike it
- Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly**.

Examples:
- Latin/Salsa row (1) = 85 (matches)
- Jazz row (2) = 540 (matches)
- Heavy Metal row (5) = 766 (matches)
…and so on.

### Row (M) Don’t know much about it: generated is wrong (all zeros)
True values (must replace generated zeros):

**Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber**
- Latin/Salsa: **221**
- Jazz: **38**
- Blues/R&B: **56**
- Show Tunes: **77**
- Oldies: **41**
- Classical/Chamber: **66**

**Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk**
- Reggae: **295**
- Swing/Big Band: **164**
- New Age/Space: **292**
- Opera: **83**
- Bluegrass: **163**
- Folk: **78**

**Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72**
- Contemporary Rock: **50**
- Rap: **61**
- Heavy Metal: **70**
- Country/Western: **22**
- Gospel: **35**

### Row (M) No answer: generated is wrong (all zeros)
True values (must replace generated zeros):

**Latin/Salsa; Jazz; Blues/R&B; Show Tunes; Oldies; Classical/Chamber**
- Latin/Salsa: **12**
- Jazz: **15**
- Blues/R&B: **12**
- Show Tunes: **14**
- Oldies: **10**
- Classical/Chamber: **11**

**Reggae; Swing/Big Band; New Age/Space; Opera; Bluegrass; Folk**
- Reggae: **11**
- Swing/Big Band: **12**
- New Age/Space: **14**
- Opera: **13**
- Bluegrass: **11**
- Folk: **12**

**Pop/Easy Listening; Contemporary Rock; Rap; Heavy Metal; Country/Western; Gospel**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13**
- Contemporary Rock: **12**
- Rap: **11**
- Heavy Metal: **10**
- Country/Western: **10**
- Gospel: **12**

**How to fix**
- Ensure the generator includes missing-value categories and does not default them to 0.
- Typically this means: when tabulating, include explicit categories for “Don’t know” and “No answer” (or include missing codes in the crosstab rather than dropping them).

---

## 3) Percentages
The **true table reports counts only** (plus mean). The generated output also reports **counts only** (plus mean). So:

- There are **no percentage mismatches** to check here because neither output provides percentages.

**How to fix (only if you intended percentages)**
- Add percent columns and compute them using a consistent denominator (see note below about missing handling).

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: match (up to rounding/precision)
Generated means (last row) match the true means:

- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ **3.14**
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ **2.61**
- Blues/R&B 2.5 = **2.50**
- …
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ **4.12**
- Gospel 2.394484 ≈ **2.39**

No mismatches in mean values beyond rounding.

### Implied totals / N per genre (not shown explicitly): generated table is internally inconsistent because rows 6–7 are zero
In the true table, each genre’s total includes categories (1)–(5) plus the two “M” categories. In the generated table, totals across rows would be **too small** because the two missing categories are zeroed out.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- True total = 85+325+416+403+144 +221+12 = **1606**
- Generated total (if you sum all 8 rows as displayed) = same minus (221+12) = **1373** (because those rows are 0)

So while the means match, the **distribution totals do not**.

**How to fix**
- When computing totals and producing the frequency table, include “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” in the tabulation output (even if you later exclude them from mean computation).

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns/genres: match (18 genres)
The generated table includes exactly the same 18 genre columns as the true Table 3:

Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No missing or extra genres.

### Structural difference (presentation)
The true output is split into three 6-column subtables; generated puts all 18 columns in one wide table. That’s a formatting difference, not a content mismatch.

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table (actionable checklist)

1. **Add the two missing-value rows** with correct labels:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it”
   - “(M) No answer”
2. **Populate those rows with the true counts** (listed above), not zeros.
3. Ensure your tabulation code **does not drop/overwrite** these categories:
   - If these are coded as special values (e.g., 8/9, 98/99), include them explicitly in the value labels and frequency table.
   - If they are NA in your dataset, don’t replace NA counts with 0; instead, compute NA frequency separately and report it as “No answer” (depending on the survey coding).
4. Keep mean computation consistent with the true table:
   - Means appear to be computed on the 1–5 scale (excluding M categories). Keep that rule; just don’t erase the M counts from the frequency distribution.

If you tell me what software/code produced the generated table (R `table()`, pandas `value_counts()`, Stata `tab`, etc.), I can point to the exact option/argument that caused the “M” categories to become zeros and how to correct it.
