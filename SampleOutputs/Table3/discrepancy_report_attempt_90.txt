Score: 70/100
============================================================

## 1) Row/category mismatches (items and labels)

### A. Column label error: “New Age/Space Opera” vs true split “New Age/Space” and “Opera”
- **Generated** has a single column header: **“New Age/Space Opera”**.
- **True table** has **two separate genres**: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**.
- **Why it matters:** The generated table *does* show two separate sets of counts (one under “New Age/Space” and one under “Opera”) but the header merges them, creating an incorrect genre name and implying one column instead of two.

**Fix:** Rename/split the headers correctly:
- Change header to two columns: **New Age/Space** and **Opera** (not “New Age/Space Opera”).

### B. Missing “Panel” structure is fine, but ensure the same 18 genres exist
- Both outputs contain **18 genres**, so **no genre is missing/extra** in terms of count.
- The only genre *naming* problem is the New Age/Space vs Opera header issue above.

## 2) Frequency/count mismatches (by genre and response row)

All “Like very much” through “Dislike very much” rows match the true table **for all genres**.  
All mismatches occur in the two missing-data rows:
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

### Panel 1 genres (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — mismatches
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Latin/Salsa | 210 | 221 | set to **221** |
| Jazz | 48 | 38 | set to **38** |
| Blues/R&B | 61 | 56 | set to **56** |
| Show Tunes | 82 | 77 | set to **77** |
| Oldies | 46 | 41 | set to **41** |
| Classical/Chamber | 69 | 66 | set to **66** |

#### (M) No answer — mismatches
| Genre | Generated | True | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Latin/Salsa | 23 | 12 | set to **12** |
| Jazz | 5 | 15 | set to **15** |
| Blues/R&B | 7 | 12 | set to **12** |

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- **All means in the generated table match the true table** (for all 18 genres).

### Totals / denominators (implicit issue)
Even though means match, the generated **missing-data counts** are wrong in many places. That implies the **underlying N by genre** (sum across response categories) will be wrong in the generated table. If you compute percentages from the generated counts, they will **not** match the true percentages (even though percentages aren’t shown here).

**Fix:** After correcting the two missing-data rows, recompute:
- column totals (N per genre)
- any percentages based on those totals

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

- **No extra/missing genres numerically (18 present)**, but there is a **header/category error**:
  - Replace “New Age/Space Opera” with two separate columns: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.

---

## 5) What to change to make the generated table match the true table (checklist)

1. **Fix the column headers**: split and label **New Age/Space** and **Opera** correctly.
2. **Replace every value** in:
   - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
   - **(M) No answer**
   with the true counts listed above.
3. If you produce **percentages or totals**, recompute them after the corrections (because the wrong missing-data counts change denominators).
4. Keep the “Like…” through “Dislike very much” rows and **means** as-is (they already match).
