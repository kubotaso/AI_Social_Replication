Score: 70/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches (missing/extra rows)

### A. Missing “Don’t know much about it” row (all genres)
In the **Generated Results**, the 6th numeric row is present but its values do **not** match the true “(M) Don’t know much about it” counts for most genres (details in section 2).  
So functionally, the generated table is **missing the correct “Don’t know much about it” row**.

### B. “No answer” row is completely wrong
In the **True Results**, there is a separate **“(M) No answer”** row with small nonzero counts (10–15ish).  
In the **Generated Results**, the 7th numeric row is **all zeros**, which is incorrect for every genre.  
So the generated output is **missing the “No answer” row values** (and replaces them with zeros).

### C. Percentages are absent (if expected)
Your checklist mentions “counts or percentages.” The true table reports **counts only** (plus means), not percentages. The generated output also contains counts only, so **no mismatch here unless your intended output required percentages**. If you intended percentages, they must be computed and added consistently for all response categories including missingness.

**How to fix (rows):**
- Output **exactly 8 rows** per genre in this order to match Table 3:
  1. Like very much  
  2. Like it  
  3. Mixed feelings  
  4. Dislike it  
  5. Dislike very much  
  6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
  7. (M) No answer  
  8. Mean  
- Ensure rows 6 and 7 are populated with the correct counts (not merged, not dropped, not zero-filled).

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row)

### Rows 1–5 (Like/Dislike categories): **all match**
For every genre, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much

…match the true table exactly.

### Row 6 in Generated ≠ True “Don’t know much about it” (many mismatches)

Generated row 6 values are:
- Latin 233, Jazz 53, Blues 68, ShowTunes 91, Oldies 51, Classical 77, Reggae 306, Swing 176, NewAge 306, Opera 96, Bluegrass 174, Folk 90, Pop 85, ContRock 62, Rap 72, HeavyMetal 80, Country 32, Gospel 47

But the **True** “Don’t know much about it” row is:
- Latin 221, Jazz 38, Blues 56, ShowTunes 77, Oldies 41, Classical 66, Reggae 295, Swing 164, NewAge 292, Opera 83, Bluegrass 163, Folk 78, Pop 72, ContRock 50, Rap 61, HeavyMetal 70, Country 22, Gospel 35

**Every genre is wrong** in this row. Differences (Generated − True):
- Latin/Salsa: **+12** (233 vs 221)
- Jazz: **+15** (53 vs 38)
- Blues/R&B: **+12** (68 vs 56)
- Show Tunes: **+14** (91 vs 77)
- Oldies: **+10** (51 vs 41)
- Classical/Chamber: **+11** (77 vs 66)
- Reggae: **+11** (306 vs 295)
- Swing/Big Band: **+12** (176 vs 164)
- New Age/Space: **+14** (306 vs 292)
- Opera: **+13** (96 vs 83)
- Bluegrass: **+11** (174 vs 163)
- Folk: **+12** (90 vs 78)
- Pop/Easy Listening: **+13** (85 vs 72)
- Contemporary Rock: **+12** (62 vs 50)
- Rap: **+11** (72 vs 61)
- Heavy Metal: **+10** (80 vs 70)
- Country/Western: **+10** (32 vs 22)
- Gospel: **+12** (47 vs 35)

**Pattern:** the generated “Don’t know” counts look like they accidentally include the “No answer” counts added on top (see next section).

### Row 7 in Generated (all zeros) ≠ True “No answer” (nonzero)

True “No answer” counts:
- Latin 12, Jazz 15, Blues 12, ShowTunes 14, Oldies 10, Classical 11,
  Reggae 11, Swing 12, NewAge 14, Opera 13, Bluegrass 11, Folk 12,
  Pop 13, ContRock 12, Rap 11, HeavyMetal 10, Country 10, Gospel 12

Generated row 7: **0 for every genre** → wrong for all 18.

**Key diagnostic:**  
For each genre, **Generated row 6 = True “Don’t know” + True “No answer”**.
Examples:
- Latin: 221 + 12 = **233** (matches generated row 6)
- Jazz: 38 + 15 = **53**
- Pop: 72 + 13 = **85**
- Heavy Metal: 70 + 10 = **80**
This holds across the table.

**How to fix (counts):**
- Do **not** merge missing categories.
- Compute and report separately:
  - `dont_know_much` (M)  
  - `no_answer` (M)
- If your pipeline uses a generic “missing” bucket, split it back into these two distinct codes before tabulation.

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: **all match**
The generated mean row matches the true mean row for all genres:
- Latin 3.14, Jazz 2.61, Blues 2.50, ShowTunes 2.59, Oldies 2.25, Classical 2.67,
- Reggae 3.15, Swing 2.45, NewAge 3.68, Opera 3.48, Bluegrass 2.67, Folk 2.76,
- Pop 2.41, ContRock 2.67, Rap 3.92, HeavyMetal 4.12, Country 2.32, Gospel 2.39.

### (Implicit) totals per genre will be wrong if you try to reconstruct missingness
If someone interprets generated row 6 as “Don’t know” and row 7 as “No answer,” the missingness breakdown is wrong even though the combined missing total is right. That will affect:
- any percentage calculations by category (especially for missing categories),
- any modeling/filters that treat “No answer” differently from “Don’t know.”

**How to fix (summary):**
- Keep mean calculation as-is (it appears to be using only 1–5, which matches typical practice), but ensure missing categories are not collapsed if you plan to report them separately or compute category percentages.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns (genres): match in names and count
All **18 genre columns** present in the true table are present in the generated output:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No extra/missing genre columns.

## Bottom line (what to change so Generated matches True)

1) **Split missing responses into two separate rows**:
- Row 6 = **Don’t know much about it** (use true counts)
- Row 7 = **No answer** (use true counts, not zeros)

2) **Undo the accidental aggregation** where:
- generated_row6 = dont_know + no_answer  
- generated_row7 = 0

3) Keep rows 1–5 and the mean row unchanged (they already match).
