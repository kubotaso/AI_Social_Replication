Score: 72/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### **Mismatch: Missing response categories (rows)**
- **Generated table includes** the 5 substantive attitude categories plus two “M” rows:
  - (1) Like very much
  - (2) Like it
  - (3) Mixed feelings
  - (4) Dislike it
  - (5) Dislike very much
  - (M) Don’t know much about it
  - (M) No answer
- **But in the generated results, both “M” rows are all zeros for every genre**, which is incorrect.

**True table includes nonzero counts** for both:
- (M) Don’t know much about it
- (M) No answer

**Fix:** Populate the “M” rows with the true counts (see section 2). Do not set them to zero.

---

### **Mismatch: Column/category naming**
- True table has separate columns **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** (Panel 2).
- Generated header shows **“New Age/Space Opera”** as if they are one combined genre, but the body contains two distinct columns worth of numbers (because you see both sets: New Age/Space values and Opera values).

Example from generated:
- Under the header region you have “… New Age/Space Opera …”
- Yet the numbers line up as:
  - New Age/Space “Like very much” = 48
  - Opera “Like very much” = 73  
These are separate in the true table.

**Fix:** Split the combined column label into two separate columns:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (including missing/incorrect values)

### **All substantive (1)–(5) rows match**
For every genre, the generated counts for:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much  
**match the true table exactly**.

So the only frequency problems are the missing “M” rows (set to zero in generated but nonzero in true).

---

### **Mismatch: (M) Don’t know much about it — generated 0, true nonzero**
You must replace the generated zeros with these true counts:

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa → Classical/Chamber)**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae → Folk)**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening → Gospel)**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix:** Replace the 0s in the generated “Don’t know much about it” row with the above values.

---

### **Mismatch: (M) No answer — generated 0, true nonzero**
Replace generated zeros with these true counts:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the 0s in the generated “No answer” row with the above values.

---

## 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### **Means match**
All means shown in the generated table match the true table **exactly** for all genres.

### **But: generated table implicitly uses incorrect missingness handling**
Even though the means match, the generated table’s missing categories are zeroed out. That creates an internal inconsistency:
- If you compute totals per genre from generated rows, you’d get a smaller N than the true table (because true includes DK/NA counts).
- In the true table, those missing rows contribute to the total frequency distribution (even if means may be computed excluding missing).

**Fix:** Include the missing-category counts so totals and distributions align with the true table. If you also report percentages, ensure the denominator matches the table’s convention (usually total including missing for frequency distributions, and mean computed on valid responses only).

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### **Mismatch: New Age/Space vs Opera column headers**
- True: two separate columns (**New Age/Space**, **Opera**)
- Generated: header merges them (“New Age/Space Opera”)

**Fix:** Ensure the column list includes **18 distinct genres**, with **New Age/Space** and **Opera** as separate columns.

No other genre columns appear missing or extra; the set of genres otherwise matches.

---

## What to change in the generated analysis to match the true table

1. **Correct the column header**: split “New Age/Space Opera” into **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.
2. **Replace the two missingness rows of zeros** with the true “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts listed above.
3. If you produce **percentages or totals**, recompute them using the correct full frequency distributions (including DK/NA), and compute **means from valid responses only** (as the true table evidently does).
