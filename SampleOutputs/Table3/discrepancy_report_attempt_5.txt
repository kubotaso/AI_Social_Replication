============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/extra rows)

**Mismatch:** The *Generated Results* table includes only these 8 rows (in order):  
1. Like very much  
2. Like it  
3. Mixed feelings  
4. Dislike it  
5. Dislike very much  
6. (all zeros)  
7. (all zeros)  
8. Mean

But the **True Results (Table 3)** has **two additional nonzero categories** between “Dislike very much” and “Mean”:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

**What’s wrong in generated:** Those two rows are present but filled with **0 for every genre**, which is incorrect.

**How to fix:**
- Replace the two zero rows with the correct counts for:
  - **Don’t know much about it**
  - **No answer**
- Keep the **same row ordering** as the true table: (1)–(5), then the two “M” rows, then Mean.

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre)

All five “attitude” rows **(1)–(5)** match the True table exactly for every genre shown. The mismatches are **entirely in the missing-data rows**.

Below are **every incorrect cell** (all places where generated has 0 but true has a positive value).

#### Latin/Salsa
- Don’t know much about it: **generated 0, true 221**
- No answer: **generated 0, true 12**

#### Jazz
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 38**
- No answer: **0 vs 15**

#### Blues/R&B
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 56**
- No answer: **0 vs 12**

#### Show Tunes
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 77**
- No answer: **0 vs 14**

#### Oldies
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 41**
- No answer: **0 vs 10**

#### Classical/Chamber
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 66**
- No answer: **0 vs 11**

#### Reggae
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 295**
- No answer: **0 vs 11**

#### Swing/Big Band
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 164**
- No answer: **0 vs 12**

#### New Age/Space
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 292**
- No answer: **0 vs 14**

#### Opera
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 83**
- No answer: **0 vs 13**

#### Bluegrass
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 163**
- No answer: **0 vs 11**

#### Folk
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 78**
- No answer: **0 vs 12**

#### Pop/Easy Listening
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 72**
- No answer: **0 vs 13**

#### Contemporary Rock
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 50**
- No answer: **0 vs 12**

#### Rap
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 61**
- No answer: **0 vs 11**

#### Heavy Metal
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 70**
- No answer: **0 vs 10**

#### Country/Western
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 22**
- No answer: **0 vs 10**

#### Gospel
- Don’t know much about it: **0 vs 35**
- No answer: **0 vs 12**

**How to fix:**
- Populate those two rows with the true counts above.
- If your code created the two rows but filled them with zeros, it likely:
  - dropped “M” categories during recoding,
  - treated them as missing and then filled NAs with 0,
  - or filtered to valid responses (1–5) but still printed placeholder rows.

---

### 3) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** The generated mean row matches the true table (to the displayed precision) for all genres.

- Example: Latin/Salsa mean **3.142753** vs true **3.14** (rounding)
- Heavy Metal mean **4.122543** vs true **4.12** (rounding)

**But totals / implied Ns:** Even though the true table doesn’t explicitly print totals, the generated table (with zeros for the “M” rows) implies a smaller total N per genre than the true table.

Example (Latin/Salsa):
- Generated total (rows 1–5 only): 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True total including M rows: 1373 + 221 + 12 = **1606**

So while means match (because means are computed on 1–5 valid responses), the **full distribution does not**.

**How to fix:**
- Decide whether your frequency table is intended to include the M categories.
  - If yes (to match Table 3), include them with correct counts.
  - If no, then you must **remove** those rows entirely and clarify that the table is “valid responses only (1–5)”.
- If you include them, do **not** recompute the mean using M categories; Table 3’s mean is clearly based on 1–5 only.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

**Columns (genres):** The generated columns match the true Table 3 list of 18 genres exactly (names and count of columns). No extra or missing genres.

**One caveat (labeling):** The generated output does not label the rows (e.g., “(1) Like very much”, “(M) Don’t know…”), which makes it easier to accidentally mis-specify categories (as happened). The true table explicitly labels them.

**How to fix:**
- Add an explicit row-label/index column with the attitude category names.
- Ensure the two “M” rows are labeled distinctly and not merged/dropped.

---

## Minimal set of corrections needed
1. Replace the two all-zero rows with:
   - **Don’t know much about it** counts (by genre)
   - **No answer** counts (by genre)
2. Keep the mean row as-is (it already matches), and ensure it is computed from 1–5 only.
3. Add row labels so the output clearly matches Table 3’s structure.

If you want, paste the code (or the intermediate frequency table) that produced the two zero rows, and I can point to the exact step where the “M” categories were dropped or overwritten.
