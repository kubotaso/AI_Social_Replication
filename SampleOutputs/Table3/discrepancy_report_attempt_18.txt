============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names/number of items)

### A. Missing response categories in the **Generated Results**
The **true Table 3** has **8 rows** per genre:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

The **generated table also has 8 rows**, but the **6th row is all zeros**, and the **7th row contains values that correspond to “Don’t know much about it”** (not “No answer”). That means:

- **Row 6 (“Don’t know much about it”) is wrong (all zeros)**
- **Row 7 is mislabeled/misplaced (it is DK, not No answer)**
- **The “No answer” row is completely missing** (its counts are not present anywhere)

**Fix:** Add/restore two separate rows:
- Row 6 = “Don’t know much about it” (with the correct nonzero counts)
- Row 7 = “No answer” (with the small counts like 10–15)
and then keep Mean as the final row.

### B. Row labels are missing
The generated output provides no row labels (just numbers). In the true table, each row is explicitly labeled with the attitude category.

**Fix:** Include row labels and ensure they align with the correct counts.

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

### The first 5 attitude rows match perfectly
For every genre, the generated counts for:
- Like very much
- Like it
- Mixed feelings
- Dislike it
- Dislike very much

**match the true table exactly**.

Examples (spot checks):
- Latin/Salsa “Like very much”: generated 85 = true 85  
- Jazz “Dislike very much”: generated 69 = true 69  
- Heavy Metal “Dislike very much”: generated 766 = true 766  
So **no fixes needed** for rows 1–5.

### “Don’t know much about it” row (true) vs generated rows
In the true table, “Don’t know much about it” is:

- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical 66  
- Reggae 295; Swing 164; New Age 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78  
- Pop 72; Cont Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country 22; Gospel 35  

In the generated table:
- **Row 6 is all 0** → should be the “Don’t know” counts above.
- **Row 7 equals:**  
  Latin/Salsa 233; Jazz 53; Blues/R&B 68; Show Tunes 91; Oldies 51; Classical 77; … Pop 85; Cont Rock 62; Rap 72; Heavy Metal 80; Country 32; Gospel 47  

These row-7 numbers are **not equal** to any single true row. They are actually:

> **Generated Row 7 = (True “Don’t know much about it”) + (True “No answer”)** for every genre.

Proof with multiple columns:
- Latin/Salsa: 221 (DK) + 12 (NA) = **233** (generated)  
- Jazz: 38 + 15 = **53**  
- Blues/R&B: 56 + 12 = **68**  
- Pop: 72 + 13 = **85**  
- Heavy Metal: 70 + 10 = **80**  
So the generated analysis **collapsed the two missing categories into one combined row**, and then left the actual DK row as zeros.

**Fix:** Split generated Row 7 into two separate rows using the true breakdown:
- “Don’t know much about it” = true DK counts
- “No answer” = true NA counts

And remove the all-zero row.

### “No answer” row (true) is missing entirely
True “No answer” counts are (by panel):

- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical 11  
- Reggae 11; Swing 12; New Age 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12  
- Pop 13; Cont Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country 10; Gospel 12  

These do not appear as a separate row in the generated output.

**Fix:** Add this missing row explicitly.

---

## 3) Percentages
Neither the generated nor the true table provides percentages—only counts and means. So there are:
- **No percentage mismatches to evaluate**
- But if your generated analysis was supposed to include percentages, then **percent columns are missing entirely**.

**Fix (only if required):** Compute percent per genre using the correct denominator (typically total responses including DK/NA unless the table specifies otherwise). Make sure denominators are consistent across genres.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means match the true table
The generated last row (means) matches the true means (minor rounding differences only, but values align):

Examples:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ 2.61  
- Rap 3.921773 ≈ 3.92  
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ 4.12  

**No fix needed** for means.

### Totals per genre are not shown (but the implied totals differ if you mis-handle DK/NA)
Because the generated table merged DK+NA into one row and also included a zero row, any downstream “total N” checks may be wrong depending on whether you:
- summed all 8 rows (would include the useless zero row, but that doesn’t change totals)
- or treated that merged row as DK only (then NA is effectively lost as a separate category)

**Fix:** When computing totals or valid-response denominators:
- Keep DK and NA separate if replicating the table exactly.
- If you need “valid attitudes only,” exclude both DK and NA consistently.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns (genres) match exactly
The generated columns list the same **18 genres** as the true Table 3:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

- **No extra genres**
- **No missing genres**
- Names match closely enough (same wording/order)

**No fix needed** for columns.

---

## What to change to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Remove the all-zero row** (it should not exist).
2. **Replace the merged “DK+NA” row with two separate rows**:
   - Row: “(M) Don’t know much about it” (use the true DK counts)
   - Row: “(M) No answer” (use the true NA counts)
3. **Add row labels** so the categories are explicitly identified and not confused.
4. If you produce any percentages/totals later, recompute them using the correct row structure (DK and NA not collapsed unless you explicitly document doing so).

If you want, paste the code or the data-to-table mapping step that produced the generated output, and I can point to the exact place where DK and NA were summed or where the row labels were dropped.
