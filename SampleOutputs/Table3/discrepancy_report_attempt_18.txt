Score: 68/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

**Mismatch: Missing response rows in the Generated Results**
- **True table has 7 attitude rows + Mean**:
  1. (1) Like very much  
  2. (2) Like it  
  3. (3) Mixed feelings  
  4. (4) Dislike it  
  5. (5) Dislike very much  
  6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
  7. **(M) No answer**  
  + Mean
- **Generated table includes the two (M) rows but incorrectly sets them to all zeros** (effectively omitting them).

**How to fix**
- Populate **(M) Don’t know much about it** and **(M) No answer** with the correct frequencies (listed in section 2 below). Do **not** treat them as zero.

---

### 2) Frequency counts (by genre and response category)

All frequencies for categories **(1)–(5)** match the True Results exactly.

The **only frequency mismatches** are for the two missing-data categories, where the generated table incorrectly shows **0 for every genre**.

#### Row: **(M) Don’t know much about it**
Replace the generated zeros with these **true counts**:

- **Panel 1**
  - Latin/Salsa **221**
  - Jazz **38**
  - Blues/R&B **56**
  - Show Tunes **77**
  - Oldies **41**
  - Classical/Chamber **66**

- **Panel 2**
  - Reggae **295**
  - Swing/Big Band **164**
  - New Age/Space **292**
  - Opera **83**
  - Bluegrass **163**
  - Folk **78**

- **Panel 3**
  - Pop/Easy Listening **72**
  - Contemporary Rock **50**
  - Rap **61**
  - Heavy Metal **70**
  - Country/Western **22**
  - Gospel **35**

#### Row: **(M) No answer**
Replace the generated zeros with these **true counts**:

- **Panel 1**
  - Latin/Salsa **12**
  - Jazz **15**
  - Blues/R&B **12**
  - Show Tunes **14**
  - Oldies **10**
  - Classical/Chamber **11**

- **Panel 2**
  - Reggae **11**
  - Swing/Big Band **12**
  - New Age/Space **14**
  - Opera **13**
  - Bluegrass **11**
  - Folk **12**

- **Panel 3**
  - Pop/Easy Listening **13**
  - Contemporary Rock **12**
  - Rap **11**
  - Heavy Metal **10**
  - Country/Western **10**
  - Gospel **12**

**Percentages**
- The True Results you provided do **not** display percentages, only counts. The generated output also shows only counts.
- If percentages are desired, they must be computed using the **correct denominator** (typically including or excluding missing categories explicitly). Right now, because the generated table sets missing to 0, any computed percentages would be wrong.

---

### 3) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

#### Means
- **All “Mean” values in the Generated Results match the True Results exactly** for all 18 genres.

#### Implicit totals / N (consistency issue)
Even though the means match, the **table is internally inconsistent** if someone expects the row counts to sum to the sample size per genre, because the generated output wrongly implies there are **no missing responses**.

**Example (Latin/Salsa):**
- Generated sums only (1)–(5): 85+325+416+403+144 = **1373**
- True adds missing categories: +221 (DK) +12 (NA) = **1606**
So the generated table understates the total by **233**.

**How to fix**
- Add the correct (M) rows (above). After that, totals per genre will match the true table’s implied Ns and the means remain valid.

---

### 4) Missing or extra column categories

**Mismatch: A column header is incorrectly merged in the Generated Results**
- Generated header shows: **“New Age/Space Opera”** as if it were one genre.
- True table has **two separate genres**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**

**How to fix**
- Split the generated combined column into **two columns**:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- Then ensure each gets the correct counts. (Your generated counts already appear aligned to the two separate genres in the body—48/186/269/429/368 correspond to New Age/Space and 73/257/359/515/306 correspond to Opera—but the header is wrong and misleading.)

## Complete list of mismatches (exhaustive)

1. **(M) Don’t know much about it** row: generated = all **0**; true = **nonzero values for every genre** (replace with true counts).
2. **(M) No answer** row: generated = all **0**; true = **nonzero values for every genre** (replace with true counts).
3. **Column labeling error**: generated merges **New Age/Space** and **Opera** into one header (“New Age/Space Opera”) instead of two distinct genres.

Everything else (rows (1)–(5) counts and the means) matches the True Results.
