Score: 74/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items / category labels (structure)

### A. Column structure mismatch: **“New Age/Space Opera”**
- **Generated:** merges into one column label **“New Age/Space Opera”**.
- **True:** has **two separate columns**: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**.
- **Impact:** Your generated table effectively *collapses two genres into one column*, but then you still have separate numbers for “Opera” (you show 73, 257, 359, etc.)—so the header is wrong and confusing.

**Fix:** Split/rename the headers to match the true table:
- Change **“New Age/Space Opera”** → **“New Age/Space”**
- Ensure **“Opera”** is its own column header (it already exists in the true table and the generated numbers align with Opera’s row entries, but your header currently implies it is merged).

### B. Row order/categories
- The **row categories** (1)–(5), (M) Don’t know, (M) No answer, Mean **are present in both**.
- No extra or missing attitude rows—structure is fine.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre)

Everything in rows (1)–(5) **matches perfectly** across all genres.

All mismatches occur in:
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

Below are **every** cell that differs.

## 3) Percentages
- Neither table shows percentages, only counts and means.
- So: **no percentage mismatches to report**.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (Means, totals, etc.)

### Means
- **All means in the generated table match the true table** for every genre.

### Implied totals / N consistency issue (important)
Because (M) rows are wrong in many columns, the **column totals (sum across attitude categories)** in the generated table will **not equal** the true totals per genre (and will differ genre-by-genre).

**Fix:** After correcting all (M) “Don’t know…” and (M) “No answer” cells above, recompute any totals (if you display them) so Ns align with the true table.

---

## 5) Missing/extra column categories

- **Missing column separation:** “New Age/Space” and “Opera” must be separate, not mashed into “New Age/Space Opera”.
- Otherwise, the set of genres appears to match the true list of 18 (once you correct that header issue).

---

## How to fix the generated analysis to match the true table (action list)

1. **Correct the headers:**
   - Use **New Age/Space** and **Opera** as separate columns (exact wording as the true table).
2. **Replace the incorrect frequencies** in:
   - **(M) Don’t know much about it**
   - **(M) No answer**
   using the “True” values listed above (these are the only frequency mismatches).
3. If your report includes any **Ns or totals**, **recompute them after the corrections**.

If you want, I can also compute and show the per-genre column totals (N) for the true table and compare them to your generated totals to quantify exactly how far off each genre is.
