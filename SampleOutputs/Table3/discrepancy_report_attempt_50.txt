Score: 75/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### **Mismatch: Generated table is missing two required attitude rows**
The **true Table 3** has **7 rows before the mean** for each genre:

1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean

Your **generated results include only**:
- the first **5** attitude categories (1)–(5),
- then **two blank rows of NaN** (which are not valid output),
- then the mean row.

So the generated output is **missing the actual counts** for:
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

**How to fix**
- Replace the two NaN rows with the correct numeric frequency rows for **“Don’t know much about it”** and **“No answer”** (see section 2 for the exact values).
- Also label those rows properly (not NaN).

## 2) Frequency counts (and missing frequencies)

### **Counts for (1)–(5) categories: match**
For all 18 genres, the generated counts for:
- Like very much
- Like it
- Mixed feelings
- Dislike it
- Dislike very much

**match exactly** the true table.

### **Mismatch: counts for the two “M” categories are entirely missing**
In the true table, the “M” rows are **not zero**; they are substantive counts for every genre. In the generated output they appear as **NaN**, i.e., not computed/not displayed.

**How to fix (insert these two rows exactly):**

#### Add row: **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66  
- Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35

#### Add row: **(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11  
- Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12

## 3) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### **Means: match (minor formatting differences only)**
Generated mean row:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 vs true 3.14  
- Jazz 2.60528 vs 2.61  
- … etc.

These are **consistent** with the true table (the generated values are simply more precise decimals). No correction needed other than optional rounding to 2 decimals if you want to match presentation.

### **Missing: totals / Ns per genre are not shown**
The true table doesn’t explicitly show totals either, but because you included NaN rows, it implies the table is incomplete. Once you add the two missing “M” rows, each genre will have a complete distribution.

**How to fix**
- After adding the two missing rows, you can optionally add a “Total N” row per genre (not required by the true table, but useful for validation). The true counts imply totals around ~1600 per genre (varies slightly by missingness).

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### **Column set: matches**
The generated table includes all 18 genres and no extras:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No column mismatches to fix.

---

## What you should change in the generated analysis (minimum edits)

1. **Replace the two NaN rows** with two labeled rows:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it” with the correct counts
   - “(M) No answer” with the correct counts
2. Keep the existing first five rows (they are correct).
3. Keep the mean row (it matches; optionally round to 2 decimals).

That will make the generated frequency/summary table fully consistent with the true Table 3.
