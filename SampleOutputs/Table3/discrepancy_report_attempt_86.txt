Score: 85/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches

### A. Incorrect / inconsistent “Don’t know much about it” label
- **Generated**: `New Age/Space` and `Opera` are merged into a single column header: **“New Age/Space Opera”**.
- **True**: they are **two separate genres/columns**: **New Age/Space** and **Opera** (Panel 2).

**Fix:** Split the generated combined column into **two columns**: `New Age/Space` and `Opera`, and place each set of frequencies under the correct column.

---

## 2) Column categories: missing/extra/incorrect columns

### A. “New Age/Space Opera” is an extra (incorrect) column name
- **Generated columns include**: `New Age/Space Opera` (single column)
- **True columns include**: `New Age/Space` **and** `Opera` (two columns)

**Fix:** Rename/restructure headers so there are **18 genre columns**, not 17-with-a-merged-header. Specifically:
- Replace `New Age/Space Opera` with:
  - `New Age/Space`
  - `Opera`

---

## 3) Frequency count mismatches (by cell)

All categories besides “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” match the true table *except* the ones listed below.

### Panel 1 mismatches

**Latin/Salsa**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 220** vs **True 221** (off by -1)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 13** vs **True 12** (off by +1)

**Jazz**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 43** vs **True 38** (off by +5)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 10** vs **True 15** (off by -5)

**Show Tunes**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 76** vs **True 77** (off by -1)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 15** vs **True 14** (off by +1)

**Classical/Chamber**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 64** vs **True 66** (off by -2)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 13** vs **True 11** (off by +2)

(Blues/R&B and Oldies match for those rows.)

**How to fix (Panel 1):**
- For each genre above, replace the generated values with the true ones:
  - Latin/Salsa: DK=221, NA=12
  - Jazz: DK=38, NA=15
  - Show Tunes: DK=77, NA=14
  - Classical/Chamber: DK=66, NA=11

---

### Panel 2 mismatches

**Reggae**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 299** vs **True 295** (off by +4)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 7** vs **True 11** (off by -4)

**Swing/Big Band**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 159** vs **True 164** (off by -5)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 17** vs **True 12** (off by +5)

**New Age/Space** and **Opera**
- Because the generated output merges them into **“New Age/Space Opera”**, the “Don’t know” and “No answer” figures are wrong/misassigned:
  - **True New Age/Space**: DK=292, NA=14
  - **True Opera**: DK=83, NA=13
- **Generated (single merged column)**: DK=299, NA=7  
  This does not match either genre and cannot be reconciled without splitting.

**Bluegrass**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 157** vs **True 163** (off by -6)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 17** vs **True 11** (off by +6)

**Folk**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 75** vs **True 78** (off by -3)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 15** vs **True 12** (off by +3)

**How to fix (Panel 2):**
- Replace DK/NA cells with the true values for Reggae, Swing/Big Band, Bluegrass, Folk.
- Split the merged `New Age/Space Opera` column into two columns and set:
  - New Age/Space: DK=292, NA=14
  - Opera: DK=83, NA=13

---

### Panel 3 mismatches

**Pop/Easy Listening**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 71** vs **True 72** (off by -1)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 14** vs **True 13** (off by +1)

**Rap**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 59** vs **True 61** (off by -2)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 13** vs **True 11** (off by +2)

**Heavy Metal**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 66** vs **True 70** (off by -4)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 14** vs **True 10** (off by +4)

**Country/Western**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 25** vs **True 22** (off by +3)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 7** vs **True 10** (off by -3)

**Gospel**
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 38** vs **True 35** (off by +3)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 9** vs **True 12** (off by -3)

(Contemporary Rock also has a mismatch:)
- (M) Don’t know much about it: **Generated 50** vs **True 50** (match)
- (M) No answer: **Generated 12** vs **True 12** (match)

**How to fix (Panel 3):**
- Replace the DK/NA values for the listed genres with the true table’s values.

---

## 4) Percentages
- Neither table provides percentages, so there are **no percentage mismatches to check**.
- If you intend to compute percentages, do so **after** correcting the DK/NA counts and ensuring each genre has the correct total N.

---

## 5) Summary statistics (Means): mismatches?
- **All means shown in Generated match the True means** for every genre listed.
- However, because several **frequency counts differ** (especially DK/NA) and one column is **structurally wrong** (New Age/Space merged with Opera), the means being “correct” is a red flag: it suggests the mean row was copied independently of the frequency table (or computed from different data).

**Fix (for means consistency):**
- After correcting all frequency cells and splitting New Age/Space vs Opera, **recompute means from the corrected distribution** (using 1–5 coding and excluding missing codes, per GSS convention) to ensure the mean row is genuinely consistent with the frequencies.

---

## 6) What to do to make generated match true (checklist)

1. **Split the merged column** `New Age/Space Opera` into two columns: `New Age/Space` and `Opera`.
2. **Replace all incorrect DK/NA counts** with the true values (list above).
3. **Recompute totals (if you report them)** to confirm each genre sums correctly.
4. **Recompute means from the corrected table** (don’t rely on copied means).

If you want, I can produce a corrected “Generated Results” table in the same format as your generated output, with all cells aligned to the true table.
