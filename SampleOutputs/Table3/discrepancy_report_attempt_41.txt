Score: 72/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories (names or number of items)

### A. Missing rows in the Generated Results
The **Generated Results omit two response categories** that are present in the True Results:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the generated table, those rows exist but are incorrectly filled with **all zeros** for every genre, which effectively removes them from the distribution.

**Fix:** Add the correct nonzero counts for these two rows for every genre (see section 2).

### B. Column/category naming discrepancy
In the Generated Results, one column header is **“New Age/Space Opera”** which conflates two distinct genre labels from the True Results:

- True Results have **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”** as **two separate columns** (Panel 2).
- Generated Results incorrectly merges them into one label “New Age/Space Opera” while still showing only **one set of numbers** for New Age/Space and a separate column named “Opera” is not explicitly present—however, the generated table *does* show an “Opera” column positionally as the 10th column (with values 73, 257, 359, 515, 306), but the header text suggests a combined label.

**Fix:** Split/rename headers to match the True Results exactly:
- Use **“New Age/Space”** for the New Age column
- Use **“Opera”** for the Opera column  
Do **not** combine them into “New Age/Space Opera”.

(Practically: adjust the header row so “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are separate and correctly aligned above their respective counts.)

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

All **(1)–(5)** category counts in the Generated Results **match** the True Results for every genre shown.

All mismatches are in the **(M)** rows:

### A. (M) Don’t know much about it — Generated = 0 everywhere (incorrect)
The True Results have nonzero “Don’t know much about it” counts for every genre. You must replace the generated zeros with the following true counts:

**Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa → Classical/Chamber):**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2 (Reggae → Folk):**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening → Gospel):**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

### B. (M) No answer — Generated = 0 everywhere (incorrect)
Replace the generated zeros with the following true counts:

**Panel 1:**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2:**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3:**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

## 3) Percentages
Neither table shows percentages—only counts (and means). So there are:
- **No percentage mismatches to report**
- **No missing percent columns**, because the True Results don’t include them.

If your generated output was supposed to include percentages, you’d need to add them consistently for all response categories including the two (M) rows—but that’s not a mismatch with the provided True table, which uses counts only.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

### Means
All **Mean** values in the Generated Results **match** the True Results for every genre *as displayed*.

However, there is an **internal consistency problem**: the generated table shows **zero missing-category counts**, yet keeps the same means as the True table where missing categories are nonzero. If someone tried to recompute means from the generated distributions (with DK/NA=0), they would generally not match the displayed means.

**Fix:** Once you correct the two (M) rows to the True counts, the means become consistent with the full distributions.

### Totals
Neither table provides totals (row totals or column totals). So:
- **No total mismatches to compare**
- But if you add totals, ensure each genre’s total equals the sum across all 7 response rows (1–5 plus the two M rows).

---

## 5) Missing/extra column categories

### Missing columns
No genres appear missing: the Generated Results include 18 genres like the True table.

### Extra/incorrect column labeling
The only column-category issue is the **labeling/merging confusion** around **New Age/Space** and **Opera** (“New Age/Space Opera”).

**Fix:** Ensure there are **two distinct columns** with exact names:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

and that their counts align with the True table (they already do numerically: New Age/Space = 48/186/269/429/368; Opera = 73/257/359/515/306, plus the missing rows you must add).

---

# Bottom line: every mismatch
1) Generated table incorrectly sets **(M) Don’t know much about it = 0** for all genres (should be the nonzero values listed above).  
2) Generated table incorrectly sets **(M) No answer = 0** for all genres (should be the nonzero values listed above).  
3) Generated column header **“New Age/Space Opera”** is incorrect/ambiguous; must be **two separate columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.  

Everything else (the (1)–(5) counts and the means) matches the True Results.
