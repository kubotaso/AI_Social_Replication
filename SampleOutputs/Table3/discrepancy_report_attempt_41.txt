Score: 75/100
============================================================

### 1) Wrong table/type of output (major structural mismatch)
- **Generated Results** are an unlabeled 8-row matrix with 18 genre columns. It *looks like* rows = response categories + missing rows + mean, but the **row labels are missing**, and two entire rows are shown as `NaN`.
- **True Results** include **three separate regression tables (Tables 1–2)** *plus* **one frequency table (Table 3)**. Your generated output corresponds only to **Table 3**, not Tables 1–2.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match the “true results,” you must output:
  - Table 1 (regression coefficients, constants, R², N)
  - Table 2 (regression coefficients, constants, R², N)
  - Table 3 (frequency distributions + means)
- If you intend to output only Table 3, label it as Table 3 and do not present it as the whole “true results.”

### 2) Row items/categories: missing categories and missing row labels
#### What True Table 3 contains (8 rows per genre)
For each genre, Table 3 has **exactly these 8 row categories**:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

#### What Generated Results contain
- 5 numeric rows (these match the five “Like/Dislike” categories),
- then **two rows of `NaN`**,
- then a numeric “mean” row.

So the generated table is **missing the two “M” rows** as actual counts and instead has **NaN placeholders**.

**Fix**
- Replace the two `NaN` rows with the correct “missing” category counts:
  - “(M) Don’t know much about it”
  - “(M) No answer”
- Also add row labels so the categories are explicit and verifiable.

### 3) Frequency counts: mismatches
For the **five attitude categories (1)–(5)**, the generated counts **match the true table exactly** for all 18 genres (I checked across the columns shown).

The **only frequency-count mismatches** are that the generated output has **no values** for the two missing-data categories (they are `NaN`) while the true table has real counts.

#### Missing counts that must be inserted (they are absent in Generated Results)

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66  
- Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35  

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11  
- Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12  

**Fix**
- Populate those two rows with the above counts (instead of NaN).

---

### 4) Percentages: missing entirely
- The user request asks to compare **“frequency counts or percentages.”**
- **True Table 3 reports counts only** (no percentages).
- **Generated Results also show counts only** (no percentages).

**Fix**
- If percentages are required, compute them consistently:
  - Decide denominator: usually **total responses including missing** *or* only valid responses (1–5).  
  - Then add percentage columns/rows explicitly and label them.
- If matching the true table exactly, **do not add percentages** (because the true table doesn’t include them).

---

### 5) Summary statistics (means): essentially correct, but formatting/rounding differs
- The generated mean row matches the true means to rounding:
  - Example: Latin/Salsa `3.142753` vs true `3.14`
  - Jazz `2.60528` vs true `2.61`
  - etc.

**Mismatch**
- **Precision/formatting** differs: generated shows many decimals; true table shows **two decimals**.

**Fix**
- Round means to **2 decimal places** to match the true table formatting.

---

### 6) Column categories: correct set, but presentation differs
- The generated output includes the **same 18 genres** as Table 3.
- The true table presents them in **three separate 6-genre subtables**; generated presents them as **one wide table**.

This is not a numeric error, but it *is* a presentation mismatch if you’re trying to replicate the “true” output layout.

**Fix**
- Either:
  - split into three subtables of 6 genres each (matching the true layout), or
  - keep as one table but clearly label it as the combined version of Table 3.

---

## What you should change in the generated analysis to match the true table
1. **Add row labels** for the 8 categories (1)–(5), (M) DK, (M) No answer, Mean.
2. **Replace the two `NaN` rows** with the true counts for:
   - “Don’t know much about it”
   - “No answer”
3. **Round means to 2 decimals**.
4. If the deliverable is the full “true results,” also generate **Tables 1 and 2** (regression outputs), which are currently completely missing.
