============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches (names / number of items)

### A. Missing attitude rows in the generated table
The **true Table 3** has **8 rows** per genre block:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

The **generated table shows only 8 numeric rows**, but rows **6 and 7 are all zeros**. Those rows are supposed to contain the **“Don’t know much about it”** and **“No answer”** counts.

**Fix:** Populate rows 6 and 7 with the correct counts from the true table (listed below in Section 2).

### B. Missing row labels
The generated output has **no row labels** for the response categories (1–5, M, M, Mean). It’s just numbers.

**Fix:** Add the attitude row labels exactly as in the true table so categories are not ambiguous.

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by response category)

### Good news: rows (1)–(5) match
For every genre, the generated counts for:
- Like very much
- Like it
- Mixed feelings
- Dislike it
- Dislike very much

…**match the true table exactly**.

### All mismatches are in the missing-data rows
In the generated table, the last two frequency rows (the two “M” categories) are **all 0**, but in the true table they are **nonzero** for every genre.

#### Correct values to replace the two all-zero rows with

Below are the true counts you must insert into:

- Row 6 = **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Row 7 = **(M) No answer**

**Latin/Salsa → Gospel (all 18 genres):**

| Genre | Don’t know much about it | No answer |
|---|---:|---:|
| Latin/Salsa | 221 | 12 |
| Jazz | 38 | 15 |
| Blues/R&B | 56 | 12 |
| Show Tunes | 77 | 14 |
| Oldies | 41 | 10 |
| Classical/Chamber | 66 | 11 |
| Reggae | 295 | 11 |
| Swing/Big Band | 164 | 12 |
| New Age/Space | 292 | 14 |
| Opera | 83 | 13 |
| Bluegrass | 163 | 11 |
| Folk | 78 | 12 |
| Pop/Easy Listening | 72 | 13 |
| Contemporary Rock | 50 | 12 |
| Rap | 61 | 11 |
| Heavy Metal | 70 | 10 |
| Country/Western | 22 | 10 |
| Gospel | 35 | 12 |

**Fix:** Replace the generated table’s two zero rows with these two rows of counts, in the same column order.

---

## 3) Percentages
The true table reports **counts only** (no percentages). The generated table also reports counts only.

- **No percentage mismatches** because **no percentages are present** in either.
- If your generated analysis *intended* to include percentages, then it’s missing an entire set of columns/rows, but that would be a design difference, not a mismatch to the provided “true” output.

**Fix (only if needed):** If you want percentages, compute them as `count / (sum across all 7 response rows excluding Mean)` per genre, and add them explicitly. Otherwise leave them out to match the true table.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### Means: they match (within rounding)
The generated means row:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ≈ **3.14**
- Jazz 2.60528 ≈ **2.61**
- Blues/R&B 2.5 = **2.50**
- …
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ≈ **4.12**

These align with the true table’s 2-decimal means (just more precision in the generated output).

**Fix (cosmetic):** Round the generated mean row to **2 decimals** to match the true presentation.

### Totals / N per genre: not shown in either table
Neither output includes explicit totals. However, because the generated table incorrectly has 0s for the two missing-data rows, any computed totals from the generated table would be **too small** compared to the true totals.

**Fix:** After inserting the correct “Don’t know” and “No answer” counts, totals per genre will match the true underlying Ns.

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

### Columns: correct set of 18 genres
The generated table includes exactly the 18 genres found in the true Table 3:

Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

- **No missing genres**
- **No extra genres**
- Names match closely enough to be equivalent (slashes/hyphens consistent with true table).

**Fix:** None needed for columns.

---

## What to change so the generated table matches the true table exactly

1. **Add row labels** for all 8 rows: (1)–(5), (M) Don’t know much about it, (M) No answer, Mean.  
2. **Replace the two all-zero rows** with the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts (table provided above).  
3. **Round means to 2 decimals** (optional but needed for exact formatting match).  

That’s every mismatch: the only substantive errors are the two missing-data frequency rows being zeroed out (and the absence of row labels/formatting).
