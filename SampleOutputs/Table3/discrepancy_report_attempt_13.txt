Score: 65/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatches (missing/extra rows)

**Generated table is missing two attitude rows for every genre:**
- **(M) Don’t know much about it**
- **(M) No answer**

In the generated results, those two rows appear as **all zeros**, which is incorrect. In the true table, these rows have nonzero counts for every genre.

**How to fix**
- Add the two missing rows back in (or, if they’re already present in your code, stop overwriting them with zeros).
- Populate them with the **true counts** shown in the “True Results” table (listed below by panel).

---

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre × response category)

All five substantive attitude rows **(1)–(5)** match the true table across all 18 genres.

The **only frequency mismatches** are the two missing-data rows **(M)**:

#### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
Your generated rows are `0`s; they should be:

**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

#### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**(M) No answer**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

#### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**(M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**How to fix**
- Replace the two all-zero rows with the correct counts above.
- If you compute these from raw data: ensure your recode keeps “don’t know” and “no answer” as explicit categories rather than converting them to `NA` and then dropping them from the tabulation.

### 3) Percentages

**Generated output shows no percentages at all**, while your prompt asks to compare “frequency counts or percentages.” The true table also shows counts (not percentages), so:
- **No percentage mismatches can be checked** because percentages weren’t generated.

**How to fix (if percentages are required)**
- Add column-wise percentages for each genre:
  - Specify denominator: either **all responses including missing categories** or **valid only (1–5)**.
  - The true table appears to be **counts only**, so if you add percentages, label them clearly and match the chosen denominator consistently.

---

### 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** All means in the generated output match the true table:
- Panel 1 means: 3.14, 2.61, 2.50, 2.59, 2.25, 2.67
- Panel 2 means: 3.15, 2.45, 3.68, 3.48, 2.67, 2.76
- Panel 3 means: 2.41, 2.67, 3.92, 4.12, 2.32, 2.39

**But there is an implied summary-stat issue:**  
Because your generated table sets missing categories to zero, any **computed totals / N** (if you compute them elsewhere) would be wrong, and any **percentages** derived from those totals would be wrong too.

**How to fix**
- When computing totals (N) per genre, include the missing categories if you want to match the true distribution table.
- When computing means, confirm you’re using the same rule as the true table (almost certainly mean over valid responses 1–5, excluding the M categories). Your means already match, so don’t change that—just don’t zero-out M rows.

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories (genre columns)

**Column set matches (18 genres), but one header label is wrong/inconsistent:**
- Generated header: **“New Age/Space”** appears as **“New Age/Space”** in the true table, but your generated header line shows **“New Age/Space”** followed immediately by **“Opera”** with no separator in the first line (“New Age/Space Opera”), which can be read as one combined label.
- In the true table, these are **two separate columns**: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**.

**How to fix**
- Ensure column headers are separated and exactly match:
  - “New Age/Space” and “Opera” as distinct columns (e.g., add delimiter, consistent spacing, or explicit column formatting).

---

## Bottom line
- **All (1)–(5) counts match. All means match.**
- The generated table is **incorrect because it replaces the two missing-response rows with zeros**, and it has a **header formatting issue** that makes “New Age/Space” and “Opera” look merged.
- Fix by **restoring the two M rows with correct counts** and **cleaning the column headers**; add percentages only if required and define the denominator.
