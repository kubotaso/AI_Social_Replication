Score: 67/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories: missing + mislabeled rows

**True Table 3 has 8 rows per genre:**
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
7. **(M) No answer**  
8. Mean  

**Generated table has 8 rows, but rows 6–7 are wrong:**
- **Row 6 in Generated** contains real-looking counts (e.g., Latin/Salsa = 233; Jazz = 53; etc.), but in the true table row 6 should be **“Don’t know much about it”** and the values do **not** match.
- **Row 7 in Generated** is **all zeros**, but the true table row 7 should be **“No answer”** and has nonzero values for every genre.

**How to fix**
- Replace Generated row 6 with the true “Don’t know much about it” counts (listed below).
- Replace Generated row 7 zeros with the true “No answer” counts (listed below).
- Ensure the row labels explicitly include both missing categories (“Don’t know much about it”, “No answer”) instead of leaving them unlabeled/implicit.

### 2) Frequency mismatches (counts)

All rows (1)–(5) and the **Mean** row in the Generated output match the true table for all 18 genres.

The **only count mismatches are entirely in the two “missing-data” rows** (Don’t know; No answer).

#### Row 6: “Don’t know much about it” — Generated is wrong for every genre

True vs Generated (Gen → True):

- **Latin/Salsa:** 233 → **221**
- **Jazz:** 53 → **38**
- **Blues/R&B:** 68 → **56**
- **Show Tunes:** 91 → **77**
- **Oldies:** 51 → **41**
- **Classical/Chamber:** 77 → **66**
- **Reggae:** 306 → **295**
- **Swing/Big Band:** 176 → **164**
- **New Age/Space:** 306 → **292**
- **Opera:** 96 → **83**
- **Bluegrass:** 174 → **163**
- **Folk:** 90 → **78**
- **Pop/Easy Listening:** 85 → **72**
- **Contemporary Rock:** 62 → **50**
- **Rap:** 72 → **61**
- **Heavy Metal:** 80 → **70**
- **Country/Western:** 32 → **22**
- **Gospel:** 47 → **35**

#### Row 7: “No answer” — Generated shows 0, but true is nonzero for every genre

True vs Generated:

- **Latin/Salsa:** 0 → **12**
- **Jazz:** 0 → **15**
- **Blues/R&B:** 0 → **12**
- **Show Tunes:** 0 → **14**
- **Oldies:** 0 → **10**
- **Classical/Chamber:** 0 → **11**
- **Reggae:** 0 → **11**
- **Swing/Big Band:** 0 → **12**
- **New Age/Space:** 0 → **14**
- **Opera:** 0 → **13**
- **Bluegrass:** 0 → **11**
- **Folk:** 0 → **12**
- **Pop/Easy Listening:** 0 → **13**
- **Contemporary Rock:** 0 → **12**
- **Rap:** 0 → **11**
- **Heavy Metal:** 0 → **10**
- **Country/Western:** 0 → **10**
- **Gospel:** 0 → **12**

**How to fix**
- Populate row 6 with the “Don’t know much about it” counts exactly as in the true table.
- Populate row 7 with the “No answer” counts exactly as in the true table.
- Do not hard-code zeros for missing rows; compute them from the data or carry them over from the source table.

---

### 3) Percentages

- The **true table reports counts only** (no percentages).
- The **generated output also shows counts only**.

So there are **no percentage mismatches**—but if your generated analysis was *supposed* to include percentages, then the problem is that **percent columns are missing** (see section 5).

---

### 4) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.)

**Means:** The Generated mean row matches the true mean row for all genres (within rounding shown). Examples:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 ↔ 3.14
- Jazz 2.60528 ↔ 2.61
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 ↔ 4.12  
No corrections needed.

**Other summary stats:** The true table does not include totals per genre, N per genre, etc. The generated output also does not include them. So no mismatch here.

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories

**Columns/genres:** Generated includes exactly the 18 genres found in the true Table 3:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

No genre columns are missing or extra.

**Row category labels are missing in the Generated output.**
- The true table clearly labels response categories (1)–(5), (M) Don’t know, (M) No answer, Mean.
- Generated shows unlabeled numeric rows.

**How to fix**
- Add an explicit first column (or index) named **Attitude** with the eight row labels.
- Ensure the two “(M)” rows are correctly named and populated.

---

## Net: what’s wrong and how to correct it (minimal change list)

1. **Replace Generated row 6** with the true **“(M) Don’t know much about it”** counts.
2. **Replace Generated row 7** (all zeros) with the true **“(M) No answer”** counts.
3. **Add row labels** so it’s unambiguous which row corresponds to which attitude category.

Everything else (genres, rows 1–5, and means) already matches the true Table 3.
