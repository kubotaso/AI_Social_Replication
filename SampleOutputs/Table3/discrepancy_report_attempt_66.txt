Score: 72/100
============================================================

## 1) Wrong table/type of output (major structural mismatch)
- **Generated Results** show only the **18 genre columns** with **8 numeric rows** (5 attitude rows + 2 all-NaN rows + a mean row). There are **no row labels** (attitude categories) and **no regression tables** (True Tables 1 and 2).
- **True Results** contain **three tables**:
  - **Table 1** regression coefficients (3 models)
  - **Table 2** regression coefficients (2 models)
  - **Table 3** frequency distributions for **18 genres** including **7 response categories** + **Mean**

**Fix:** Output must include Tables **1 and 2** (regression coefficient tables) and, for Table 3, include **all 7 attitude categories plus Mean**, with explicit row labels.

---

## 2) Missing row categories in the frequency table (Table 3)
In **True Table 3**, each genre has these rows:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  
7. **(M) No answer**  
8. Mean

In **Generated Results**:
- Rows 1–5 match the first five categories (counts).
- Rows 6–7 are present but are **all NaN** → the **two “M” categories are missing** (not computed/printed).
- Mean row is present.

**Fix:** Populate rows 6 and 7 with the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts (see section 4).

---

## 3) Percentages are missing entirely
The prompt asks to compare “frequency counts or **percentages**.”  
- **Generated Results** include **counts only** (and a mean).
- **True Results** show counts (no percentages either), but your instruction requires checking them.

**Fix:** If you intend to include percentages, compute and add them consistently (e.g., column percents within each genre including/excluding missing). If you do **not** intend to include percentages, remove references to percentages from the generated output/spec.

---

## 4) Exact mismatches in counts: the missing “M” rows
For every genre, the generated table has **NaN** where the true table has counts.

### Row: **(M) Don’t know much about it** (missing in Generated)
Should be:

- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

### Row: **(M) No answer** (missing in Generated)
Should be:

- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** When building the frequency table, ensure the source data’s missing codes are not dropped/converted to NaN without counting. In GSS-style data, “don’t know”/“no answer” are often separate codes; map them explicitly into these two categories and count them.

---

## 5) Means: formatting differs slightly, values match
The **Mean** row in Generated matches True to rounding differences only:

- Example: Latin/Salsa generated **3.142753** vs true **3.14**
- Jazz **2.60528** vs **2.61**
- … and similarly for the rest

These are not substantive mismatches—just precision/rounding.

**Fix (optional):** Round to **2 decimals** to match the true table presentation.

---

## 6) Row labels/categories are missing (presentation mismatch)
True Table 3 explicitly labels rows as:
- “(1) Like very much”, … “(5) Dislike very much”, “(M) Don’t know much about it”, “(M) No answer”, “Mean”.

Generated output provides only unlabeled numeric rows.

**Fix:** Add the attitude row labels and ensure the two “M” rows appear with their labels rather than NaN lines.

---

## 7) No extra/missing genre columns (columns match True Table 3)
The generated genre columns are the same 18 genres as in True Table 3:
Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

So:
- **No extra genre columns**
- **No missing genre columns**

Only the **row categories** are missing.

---

## 8) Completely missing True Tables 1 and 2 (major omission)
Generated results do not include **any** of:
- coefficients (Education, income, prestige, etc.)
- constants, R², adjusted R²
- number of cases
- significance stars/notes

**Fix:** Produce Table 1 and Table 2 as separate outputs with the same rows/columns as the true tables, including:
- identical variable names
- the three/two model columns
- constants, R², adjusted R², N
- significance notation and footnotes

---

### Bottom line: what to change so Generated matches True
1. **Replace the two NaN rows** with the correct counts for:
   - “(M) Don’t know much about it”
   - “(M) No answer”
2. **Add row labels** for all attitude categories + Mean.
3. **Round means** to 2 decimals (optional, to match formatting).
4. **Include regression Tables 1 and 2**; otherwise the generated “analysis” is missing major parts of the true results.
