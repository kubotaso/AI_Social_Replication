Score: 82/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: names, presence, and structure

### A. **Opera is mislabeled / split incorrectly in the generated header**
- **True table (Panel 2):** has two separate columns: **“New Age/Space”** and **“Opera”**.
- **Generated header:** shows **“New Age/Space Opera”** as if it were a single genre/column, but then also includes a separate **“Bluegrass”** column immediately after—so the intent is ambiguous.

**How to fix**
- Split the generated combined label into **two columns** exactly as in the true table:
  - **New Age/Space**
  - **Opera**
- Ensure the counts under “New Age/Space” and “Opera” align with the true table (see section 2B below).

### B. **Attitude row labels mostly match, but generated uses different “No answer” coding**
- True rows include:
  - (M) Don’t know much about it
  - (M) No answer
- Generated includes the same two rows, but the **numbers do not match** in many columns (so the category exists but is miscounted).

**How to fix**
- Keep the same row set, but correct the frequency counts (next section). Also verify the data coding: the generated results look like “No answer” and “Don’t know” may be swapped/misallocated for several genres.

- (M) No answer: **46** vs **14** (+32)

**Fix:** move **32 cases** from “No answer” to “Don’t know”.
**Also fix the column name** to “New Age/Space” (not fused with Opera).

- (M) Don’t know: **82** vs **83** (−1)
- (M) No answer: **14** vs **13** (+1)

**Fix:** move **1 case** from “No answer” to “Don’t know”.

- (M) No answer: **26** vs **11** (+15)

**Fix:** move **15 cases** from “No answer” to “Don’t know”.

**Fix:** move **5 cases** from “Don’t know” to “No answer”.

#### **Gospel**
- (M) Don’t know: **40** vs **35** (+5)
- (M) No answer: **7** vs **12** (−5)

**Fix:** move **5 cases** from “Don’t know” to “No answer”.

## 3) Percentages
- The generated output shows **counts only**, not percentages.
- The prompt asks to compare “frequency counts or percentages,” but the true table also provides **counts only** (no percentages), so there’s no percentage-to-percentage mismatch to list.

**If you intended percentages:** you must compute them with a consistent denominator (likely excluding vs including missing). The mismatch pattern suggests the *missing-category denominators* may differ across outputs unless you standardize missing handling first.

---

## 4) Summary statistics (Means)
- **All means in the generated table match the true table** for every genre listed.
- This is consistent with the fact that most mismatches are **within missing categories** (“Don’t know” vs “No answer”), which typically do **not** enter mean calculations.

**No fix needed for mean values** *if* the mean is computed only on valid 1–5 responses.

---

## 5) Missing/extra column categories
- **Column naming error:** “New Age/Space Opera” should be **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.
- Otherwise, the set of 18 genres is present, but the labeling makes it look like 17 or a merged category.

**How to fix**
1. Rename/split the header into:
   - New Age/Space
   - Opera
2. Place the counts under each correct column (they already appear aligned as two separate numeric columns in the generated table, but the label is fused).

---

## 6) What’s causing the mismatches (likely) & how to correct the analysis pipeline

### Pattern diagnosis
Across many genres, the difference is almost perfectly a **transfer between “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer”**, often with equal-and-opposite differences. That strongly suggests your code is:
- misclassifying some “No answer” responses as “Don’t know”, or vice versa, depending on genre, **or**
- treating distinct missing-value codes inconsistently by variable.

### Concrete fix steps
1. **Inspect raw codes for each genre item** (GSS often uses distinct codes like DK, NA, IAP, etc.).
2. **Map missing codes consistently**:
   - “Don’t know much about it” = the specific DK/about-it code
   - “No answer” = refusal/NA/not-ascertained codes
3. **Re-tabulate per variable using identical recode rules**, then regenerate the table.

If you share the original coding scheme (e.g., numeric codes used in the dataset for DK/NA), I can give an exact recode mapping for each row category.
