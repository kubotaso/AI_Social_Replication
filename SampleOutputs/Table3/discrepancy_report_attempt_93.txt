Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: missing rows in the Generated Results

### What the **true table** has (per genre)
Each of the 18 genres has **8 rows**:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. (M) Don’t know much about it  
7. (M) No answer  
8. Mean  

### What the **generated table** has
For each genre, it shows:
- 5 numeric rows (these match rows 1–5),
- then **two rows of NaN**,
- then the Mean row.

### Mismatch
Those two NaN rows are **supposed to be the two missing “M” rows**:
- (M) Don’t know much about it  
- (M) No answer  

### Fix
Replace the two NaN rows with the correct counts from the True Results (shown below in section 2). Also label the rows correctly.

---

## 2) Frequency counts: where Generated ≠ True

### Rows (1)–(5)
All counts for **(1) Like very much** through **(5) Dislike very much** match exactly across all 18 genres.

### The missing rows (M): these are wrong (NaN vs actual counts)

The generated results have NaN for both missing-data rows for every genre, but the true table has actual nonzero counts. You need to fill in both rows as follows.

#### (M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE counts (must replace first NaN row)
- Latin/Salsa 221; Jazz 38; Blues/R&B 56; Show Tunes 77; Oldies 41; Classical/Chamber 66  
- Reggae 295; Swing/Big Band 164; New Age/Space 292; Opera 83; Bluegrass 163; Folk 78  
- Pop/Easy Listening 72; Contemporary Rock 50; Rap 61; Heavy Metal 70; Country/Western 22; Gospel 35  

#### (M) No answer — TRUE counts (must replace second NaN row)
- Latin/Salsa 12; Jazz 15; Blues/R&B 12; Show Tunes 14; Oldies 10; Classical/Chamber 11  
- Reggae 11; Swing/Big Band 12; New Age/Space 14; Opera 13; Bluegrass 11; Folk 12  
- Pop/Easy Listening 13; Contemporary Rock 12; Rap 11; Heavy Metal 10; Country/Western 10; Gospel 12  

### Percentages
The True Results table reports **counts only** (no percentages). The generated output also provides counts only (plus mean). So:
- No percentage mismatches to identify,
- but if your “generated analysis” computed percentages elsewhere, it must ensure denominators include/exclude the M categories exactly as intended (see fix guidance in section 4).

---

## 3) Summary statistics (means, totals, etc.): mismatches

### Means
The Mean row in the generated output matches the true means (to rounding) for all 18 genres:

Examples:
- Latin/Salsa: generated 3.142753 vs true 3.14 (rounding)  
- Jazz: 2.60528 vs 2.61  
- Heavy Metal: 4.122543 vs 4.12  
…all consistent.

### Totals / N
The True Results do not explicitly show a total N per genre, but totals implied by adding all 7 non-mean rows should be constant across genres.

Because the generated output **omits the two M rows**, any totals you compute from the generated table (using only rows 1–5) will be **too small** and will not match the true implied N.

(For example Latin/Salsa: rows 1–5 sum to 1373, but true adds +221 +12 = 1606.)

### Fix
If you report totals / valid-N / missingness:
- Compute totals using all 7 count rows (1–5 plus both M rows).
- Compute “valid responses” totals using only rows 1–5 **only if** you explicitly define valid as excluding the M categories.

---

## 4) Column categories / structure: mismatches

### Extra or missing columns
- The generated table includes **exactly the 18 genre columns** that appear in the True Results frequency table. Column names match (including slashes and hyphens) closely enough to be equivalent.
- No extra genre columns appear.
- No genre columns are missing.

### Structural mismatch
The true results present Table 3 as **three separate 6-column subtables**, but that’s just formatting. Your generated output merges them into one wide table, which is fine.

The *real* structural error is the **loss of the two “M” rows**, replaced by NaNs.

### Fix
Add the two missing-data rows with labels and counts. If presenting as a single wide table, keep consistent row labels across all columns:
- (1) Like very much
- (2) Like it
- (3) Mixed feelings
- (4) Dislike it
- (5) Dislike very much
- (M) Don’t know much about it
- (M) No answer
- Mean

---

## 5) One more major mismatch: you compared the wrong “tables” overall

Your “True Results” includes Tables 1 and 2 (regression coefficients), but your “Generated Results” are **only** the frequency distribution/means (Table 3-style output). So there are **entire missing outputs** in the generated results relative to the full “True Results” section:
- No replication of Table 1 (SES/Demographic/Political Intolerance models)
- No replication of Table 2 (Racism score models)

### Fix
If the goal is to match the entire “True Results” content, you must generate **three outputs**:
1) Table 1 regression coefficient table (with stars, R², Adj R², constants, N)  
2) Table 2 regression coefficient table (two dependent-variable columns)  
3) Table 3 frequency distributions (including both M rows + means)

If the goal is only Table 3, then ignore Tables 1–2—but then the “True Results” comparison set should be restricted to Table 3 only.

---

### Bottom line
- **All (1)–(5) frequencies and all means match.**
- **Every genre is missing the two “M” categories** in the generated output (shown as NaN), so any totals/percentages based on the generated table will be wrong.
- To fix: **insert the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts** and label those rows; and ensure any totals/percentages use the correct denominator definition.
