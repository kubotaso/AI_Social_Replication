Score: 74/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories: mismatches

### A. Missing rows in the Generated Results
The **Generated Results incorrectly set two “missing-data” rows to all zeros**, but in the True Results they contain nonzero counts for every genre:

- **(M) Don’t know much about it**: should have nonzero values (varies by genre)
- **(M) No answer**: should have nonzero values (varies by genre)

**Fix:** Add the correct counts for these two rows for each genre (see Section 2).

### B. Column/category structure issue: “New Age/Space Opera”
In the **Generated Results**, one column header is **“New Age/Space Opera”**, which conflates two distinct genres in the True table:

- True Panel 2 has **New Age/Space** and **Opera** as **separate columns**.

The Generated output looks like it tried to show them both but accidentally merged the header text, while the counts beneath clearly correspond to **two separate columns** (“New Age/Space” and “Opera”) placed side-by-side.

**Fix:** Split/rename headers to match the True Results:
- **New Age/Space**
- **Opera**

(And ensure the counts align under each correctly.)

### C. Number of items/columns
The True table is “18 music genres,” but it is presented as 6 + 6 + 6 columns across three panels. The Generated table includes those same 18 genres, but the **header formatting makes it look like one column combines two genres**. So the *effective* mismatch is the **incorrect column naming**, not the underlying count columns (those appear present).

**Fix:** Correct the header labeling so there are clearly 18 distinct genre columns.

## 2) Frequency-count mismatches (by row)

All “Like/Dislike” rows (1)–(5) **match exactly** across all genres.

The mismatches are entirely in the missing-data rows:

### A. (M) Don’t know much about it
Generated: **0 for every genre**  
True: **nonzero for every genre**:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

**Fix:** Replace the all-zero “Don’t know” row with these values.

### B. (M) No answer
Generated: **0 for every genre**  
True: **nonzero for every genre**:

**Panel 1**
- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**

**Panel 2**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**

**Panel 3**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

**Fix:** Replace the all-zero “No answer” row with these values.

---

## 3) Percentages
Neither table shows percentages—only counts and means. So there are **no percentage mismatches to audit**.  
**Fix (if percentages are desired):** compute them using the correct denominators (including missing categories if the table intends full distributions), and present them consistently.

---

## 4) Summary statistics mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

### A. Means
The **Mean row matches exactly** between Generated and True for all genres.

However, note an **internal consistency concern**:
- The Generated table reports means while setting missing categories to zero counts.
- In the True table, missing categories exist. Typically, means are computed **excluding missing responses**, not treating them as zero.

Even though the mean values *happen to match*, the Generated table is still **incorrect/incomplete** because it misrepresents the response distribution by deleting missingness.

**Fix:** Keep the mean values as-is (they already match), but ensure the missing rows are correctly populated so the table is coherent.

### B. Totals / N
Neither table provides totals per column, but with missing rows correctly included, each genre column should sum to the same total N (the GSS sample size for that item).

**Fix (optional but recommended):**
- Add a “Total” row per genre, or ensure downstream analysis uses:
  \[
  N = (1)+(2)+(3)+(4)+(5)+DK+NA
  \]

---

## 5) Missing or extra column categories

- **Missing category separation:** “New Age/Space” and “Opera” must be **separate** (see 1B).
- No other extra/missing genre columns are evident; the remaining genre set matches the True table.

**Fix:** Correct column headers and ensure alignment:
- Reggae
- Swing/Big Band
- New Age/Space
- Opera
- Bluegrass
- Folk
(and likewise for the other panels)

# What to change to make the Generated table match the True table
1. **Replace the all-zero (M) Don’t know much about it row** with the true counts for each genre (listed above).
2. **Replace the all-zero (M) No answer row** with the true counts for each genre (listed above).
3. **Fix the header “New Age/Space Opera”** by splitting it into two columns: **New Age/Space** and **Opera**, matching the True table’s structure (and ensure the counts under each correspond to the right genre).
4. (Optional) Add totals/percentages, but only after the missing categories are restored, using consistent denominators.
