Score: 70/100
============================================================

### 1) Row items/categories mismatched (missing rows in the generated table)

Your **generated results include only 8 rows**: the five attitude categories (1)–(5), then **two all-zero rows**, then Mean.

But the **true Table 3 has 8 substantive rows**:
1. (1) Like very much  
2. (2) Like it  
3. (3) Mixed feelings  
4. (4) Dislike it  
5. (5) Dislike very much  
6. **(M) Don’t know much about it**  ← missing in generated (replaced by zeros)  
7. **(M) No answer**  ← missing in generated (replaced by zeros)  
8. Mean  

**Mismatch:** The generated table is missing the two “M” categories and instead shows two rows of zeros.

**How to fix:** Replace the two zero rows with the correct “Don’t know much about it” and “No answer” counts from the true table (see section 2 below). Also label those rows properly.

---

### 2) Frequency count mismatches (by genre, for the missing categories)

For rows (1)–(5), your generated counts match the true table across all 18 genres.  
All mismatches are in the two missing “M” rows.

#### A) (M) Don’t know much about it — TRUE counts (should replace the first all-zero row)

- Latin/Salsa **221**
- Jazz **38**
- Blues/R&B **56**
- Show Tunes **77**
- Oldies **41**
- Classical/Chamber **66**
- Reggae **295**
- Swing/Big Band **164**
- New Age/Space **292**
- Opera **83**
- Bluegrass **163**
- Folk **78**
- Pop/Easy Listening **72**
- Contemporary Rock **50**
- Rap **61**
- Heavy Metal **70**
- Country/Western **22**
- Gospel **35**

Your generated table currently shows **0 for all of these**, which is incorrect.

#### B) (M) No answer — TRUE counts (should replace the second all-zero row)

- Latin/Salsa **12**
- Jazz **15**
- Blues/R&B **12**
- Show Tunes **14**
- Oldies **10**
- Classical/Chamber **11**
- Reggae **11**
- Swing/Big Band **12**
- New Age/Space **14**
- Opera **13**
- Bluegrass **11**
- Folk **12**
- Pop/Easy Listening **13**
- Contemporary Rock **12**
- Rap **11**
- Heavy Metal **10**
- Country/Western **10**
- Gospel **12**

Again, your generated table shows **0 across the board**, which is wrong.

**How to fix:** Populate those two rows with the values above and label them as in the true table.

---

### 3) Percentages

Neither the generated results nor the true table provides percentages—only counts and means.  
So there are **no percentage mismatches to check**.

If you intend to report percentages, you must compute them using the correct denominator (likely total cases *per genre*, i.e., sum across all 7 response categories for that genre), and then ensure they sum to 100% (subject to rounding).

---

### 4) Summary statistic mismatches (means, totals, etc.)

#### Means
The **Mean row in the generated table matches** the true means (minor formatting differences only), e.g.:
- Latin/Salsa 3.142753 vs **3.14**
- Jazz 2.60528 vs **2.61**
- Heavy Metal 4.122543 vs **4.12**

So **no mean values are wrong**.

#### Implicit totals / N per genre (not displayed but implied)
Because your generated table has the two “M” rows set to zero, the **implied total N per genre is too small** by exactly:
- “Don’t know much about it” + “No answer” for that genre.

Example:
- Latin/Salsa: missing **221 + 12 = 233** cases from the total.
- Reggae: missing **295 + 11 = 306** cases from the total.
This affects any downstream computation of totals, valid Ns, or percentages.

**How to fix:** After inserting the correct “M” rows, recompute any totals/percentages/valid Ns if you created them elsewhere.

---

### 5) Missing or extra column categories

**Columns (genre names):** The generated output includes all 18 genres and matches the true table’s genre set. No extra/missing genre columns.

**Row labels:** The generated output is missing the row labels entirely (it’s just numeric rows). In the true table, the response categories are explicitly labeled, including the two “(M)” rows.

**How to fix:**
- Add a first column (or row names) for **Attitude** with the 8 correct labels.
- Ensure the two “M” rows are included with correct counts (not zeros).

---

## Bottom line correction
Your generated table is essentially the true Table 3 **minus the two missing-data categories**, which were incorrectly output as **all zeros**. To make it match the true table:

1) Replace the two zero rows with the correct counts for:
- (M) Don’t know much about it
- (M) No answer

2) Add/restore the proper row labels.

3) Recompute any totals/percentages (if used), because current totals are understated.
