Score: 65/100
============================================================

## 1) Row items/categories mismatches

### A. Missing attitude rows in the **Generated Results**
Your generated table includes these rows:

- (1) Like very much  
- (2) Like it  
- (3) Mixed feelings  
- (4) Dislike it  
- (5) Dislike very much  
- (M) Don’t know much about it **(present but all zeros)**  
- (M) No answer **(present but all zeros)**  
- Mean  

The **True Results** include the same rows, but **the two “(M)” rows are not zero**—they contain substantial counts for every genre.

**Fix:** Populate the “(M) Don’t know much about it” and “(M) No answer” rows with the true counts (listed below in section 2). Don’t leave them as zero.

### B. Column/category naming mismatch: “New Age/Space Opera”
In the Generated Results, one column header is:

- **“New Age/Space Opera”**

In the True Results, this is actually **two separate columns**:

- **“New Age/Space”**
- **“Opera”**

So the generated table has **one combined genre column** where the true table has **two distinct genres**.

**Fix:** Split the generated “New Age/Space Opera” column into **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”, each with its own frequency distribution and mean (see True Panel 2).

---

## 2) Frequency count mismatches (by row/genre)

### The big issue: all “M” counts are incorrectly zero in Generated Results
In the Generated Results, for **every genre**, both of these rows are shown as 0:

- (M) Don’t know much about it  
- (M) No answer  

But the True Results show non-zero values for both rows for every genre.

#### Correct values that must replace the zeros

### Panel 1 (Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Latin/Salsa: **221**
- Jazz: **38**
- Blues/R&B: **56**
- Show Tunes: **77**
- Oldies: **41**
- Classical/Chamber: **66**

**(M) No answer**
- Latin/Salsa: **12**
- Jazz: **15**
- Blues/R&B: **12**
- Show Tunes: **14**
- Oldies: **10**
- Classical/Chamber: **11**

### Panel 2 (Reggae, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Reggae: **295**
- Swing/Big Band: **164**
- New Age/Space: **292**
- Opera: **83**
- Bluegrass: **163**
- Folk: **78**

**(M) No answer**
- Reggae: **11**
- Swing/Big Band: **12**
- New Age/Space: **14**
- Opera: **13**
- Bluegrass: **11**
- Folk: **12**

### Panel 3 (Pop/Easy Listening, Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel)
**(M) Don’t know much about it**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **72**
- Contemporary Rock: **50**
- Rap: **61**
- Heavy Metal: **70**
- Country/Western: **22**
- Gospel: **35**

**(M) No answer**
- Pop/Easy Listening: **13**
- Contemporary Rock: **12**
- Rap: **11**
- Heavy Metal: **10**
- Country/Western: **10**
- Gospel: **12**

### All other frequency rows (1–5) match
For the (1)–(5) categories, the generated counts match the true counts **for every genre shown**, *except* for the structural column issue where “New Age/Space” and “Opera” are incorrectly merged into one column header (but the counts displayed under that merged header appear to be showing both columns’ values separately in adjacent positions—i.e., the data are there, the label is wrong / merged).

---

## 3) Summary statistics (means) mismatches

### Means shown match the True Results (values)
All mean values in the Generated Results match the True Results **numerically** for the corresponding genres.

### But the means are conceptually inconsistent with the generated “M=0” rows
If you truly had 0 “Don’t know” and 0 “No answer” for every genre, the computed means (if calculated on the remaining cases) would generally not match the published means that come from the true distributions with missing categories present. In other words:

- **The means happen to match only because they were copied**, not because they were computed from the generated frequency table (which currently has incorrect missing rows).

**Fix:** After inserting the correct “M” counts, recompute (or at least validate) the means using the same rule as the source table (typically: mean over valid responses 1–5, excluding M categories). With the correct M rows restored, the published means should align.

---

## 4) Missing or extra column categories

### Missing separate “Opera” column (structural error)
As noted, **Opera** must be its own column; it is not part of “New Age/Space”.

**Fix:** Use these exact columns for Panel 2:
- Reggae
- Swing/Big Band
- New Age/Space
- **Opera**
- Bluegrass
- Folk

And rename “New Age/Space Opera” → “New Age/Space” plus add “Opera”.

---

## 5) Percentages
Neither table displays percentages—only counts and means. So there are **no percentage mismatches to audit** here.

---

# Minimal change list to make Generated match True

1. Replace the all-zero “(M) Don’t know much about it” row with the correct non-zero counts for each genre.
2. Replace the all-zero “(M) No answer” row with the correct non-zero counts for each genre.
3. Split the merged/incorrect header **“New Age/Space Opera”** into **two columns**: “New Age/Space” and “Opera”.
4. After (1)–(3), ensure the means are computed/validated using the same missing-data handling as the true table (exclude M categories from mean).
