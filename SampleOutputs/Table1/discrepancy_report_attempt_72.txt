## 1) Fit statistics: n, R², adjusted R²

### Mismatches
- **Sample sizes (n) are wrong in all generated models**
  - Generated: **M1 n=747**, **M2 n=507**, **M3 n=286**
  - True: **M1 n=787**, **M2 n=756**, **M3 n=503**
- **R² and adjusted R² are wrong in all generated models**
  - Model 1: Generated **R²=.088** / **adj=.085** vs True **R²=.107** / **adj=.104**
  - Model 2: Generated **R²=.135** / **adj=.118** vs True **R²=.151** / **adj=.139**
  - Model 3: Generated **R²=.145** / **adj=.111** vs True **R²=.169** / **adj=.148**

### How to fix
- **Use the same analytic sample definition as the paper for each model.** Your sample is collapsing dramatically once you add demographics and then political intolerance, which indicates listwise deletion on variables that *should not* be causing that much attrition (or you are using different missing-value codes).
- Specifically:
  1. Recode all GSS missing codes (e.g., “Don’t know,” “No answer,” “Not applicable”) to `NA` **exactly as the paper did**.
  2. Ensure Model 2 is not inadvertently requiring non-missing **political intolerance** (or any Model 3-only variable). Model 2 should be fit on ~756 cases, not 507.
  3. Ensure Model 3 uses the political intolerance variable but *does not additionally drop cases due to miscoding of race dummies*, etc.; it should be ~503, not 286.
  4. After harmonizing, recompute R²/adj R²; they will move toward the reported values.

## 2) Variable names and coding (including “Other race”)

### Mismatches
- **Race variables are inconsistent and “Other race” is effectively dropped**
  - Generated output shows **“Other race = NaN”** and `dropped_predictors = otherrace` in Models 2–3.
  - True table includes **Other race** with nonzero β in Models 2–3 (**0.005** and **0.053**).

- **Your sample profile shows “hispanic” coded incorrectly**
  - Generated Model 2 profile: `hispanic mean = 0.917` (and Model 3: 0.920).
  - That implies ~92% of the sample is coded Hispanic=1, which is not plausible for GSS 1993 and contradicts having separate black/hispanic/otherrace indicators.
  - This strongly suggests **you coded “hispanic” as “not Hispanic” (or reversed)**, or you used a wrong source variable.

### How to fix
- Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies from the correct underlying GSS variables and verify:
  - `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` must vary (not all 0, not constant).
  - Use a clear reference group (likely **White, non-Hispanic**), and ensure the dummies are mutually consistent.
- Fix “Other race” dropping:
  - It is dropping because it has **zero variance** in your estimation sample (`otherrace mean = 0.000, sd = 0.000`), meaning you filtered it away or miscoded it.
  - Ensure your race construction actually assigns some respondents to “other race” and you haven’t filtered them out earlier (e.g., by only keeping white/black respondents).

## 3) Coefficients: standardized betas vs unstandardized b

### Mismatches (core conceptual error)
- The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constants**.
- Your “table1style” mixes:
  - standardized betas (for predictors) — OK in intent
  - but your **betas do not match** the true betas
  - and your constants do not match either
- Additionally, your “full” models report **unstandardized b**, **standardized beta**, and **p-values**—but the true table does **not** report SEs or p-values, only stars.

### How to fix
- Decide what you are trying to match:
  - If matching **Table 1**, you must output **standardized β only** (plus constant unstandardized), and apply stars using the paper’s thresholds.
- To match β exactly:
  - Fit OLS on the correct sample and coding.
  - Compute standardized betas *the same way the authors did* (typically: standardize variables then regress; or compute from unstandardized b using SD ratios). Small deviations can also come from weighting and missing-data handling.
  - Check whether the paper used **weights**; if yes, apply them.

## 4) Term-by-term coefficient mismatches (β)

Below I compare your **generated Table1 betas** to the **true betas**.

### Model 1 (SES)
- Education: Generated **-0.292*** vs True **-0.322*** (too small in magnitude)
- Income: Generated **-0.039** vs True **-0.037** (close)
- Prestige: Generated **0.020** vs True **0.016** (slightly high)
- Constant: Generated **10.638** vs True **10.920** (too low)
- R²: Generated **.088** vs True **.107** (too low)
- n: Generated **747** vs True **787** (too low)

**Fix:** correct sample selection + standardization procedure; then refit.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- Education: Generated **-0.264*** vs True **-0.246*** (too negative)
- Income: Generated **-0.053** vs True **-0.054** (close)
- Prestige: Generated **-0.016** vs True **-0.006** (too negative)
- Female: Generated **-0.090***? (shown as -0.090*) vs True **-0.083*** (slightly more negative)
- Age: Generated **0.104***? (0.104*) vs True **0.140*** (substantially too small; also wrong stars)
- Black: Generated **0.043** vs True **0.029** (different)
- Hispanic: Generated **0.030** vs True **-0.029** (**sign is wrong**)
- Other race: Generated **blank/dropped** vs True **0.005** (**missing entirely**)
- Conservative Protestant: Generated **0.090** (no star; p≈.053 in full model) vs True **0.059** (no star in true table)
- No religion: Generated **-0.019** vs True **-0.012**
- Southern: Generated **0.063** vs True **0.097** (**and your stars differ: none vs ** in true**)
- Constant: Generated **9.285** vs True **8.507** (too high)
- R²: Generated **.135** vs True **.151**
- n: Generated **507** vs True **756** (massively too low)

**Fixes:**
1. **Race coding** (especially Hispanic) must be corrected (your sign flip is a red flag).
2. **Other race** must be present (not dropped).
3. **Sample definition** must match (biggest issue).
4. Recompute β and significance after the above; Age and Southern are currently far from the paper, consistent with sample/coding differences.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- Education: Generated **-0.157***? (-0.157*) vs True **-0.151**** (very close; stars differ)
- Income: Generated **-0.050** vs True **-0.009** (**way off**)
- Prestige: Generated **-0.011** vs True **-0.022** (different)
- Female: Generated **-0.122***? (-0.122*) vs True **-0.095*** (too negative)
- Age: Generated **0.083 (ns)** vs True **0.110*** (**too small; wrong inference**)
- Black: Generated **0.107** vs True **0.049** (different)
- Hispanic: Generated **0.028** vs True **0.031** (close)
- Other race: Generated **blank/dropped** vs True **0.053** (**missing entirely**)
- Conservative Protestant: Generated **0.037** vs True **0.066** (different)
- No religion: Generated **0.024** vs True **0.024** (matches)
- Southern: Generated **0.065** vs True **0.121** (**too small; wrong inference**)
- Political intolerance: Generated **0.190** (β) with ** (p=.00265) vs True **0.164*** (β) (**magnitude and stars differ**)
- Constant: Generated **7.360** vs True **6.516** (too high)
- R²: Generated **.145** vs True **.169**
- n: Generated **286** vs True **503** (far too low)

**Fixes:**
1. Correct the **Model 3 sample** (should be 503).
2. Fix **otherrace** not being dropped.
3. Verify **income scaling**: your β for income in Model 3 is hugely more negative than the true (-0.050 vs -0.009). That can happen if:
   - income was transformed differently (e.g., logged vs raw),
   - you used a different income-per-capita construction,
   - or standardization used the wrong SD due to wrong sample/weights.
4. Once sample/coding aligns, refit and regenerate β and stars.

## 5) Standard errors and p-values: not comparable to the “true” table

### Mismatches
- Your generated “full” models present **p-values and implied SEs**, but the true results explicitly state **SEs are not reported** in Table 1.
- Therefore any claim like “Black p=.87” is **not something you can validate against Table 1**.

### How to fix
- If your goal is to match Table 1:
  - **Do not present SEs/p-values as if they were extracted from the table.**
  - Only present standardized β, constants, R², adj R², n, and stars.
- If your goal is to replicate the underlying regression rather than the table:
  - Then you need the authors’ SEs/DF/weighting/robustness choices—otherwise your SEs won’t be “wrong,” they’ll be **non-comparable**.

## 6) Interpretation mismatches implied by your output

### Mismatches
- **Hispanic effect sign (Model 2)**: Generated positive (0.030) but true is negative (-0.029). Any narrative about Hispanics disliking *more* genres would contradict the paper.
- **Age (Models 2–3)**: You would conclude weaker/NS effects (especially Model 3) whereas the true table indicates **positive and significant** age effects.
- **Southern (Models 2–3)**: You would likely conclude weak/NS, but the true table reports **Southern is significant and substantively larger**.

### How to fix
- Do not interpret until:
  1. race coding is corrected,
  2. “Other race” is included,
  3. samples match the reported n,
  4. betas are recomputed to match the paper’s standardization/weights.

---

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match the true table
1. **Recreate the three model samples to hit n=787, 756, 503** (this is the largest discrepancy).
2. **Fix Hispanic and Other race coding** (Hispanic currently looks reversed; Other race is constant 0 and dropped).
3. **Confirm income-per-capita construction and scaling** matches the paper (especially Model 3 where β is very off).
4. **Apply the same weighting and standardization method** used in the paper.
5. Regenerate “Table1-style” output as: **standardized β for predictors**, **unstandardized constant**, **R²/adj R²**, **n**, and stars using the paper’s thresholds.
