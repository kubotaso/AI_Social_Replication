============================================================

## A) Table structure / labeling discrepancies

1) **Standard errors shown in the Generated table but “True” table has none**
- **Mismatch:** Your *Generated Results* table prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like a **standard error** (e.g., educ: `-0.332***` then `-0.034`). But the *True Results* explicitly state the PDF table reports **standardized coefficients only and does not print SEs**.
- **Fix:** Remove the SE rows entirely from the presentation to match the PDF. If you must show SEs, you need to (a) compute them from the underlying data and (b) clearly label the table as “computed SEs (not in PDF)”—but that will no longer “match the printed table.”

2) **Model names vs. model content**
- **Mismatch:** Your “Model 3 (Political intolerance)” matches the concept, but the estimates clearly come from a *different estimation sample/model specification than the PDF*, as shown by N, constants, and multiple coefficient differences (details below).
- **Fix:** Align the *exact sample restrictions/coding* used in the PDF (see Section D).

---

## B) Variable name mismatches

The variable *labels* in your long coefficient table differ from the PDF’s labels, but most are interpretable equivalents:

- `educ` ↔ **Education** (OK)
- `income_pc` ↔ **Household income per capita** (OK if constructed identically; see Section D)
- `prestg80` ↔ **Occupational prestige** (OK)
- `female` ↔ **Female** (OK)
- `black` ↔ **Black** (OK)
- `hispanic` ↔ **Hispanic** (OK, but your coding rule is suspicious; see D3)
- `other_race` ↔ **Other race** (OK)
- `conservative_protestant` ↔ **Conservative Protestant** (OK if matches PDF definition; you have missingness here, which is a warning sign)
- `no_religion` ↔ **No religion** (OK if matches PDF definition; also has missingness)
- `southern` ↔ **Southern** (OK)
- `political_intolerance` ↔ **Political intolerance** (OK in name, but construction differs; see D4)

**Main issue is not the names—it’s that the coding/sample used to produce these variables does not replicate the PDF.**

## C) Coefficient (standardized beta) mismatches — by model and variable

Below I list *Generated beta* vs *True beta* (PDF), and what’s wrong.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.332*** | **-0.322*** | magnitude too negative (Δ=-0.010) |
| Income per cap | -0.034 | -0.037 | small difference (Δ=+0.003) |
| Prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | noticeably higher (Δ=+0.013) |
| Constant | 11.086 | 10.920 | higher (Δ=+0.166) |
| R² | 0.1088 | 0.107 | slightly higher |
| Adj R² | 0.1052 | 0.104 | slightly higher |
| **N** | **758** | **787** | **wrong N** (−29) |

**Interpretation problem:** Because N differs, you are not using the same estimation sample; therefore standardized betas will not match.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.302*** | **-0.246*** | **major mismatch** (too negative by 0.056) |
| Income per cap | -0.057 | -0.054 | close |
| Prestige | -0.007 | -0.006 | close |
| Female | -0.078 (ns) | **-0.083*** | sign/magnitude close, but **significance differs** |
| Age | **0.109*** | **0.140*** | **too small** |
| Black | 0.053 | 0.029 | too large |
| Hispanic | -0.017 | -0.029 | too small in magnitude |
| Other race | **-0.016** | **0.005** | **sign mismatch** |
| Cons Prot | 0.040 | 0.059 | too small |
| No religion | -0.016 | -0.012 | close |
| Southern | **0.079** (ns) | **0.097**** | too small + significance differs |
| Constant | **10.089** | **8.507** | **very large mismatch** |
| R² | 0.157 | 0.151 | somewhat higher |
| Adj R² | 0.139 | 0.139 | matches by coincidence |
| **N** | **523** | **756** | **catastrophically wrong N** |

This is not a “rounding” problem: your Model 2 is estimated on a much smaller and different subset (523 vs 756), which will change betas, constants, and significance.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157* | **-0.151**** | very close magnitude but **stars differ** (** vs *) |
| Income per cap | **-0.067** | **-0.009** | **major mismatch** |
| Prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | mismatch |
| Female | **-0.118*** | **-0.095*** | too negative |
| Age | 0.092 (ns) | **0.110*** | too small, significance differs |
| Black | 0.004 | 0.049 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.091 | 0.031 | mismatch |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| Cons Prot | -0.011 | 0.066 | sign mismatch |
| No religion | 0.018 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | **0.073** (ns) | **0.121**** | much too small + significance differs |
| Political intolerance | **0.196**** | **0.164*** | too large + stars differ (** vs ***) |
| Constant | **7.583** | **6.516** | too high |
| R² | **0.152** | **0.169** | too low |
| Adj R² | **0.115** | **0.148** | too low |
| **N** | **293** | **503** | **wrong N** (−210) |

Again: large N mismatch implies you are not replicating the PDF sample and/or the intolerance scale construction.

## D) Why you don’t match the PDF (and how to fix it)

### D1) **Wrong estimation samples (biggest source of mismatch)**
Your Ns are: 758, 523, 293. True Ns are: 787, 756, 503.

Your own diagnostics say you are using:
- DV complete-case across **all 18 music items**
- Political intolerance requires complete on **all 15 items**
This is a very strict listwise deletion rule, which collapses N drastically—especially in Models 2 and 3.

**Fix: replicate the PDF’s missing-data rule.** Likely options (you must confirm from the PDF methods/appendix/codebook):
- DV “# genres disliked” may be computed with **allowable item nonresponse** (e.g., sum over answered items, or require fewer than 18).
- Political intolerance scale may be computed if respondents answered **a minimum number** of items (not all 15), or with mean-imputation across answered items, or using a different skip pattern.
- Model Ns strongly suggest the authors did **not** require complete data on all items.

Concrete implementation fixes:
- Recreate DV exactly as authors: e.g., `rowSums(dislike_items == 4|5, na.rm=TRUE)` and then possibly standardize by number answered (if that’s what they did).
- For intolerance: use the same inclusion rule (e.g., “at least k items nonmissing”), and compute scale as sum/mean accordingly.

### D2) **Standardization procedure may differ from the PDF**
You state: “standardized betas computed as b * SD(x)/SD(y) on each model’s estimation sample.” That’s typical, but the PDF may have:
- standardized all variables using a common reference sample, or
- standardized after constructing scales differently, or
- used listwise deletion differently before standardizing.

**Fix:** Standardize exactly as the authors did:
- If they standardized variables (z-scores) first and then ran OLS, do that.
- Ensure the SDs used come from the same sample the authors used (which again points back to fixing missingness).

### D3) **Hispanic coding rule looks wrong / inconsistent with your missingness**
Your rule says: “ETHNIC==1 => 1; other nonmissing => 0; ETHNIC missing => NA”
But your missingness table shows **hispanic has 281 missing**, which is huge and is directly shrinking Model 2 and 3 N.

In many survey codings, “Hispanic” is often coded via:
- a separate ethnicity question with valid nonresponse codes (e.g., 8/9), or
- derived from race/ethnicity combined variables where “non-Hispanic” is explicitly coded (so missing should be rare).

**Fix:**
- Recode “don’t know/refused/inapplicable” to NA properly, but treat explicit “non-Hispanic” as 0.
- If the original variable uses special codes, you must map them correctly (e.g., 8, 9, 0).
- If the PDF used a combined race/ethnicity variable, use that rather than a partially missing ETHNIC item.

### D4) **Political intolerance scale construction likely differs**
You used: “sum of 15 intolerance indicators; require complete on all 15 items.”
Your own summary shows many nonmissing (491), but your Model 3 N is 293 due to intersection with other covariates + strict DV rule.

Also, your generated coefficient for income changes massively in Model 3 vs True (-0.067 vs -0.009), which often happens when:
- the intolerance scale is mis-scored (direction reversed or different item set),
- the sample is highly selected, or
- key controls are miscoded.

**Fix:**
- Verify item direction (higher = more intolerance?) and ensure all items are coded consistently before summing.
- Confirm it is **15 items** in the PDF (not fewer/more, not a factor score, not an average).
- Match the inclusion rule for scale (often “if answered ≥ X items”).
- After rebuilding, verify descriptive stats against the paper (mean, min/max). Your max is 15, mean ~9.77; if the paper reports different moments, your construction is off.

### D5) **Religion variables have missing values (3 each) — suggests coding problems**
`conservative_protestant` and `no_religion` show missingness=3. In many analyses these are fully constructed from denomination variables and should be nonmissing once defined (unless authors intentionally left some undefined).

**Fix:** Rebuild religion categories using the same denominational classification as the paper, and ensure every respondent is assigned to exactly one category (or a clearly defined missing category that matches the authors’ exclusions).

---

## E) Significance-star / interpretation mismatches

Even where coefficients are “close,” your significance often differs (e.g., Female in Model 2, Southern in Models 2–3, Education in Model 3, Political intolerance in Model 3).

Reasons:
- different N and residual variance due to sample selection,
- you’re attaching stars from **unstandardized OLS p-values**, while the PDF’s stars correspond to the PDF’s estimation (and possibly to standardized regression if they ran z-scored variables directly—though p-values are typically identical either way if it’s a linear rescale, but sample differences dominate here).

**Fix:**
1) First replicate sample and variable construction → coefficients should line up.
2) Then compute p-values the same way (OLS with same covariates, same exclusions, same weights if any).
3) Finally apply the same star cutoffs (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001), which you already list—but you must be using the same p-values as the paper.

---

## F) What you should change so the Generated analysis matches the True table

Priority order:

1) **Replicate the authors’ sample sizes (N=787, 756, 503).**  
   This will require loosening your “complete-case across 18 music items” and “complete on all 15 intolerance items” rules to match the PDF’s actual approach.

2) **Reconstruct DV “Number of music genres disliked” exactly as in the paper.**  
   Your strict DV rule is the single biggest driver of shrinking N.

3) **Recode Hispanic and religion variables to eliminate artificial missingness** (and match the paper’s operationalization).

4) **Rebuild political intolerance scale** to match item set, direction, and inclusion rule used in the PDF.

5) **Only then** re-run models and present **standardized betas only**, with the **PDF’s R²/Adj R²/N and constants**.  
   Do not print SEs if you are claiming to reproduce the printed Table 1.

If you share (a) the exact PDF wording about scale construction/missing data, or (b) the codebook variable names/codes for ETHNIC, religion, the 18 music items, and the intolerance items, I can tell you exactly which recodes/inclusion rules would recover the target Ns and bring each coefficient into alignment.
