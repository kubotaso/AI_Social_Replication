## 1) Table/term naming mismatches

### A. Variable labels don’t match Table 1 wording (minor but should be fixed)
**Generated term names**: `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `other_race`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`  
**True Table 1 names**: Education; Household income per capita; Occupational prestige; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Other race; Southern; Political intolerance.

**Fix**
- Keep internal names if you want, but **print Table 1 labels exactly** as in the PDF (or add a label mapping in the table builder).
- Example mapping:  
  - `educ` → “Education”  
  - `income_pc` → “Household income per capita”  
  - `prestg80` → “Occupational prestige”  
  - `conservative_protestant` → “Conservative Protestant”  
  - etc.

### B. “Standard errors” are shown/implied in the generated table, but the true table has none
Your **Generated Results** table visually shows a second line under each coefficient that looks like an SE row (e.g., educ in Model 1 shows “-0.332***” and then “-0.034”). But the **True Results explicitly say Table 1 prints standardized coefficients only and no SEs**.

**Fix**
- Remove SE rows entirely from the printed table (or if you truly computed SEs yourself, you must clearly label them as *computed from your replication*, not “as printed”).
- If the goal is to match Table 1 **as printed**, show **only standardized betas and stars**, no SEs.

## 3) Standard errors: not just mismatched—conceptually incorrect relative to “true”

You were asked to check SE mismatches, but the **true table does not report SEs at all**. So any “SE comparison” is impossible against Table 1.

**Fix options (choose one, but be explicit):**
1. **To match the PDF Table 1**: do **not** display SEs anywhere in the “Table 1 replication”.
2. **If you want to add SEs**: compute them from your microdata replication, but then you must label the table “Replication with computed SEs (not in published Table 1)”. You still must match the published standardized betas, R², N, etc., if claiming replication.

---

## 4) Interpretation/significance (stars) mismatches

Even where coefficients are “close”, **stars frequently don’t match**:
- Model 2: `female` should be * but you show none.
- Model 2: `age` should be *** but you show *.
- Model 2: `southern` should be ** but you show none.
- Model 3: `educ` should be ** but you show *.
- Model 3: `age` should be * but you show none.
- Model 3: `southern` should be ** but you show none.
- Model 3: `political_intolerance` should be *** but you show **.

**Fix**
- Stars must be based on the same p-values the authors used. In your diagnostics you say: “stars from raw OLS p-values; Table shows standardized betas only.”
  - That’s *fine* only if your model specification + sample + weighting/robust-SE choices exactly match the authors’.
- Practically, star mismatches almost always come from:
  1) wrong **N/sample restriction** (you have that problem severely),  
  2) wrong **weights** (GSS analyses often use weights),  
  3) wrong **SE estimator** (authors may use conventional OLS SEs; you might be using robust, or vice versa),  
  4) different **coding of variables** / reference categories,  
  5) different **standardization procedure** (see next section).

## 5) The biggest cause: your estimation samples (N) do not match the published N

Published N: **787 / 756 / 503**  
Generated N: **758 / 523 / 293**

These are not small differences; they will change coefficients, constants, R², and stars.

### What your diagnostics imply
- You start with 893 with complete DV.
- Then you do listwise deletion:
  - Model 1 drops to 758 (loss 135)
  - Model 2 drops to 523 (loss 370)
  - Model 3 drops to 293 (loss 600)

That is far more missingness than the published table suggests (since the published Ns are much larger than yours).

**Fix**
To match Table 1, you must replicate the **author’s sample definition and missing-data handling**. Concretely:
1) **Use the same base year/sample** (you mention `N_year_1993=1606`; make sure the paper’s Table 1 is indeed restricted to 1993 and to the same subsample rules).
2) **Reproduce the authors’ handling of missing covariates**, especially `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`:
   - Your `hispanic` variable has **281 missing out of 893**, which is enormous and is a major reason Model 2 collapses to N=523.
   - In many datasets, “Hispanic” is constructed from race/ethnicity questions where “not asked”, “don’t know”, or “other” need recoding to 0/1 rather than NA, *or* authors sometimes restrict to respondents asked the ethnicity module.
3) **Political intolerance**: you drop to N=293 because `political_intolerance` has 402 missing among the 893 DV-complete cases.
   - The paper’s N=503 suggests they either (a) have fewer missings in their constructed intolerance index than you do, or (b) used a different construction rule (e.g., allow partial completion and compute an average/scale if enough items are answered, rather than “strict complete-case on 15 items” as you wrote).

**Immediate actionable change suggested by your own note**
- You explicitly state: “political intolerance is strict complete-case on 15 items.”
- That almost certainly does **not** match the authors’ scale construction.

So:
- Rebuild `political_intolerance` using the same rule as the paper (common options: sum of nonmissing items; mean if ≥k items present; impute missing items; or use IRT/scale score).
- Then rerun Model 3 and check if N moves toward **503**.

## 6) Standardization procedure likely differs

You are reporting `beta_std` and calling them “standardized betas.” Published betas depend on *how* variables were standardized and *what sample* was used to compute SDs.

Common mismatch sources:
- Standardizing on the **analysis sample** vs standardizing on a larger base sample.
- Standardizing **before** vs **after** applying weights.
- Standardizing binary variables (0/1) is fine, but if your coding differs (e.g., female coded 1/2), standardized betas change.

**Fix**
- Verify the paper’s definition: are these fully standardized coefficients (Y and X standardized), or only X standardized?
- Implement exactly:
  - If “standardized OLS coefficients”: usually means **both DV and predictors standardized** in the estimation sample (or equivalently transform coefficients by SD ratio).
- Use the **same sample used in each model** to compute SDs (unless the authors specify otherwise).

---

## 7) Constants: consistently too large in your results

Your constants are higher in every model (11.086 vs 10.920; 10.089 vs 8.507; 7.583 vs 6.516).

Even if coefficients were standardized, constants depend on whether:
- you estimated the model on raw variables but reported standardized betas separately, or
- you standardized variables and then ran OLS (in which case intercept should be ~0 if all variables including DV are standardized).

The published table includes nonzero constants, implying: **they likely ran OLS on the original DV** and are reporting standardized betas computed from that model (or computed post hoc), not a regression on fully standardized DV.

**Fix**
- Replicate their workflow:
  1) Run OLS on the **original DV scale**.
  2) Compute standardized coefficients as:  
     \(\beta^{std}_j = b_j \times \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}\)  
     using the appropriate SDs (and weights, if used).
  3) Print the original intercept from the unstandardized regression.

## 8) What to change so the generated analysis matches the true Table 1

Priority order:

1) **Match Ns exactly** (787 / 756 / 503)
   - Fix Hispanic missing coding (don’t leave huge NA unless authors did).
   - Reconstruct political intolerance index using the authors’ missing-data rule (not strict complete-case on 15 items unless confirmed).
   - Ensure you’re using the same year/subsample restrictions.

2) **Match variable coding/reference categories**
   - Race dummies: confirm which category is the reference (likely White non-Hispanic).
   - Religion: confirm reference group (probably not Conservative Protestant and not No religion; ensure dummies match paper).

3) **Match weighting and SE conventions**
   - If the paper uses weights, apply the same weight variable.
   - Use the same p-value computation that drives stars (OLS classic SE vs robust; design-based SE if survey).

4) **Match standardized coefficient computation**
   - Compute standardized betas the same way the authors did (post-estimation conversion is most consistent with a nonzero constant).

If you want, paste the code you used to (a) create `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) define the analysis sample, and I can pinpoint exactly why your N collapses and which recodes will move you to the published Ns and betas.
