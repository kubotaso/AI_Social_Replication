Score: 10/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: **all mismatched (and internally inconsistent)**

**Generated**
- `n = 0`, `r2 = NaN`, `adj_r2 = NaN` for all models.
- “dropped” lists *every* substantive predictor as dropped.
- Missingness table claims **100% missing** for `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, which makes it impossible to estimate the models (hence the NaNs).

**True**
- Model 1: **n = 787**, **R² = 0.107**, **Adj R² = 0.104**
- Model 2: **n = 756**, **R² = 0.151**, **Adj R² = 0.139**
- Model 3: **n = 503**, **R² = 0.169**, **Adj R² = 0.148**

**How to fix**
- Your analysis pipeline is using the **wrong variable names** (or wrong dataset year/subset), producing all-missing predictors and therefore a model with **0 complete cases**.
- Fix by:
  1. Verifying the GSS 1993 data extract actually contains the intended variables.
  2. Renaming/recode mapping so the predictors are not all `NA`.
  3. Recomputing models after creating a consistent complete-case sample (or using an explicit missing-data strategy).

### 2) Coefficients: **every coefficient is missing vs. the true non-missing βs**

**Generated**
- For Models 1–3, all `b`, `beta`, `p` are `NaN`.

**True (Table 1 reports standardized coefficients β; constants unstandardized)**
Model 1:
- Education **β = -0.322***  
- Income pc **β = -0.037**  
- Prestige **β = 0.016**  
- Constant **= 10.920**

Model 2:
- Education **β = -0.246***, Female **β = -0.083***? (actually *), Age **β = 0.140***, South **β = 0.097** (**) … etc.
- Constant **= 8.507**

Model 3:
- Political intolerance **β = 0.164***, Education **β = -0.151** (**) … etc.
- Constant **= 6.516**

**How to fix**
- First fix the missingness/variable-name problem (otherwise you can’t estimate anything).
- Then ensure you are outputting the **same estimand** as the paper:
  - Table 1 uses **standardized OLS coefficients (β)**, not unstandardized `b`.
  - Many packages default to unstandardized coefficients. You must either:
    - standardize all variables (except the intercept) before OLS, or
    - compute standardized betas from the fitted model.

### 3) Standard errors and p-values: **mismatched reporting standard**

**Generated**
- Reports `p` (but they are NaN). Also seems prepared to show SEs (even if not displayed in the model tables).

**True**
- Table 1 **does not report standard errors** at all—only significance stars.
- The “Std. Error” column in the provided “True Results” is correctly “— (not reported)”.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to “match Table 1,” your generated output should:
  - **omit SEs** (or fill with “—”) and
  - show **β with stars** only, matching the paper’s thresholds.
- If you do compute p-values from the data, they may not match the paper exactly due to weighting, sample restrictions, and variable coding; but you still shouldn’t claim they are “Table 1” unless you replicate the exact design.

---

### 4) Variable-name mismatches / coding mismatches (root cause of NaNs)

**Generated variable names (in missingness and dropped lists)**
- `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, `age_v`, `pol_intol`, outcome `num_genres_disliked`, plus `female`, `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south`.

**True table variable labels**
- Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Political intolerance; outcome: Number of Music Genres Disliked.

**What’s wrong**
- The generated names may be your constructed variables, but the missingness table shows that **key SES vars are entirely missing**:
  - `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v` are 0 nonmissing (100% missing).
- `age_v` is ~99% missing, which is implausible for GSS unless you mis-merged or recoded.

**How to fix**
- Audit your data dictionary and transformations:
  - Confirm the *raw* columns used to create `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, `age_v` actually exist and are numeric.
  - Common GSS pitfalls: special missing codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) not converted to NA correctly, or conversion that accidentally turned everything into NA.
  - Confirm year filter is correct (1993) and that you didn’t subset to a wave where these variables are absent.
- After fixing: rerun missingness; you should get nonmissing counts that allow **n=787/756/503** (or extremely close if you’re not matching the paper’s listwise deletion rules exactly).

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches: standardized vs unstandardized + sign patterns

**Generated**
- No substantive interpretation is possible because everything is NaN; but the table structure implies it might interpret `b` and `beta` interchangeably.

**True**
- The paper’s substantive interpretation rests on **standardized betas (β)**:
  - Education is strongly negative across models (largest magnitude in Model 1, attenuates with controls).
  - Political intolerance is positive and significant in Model 3.
  - Age is positive; Female negative; South positive.

**How to fix**
- Ensure your narrative and tables explicitly state:
  - “Coefficients are standardized (β); intercept is unstandardized.”
- When generating interpretation, use the standardized scale (“a 1 SD increase in X is associated with β SD change in Y”), not raw-unit interpretation.

---

### 6) Model sample sizes: generated pipeline must replicate the paper’s **listwise deletion per model**

**Generated**
- Implicitly uses complete cases (ends up with 0).

**True**
- n decreases across models (787 → 756 → 503), consistent with:
  - additional covariates with missingness (especially political intolerance).

**How to fix**
- Implement **model-specific listwise deletion** consistent with the paper:
  - Model 1 complete cases on SES vars + outcome.
  - Model 2 complete cases on SES + demographics + outcome.
  - Model 3 complete cases on SES + demographics + political intolerance + outcome.
- Do *not* reuse a single “complete-case for all variables” dataset for all models unless that is what the paper did (their ns suggest it did not).

## Minimal set of changes to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Fix variable construction** so `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, `age_v` are not all missing (correct source variables + missing-code handling).
2. **Refit three OLS models** with model-specific complete cases so n matches (≈787/756/503).
3. **Report standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constants**, matching Table 1.
4. **Remove/blank SEs** (or label “not reported”) and show only significance stars with the same thresholds.
5. Ensure coding of indicators (Female, race categories, religion, South) matches the paper’s reference categories; otherwise signs/magnitudes won’t match even after the NaN issue is fixed.

If you share the code used to create `educ_yrs/inc_pc/prestg80_v/age_v/pol_intol` (or the raw column names), I can pinpoint exactly where the all-missing conversion occurs and what recode to apply.
