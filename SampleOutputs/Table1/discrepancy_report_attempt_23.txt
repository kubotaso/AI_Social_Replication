Score: 10/100
============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, plus what you must change so the generated analysis can match the paper’s table.

---

## 1) Core conceptual mismatch: you reported the wrong kind of coefficients

### What the true table reports
- The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized OLS coefficients (β)** for predictors.
- The **constant is unstandardized**.
- **Standard errors are not reported** (only stars).

### What the generated output mixes together
- Your `model*_table1` “Value” column appears to show **standardized betas** (because they match the `beta` column in `model*_full`), but you also include:
  - unstandardized `b` in `model*_full`
  - p-values and stars derived from those models
- This is already a mismatch with the paper’s reporting style, but it’s *fixable* if you compute standardized betas the same way the paper did and then **only report β + stars**, and show the unstandardized constant.

### Fix
To match Table 1:
1. Fit OLS on the same analytic sample as the paper.
2. Compute **standardized coefficients for predictors** (z-score X and Y, or post-hoc standardization).
3. Report:
   - Predictor rows = β
   - Constant row = unstandardized intercept from the unstandardized model
   - R², adj. R², N
   - No SE column (or “—”)

## 2) Massive sample size / missing-data mismatch (driving most other discrepancies)

### Mismatches in N (fit_stats)
- **Model 1**
  - Generated: **n = 747**
  - True: **n = 787**
- **Model 2**
  - Generated: **n = 43** (catastrophically wrong)
  - True: **n = 756**
- **Model 3**
  - Generated: **n = 23** (catastrophically wrong)
  - True: **n = 503**

### Why it happens (visible in your missingness table)
- `hispanic` is **93% missing** in your data (!!), which would obliterate Models 2–3 if you do listwise deletion.
- `pol_intol` is **47% missing**, which would reduce Model 3, but not to 23 if the variable were properly constructed/coded.
- Your Models 2–3 Ns (43, 23) are consistent with **listwise deletion + a mostly-missing Hispanic variable and missing political intolerance**.

### Fix
To match the paper you need to replicate its GSS construction:
- **Recode race/ethnicity dummies correctly** so `hispanic` is not “mostly NA”.
  - In GSS, “Hispanic” often comes from a specific ethnicity/hispanic-origin variable, not from `race` alone, and should not be NA for most respondents.
  - If your `hispanic` comes from a variable that is asked only of a subsample/year, you must use the correct 1993 variable or harmonized variable.
- Construct `pol_intol` exactly as the paper did (likely a multi-item index). Your 47% missing suggests:
  - you built it from items not asked of all respondents, or
  - you required all items non-missing (too strict), or
  - you used the wrong year/variable mapping.
- Only after correct construction should you run **listwise deletion**. The paper’s N dropping from 756 to 503 in Model 3 is plausible; dropping to 23 is not.

## 3) Model fit statistics (R² / adj R²) do not match

### Model 1
- Generated R² = **0.088** vs True **0.107**
- Generated adj R² = **0.085** vs True **0.104**

### Model 2
- Generated R² = **0.462** vs True **0.151** (wildly off)
- Generated adj R² = **0.293** vs True **0.139**

### Model 3
- Generated R² = **0.657** vs True **0.169** (wildly off)
- Generated adj R² = **0.372** vs True **0.148**

### Why
Primarily the **wrong analytic samples** (Ns of 43 and 23 will produce unstable and inflated fit), plus likely **variable construction differences**.

### Fix
Once you fix coding and recover the correct N, R² should come down toward the published values. If it still doesn’t:
- verify the dependent variable construction for “number of music genres disliked” and ensure it matches the paper (range, included genres, missing rules).

## 4) Variable-by-variable coefficient mismatches (β) and sign errors

Below I compare the **True β** to your generated `model*_table1` (which appears to be β). I flag **sign flips**, big magnitude differences, and missing variables.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | magnitude off |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (OK) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | close (OK) |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | mismatch |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | mismatch |
| N | **747** | **787** | mismatch |

**Fix**: Correct sample and DV construction; then re-estimate. Education and intercept differences are consistent with sample differences.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

**Almost everything is wrong, including multiple sign flips.**

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.730** | **-0.246** | huge magnitude mismatch |
| Income pc | **0.109** | **-0.054** | **sign flip** |
| Prestige | **0.406** | **-0.006** | **sign flip + huge** |
| Female | **0.079** | **-0.083** | **sign flip** |
| Age | **0.021** | **0.140** | magnitude mismatch |
| Black | **-0.014** | **0.029** | **sign flip** |
| Hispanic | **-0.020** | **-0.029** | close-ish, but your model has extreme missingness |
| Other race | blank/NA | **0.005** | missing (you have NaN in full output) |
| Cons Protestant | **0.422** | **0.059** | huge mismatch |
| No religion | **0.151** | **-0.012** | **sign flip** |
| Southern | **0.165** | **0.097** | magnitude mismatch |
| Constant | **8.975** | **8.507** | mismatch |
| R² | **0.462** | **0.151** | mismatch |
| N | **43** | **756** | catastrophic mismatch |

**Fix**:
1. Fix `hispanic`/`otherrace` coding so they are not NA and so dummy categories match the paper.
2. Ensure you’re using the correct year (GSS 1993) and correct weighting (if the paper uses weights, apply them).
3. Recreate DV and all predictors identically (esp. age, sex coding, race/ethnicity scheme, religion groups).
4. Re-run with listwise deletion on the corrected variables; N should be ~756.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

Again, multiple sign flips and missing predictors.

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.043** | **-0.151** | magnitude mismatch |
| Income pc | **-0.132** | **-0.009** | huge mismatch |
| Prestige | **0.332** | **-0.022** | **sign flip + huge** |
| Female | **0.288** | **-0.095** | **sign flip** |
| Age | **0.329** | **0.110** | magnitude mismatch |
| Black | **-0.190** | **0.049** | **sign flip** |
| Hispanic | blank/NA | **0.031** | missing due to NA |
| Other race | blank/NA | **0.053** | missing due to NA |
| Cons Protestant | **0.693** | **0.066** | huge mismatch |
| No religion | **0.291** | **0.024** | huge mismatch |
| Southern | **0.267** | **0.121** | magnitude mismatch |
| Political intolerance | **0.221** | **0.164** | mismatch |
| Constant | **-4.545** | **6.516** | **major mismatch** |
| R² | **0.657** | **0.169** | mismatch |
| N | **23** | **503** | catastrophic mismatch |

**Fix**:
- Same as Model 2 plus:
  - Rebuild `pol_intol` index exactly as in the paper (items used, scoring, allowable missing, range 0–15).
  - Don’t compute the index in a way that forces near-complete-case across many items unless that matches the paper; otherwise you’ll destroy N.

---

## 5) Variable-name / labeling mismatches

### Predictor naming
- Generated uses internal names: `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, `age_v`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `pol_intol`.
- True table uses human-readable labels (Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, etc.).

This is not inherently wrong, but your **table presentation must map names consistently**.

### Missing “Other race” coefficient
- Generated Model 2 and Model 3 show `otherrace` as **NaN**, but your pretty table leaves the cell blank.
- True results include **Other race** with small nonzero β.

**Fix**: Ensure `otherrace` is actually estimated:
- Verify it varies (not all 0/1 or perfectly collinear).
- Ensure you have a reference category (e.g., White) and include all needed dummies without the dummy-variable trap.

---

## 6) Significance stars and inference mismatch

- The paper’s stars correspond to its model with correct N and correct variables.
- Your stars are based on a completely different sample (especially Models 2–3), so they cannot match.

**Fix**:
- Once variables and sample match, compute p-values and apply the same thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001).
- Also confirm whether the paper uses **two-tailed** tests (it says it does). Keep two-tailed.

---

## 7) How to make the generated analysis match the true table (checklist)

1. **Filter to GSS 1993** cases used in the paper.
2. **Reconstruct DV**: “Number of Music Genres Disliked” exactly (which genres, how dislike is defined, missing handling).
3. **Recode predictors** to match the paper:
   - education (years)
   - household income per capita (same transformation)
   - occupational prestige (same scale/year)
   - female (0/1 coding)
   - age (years)
   - race/ethnicity dummies including a valid Hispanic indicator (not 93% missing)
   - religion group dummies (esp. “Conservative Protestant” definition)
   - Southern (region definition)
   - political intolerance index (0–15) with paper’s missing-data rule
4. Use **listwise deletion per model** (so N matches 787, 756, 503).
5. Fit OLS; compute **standardized betas** for predictors; report **unstandardized constant**.
6. Report **R²/adj R²/N** and stars using the same p-value cutoffs.

If you share the code you used to create `hispanic`, `otherrace`, and `pol_intol` (and how you computed the DV), I can pinpoint exactly why they’re mostly missing and propose the exact recodes needed.
