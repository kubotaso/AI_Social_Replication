Score: 17/100
============================================================

Below is a complete audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, grouped by: (A) variable names/presence, (B) coefficients/significance, (C) standard errors/p-values, (D) model fit + sample size, and (E) interpretation. For each discrepancy I explain what to change so the generated analysis matches the table.

---

## A) Variable names / included variables / missingness problems

### A1. Variable naming doesn’t match the table (minor but should be aligned)
- **Generated terms:** `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south`, `pol_intol`
- **True table labels:** Education; Household income per capita; Occupational prestige; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern; Political intolerance

**Fix**
- Keep the internal variable names if you want, but **map them to the published labels** in the output table. E.g.:
  - `educ_yrs` → “Education”
  - `inc_pc` → “Household income per capita”
  - `prestg80` → “Occupational prestige”
  - `cons_prot` → “Conservative Protestant”
  - `norelig` → “No religion”
  - `south` → “Southern”
  - `pol_intol` → “Political intolerance”

### A2. `otherrace` and `hispanic` show `NaN` in generated tables (major)
- **Generated Model 2:** `otherrace` is `NaN` (beta and p).
- **Generated Model 3:** `hispanic` and `otherrace` are `NaN`.

This indicates estimation failure for those regressors (commonly perfect collinearity, no variation after listwise deletion, or a coding/merge bug).

**Fix**
- Check coding of race dummies:
  - Ensure you have a single reference category (e.g., White) and **do not include all categories plus an intercept**.
  - Confirm these variables have variation after restricting to the analytic sample.
- Ensure the race variables are coded consistently with the paper:
  - `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` should be **mutually exclusive dummy indicators** with White omitted.
- Verify listwise deletion isn’t collapsing categories:
  - Your Model 2 and 3 samples are tiny (48 and 26), which can easily eliminate all Hispanics/Other race and cause NaNs.

---

## B) Coefficients (β) and direction/significance mismatches (major)

### Important global issue: generated coefficients are not standardized betas
The **True Results** explicitly report **standardized OLS coefficients (β)** (except constants). Your generated “beta” values look like **unstandardized OLS slopes** (and in several cases are wildly different in scale).

**Fix**
- To match the paper, compute standardized coefficients:
  - Standardize DV and all non-binary predictors (or use a standardized-beta routine that matches the paper’s convention).
  - Typical approach: run OLS on z-scored variables (except the intercept), or compute β = b * (SD_x / SD_y).
- Keep the **constant unstandardized** (the paper does).

> If you standardize, many of your “beta” magnitudes should move closer to the table, and sign comparisons become meaningful.

### Model 1 (SES): coefficient mismatches
True (β): Education -0.322***; Income -0.037; Prestige 0.016; Constant 10.920  
Generated: Education -0.329748***; Income -0.033565 (ns); Prestige 0.029083 (ns); Constant 10.832928

**Mismatches**
- **Constant:** 10.8329 vs **10.920** (difference)
- **Prestige:** 0.0291 vs **0.016** (difference)
- **Education:** close (good), Income close-ish (good)

**Fix**
- Use **the same sample definition as the paper** (see section D: your n differs).
- Use **standardized betas** (although Model 1 already looks close, the constant suggests sample mismatch/weighting differences).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic): pervasive coefficient/sign/significance mismatches
True (β):  
- Education **-0.246***  
- Income **-0.054**  
- Prestige **-0.006**  
- Female **-0.083***? (actually -0.083*)  
- Age **0.140***  
- Black 0.029  
- Hispanic -0.029  
- Other race 0.005  
- Cons Prot 0.059  
- No religion -0.012  
- Southern **0.097**  
- Constant 8.507  
- R² 0.151

Generated betas (unstandardized-looking and many wrong directions):  
- Education -0.739400** (too large in magnitude; likely unstandardized + sample issue)  
- Income **+0.092167** (wrong sign vs -0.054)  
- Prestige **+0.447898*** (wrong sign vs -0.006 and implausible scale)  
- Female **+0.011249** (wrong sign vs -0.083*)  
- Age +0.060112 (direction ok but much smaller; also non-sig vs true ***)
- Black +0.004607 (close to 0 but sample too small)
- Hispanic -0.019153 (close-ish but not matching; and later becomes NaN in Model 3)
- Other race NaN (should be 0.005)
- Cons Prot **+0.440254** ** (huge vs 0.059)
- No religion +0.056214 (wrong sign vs -0.012)
- Southern +0.162831 (direction ok but not matching; nonsig vs true **)
- Constant 7.398981 (vs 8.507)

**Fixes**
1. **Reproduce the correct sample size and inclusion criteria** (your n=48 is catastrophically off; see D1).
2. **Compute standardized coefficients** (β) rather than raw slopes.
3. **Verify variable coding**:
   - `female`: should be coded 1=female, 0=male (or vice versa but then interpret accordingly). Your sign suggests you may have reversed it.
   - `south`: confirm region coding matches GSS “South” definition.
   - `cons_prot` and `norelig`: ensure these are correct denominational classifications; misclassification can flip signs.
   - `prestg80`: confirm scale and missing handling; your +0.448 suggests either a different prestige variable, a rescaling error, or an accidental inclusion of a different column.
4. **Use the same weighting (if the paper uses weights).** Differences in constant and coefficients can arise from weighting.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): coefficient/significance mismatches
True (β):  
Education -0.151**; Income -0.009; Prestige -0.022; Female -0.095*; Age 0.110*; Black 0.049; Hispanic 0.031; Other race 0.053; Cons Prot 0.066; No religion 0.024; Southern 0.121**; Political intolerance 0.164***; Constant 6.516; R² 0.169; n=503

Generated:  
- Education -0.194006 (ns) (true **)
- Income -0.054157 (true near 0)
- Prestige +0.269648 (wrong sign vs -0.022)
- Female +0.120599 (wrong sign vs -0.095*)
- Age +0.274388 (much larger; ns vs true *)
- Black -0.067794 (wrong sign vs +0.049)
- Hispanic NaN (should be +0.031)
- Other race NaN (should be +0.053)
- Cons Prot +0.540246* (massively too large vs 0.066)
- No religion +0.056697 (somewhat close-ish direction; true +0.024)
- Southern +0.234969 (too large; ns vs true **)
- Political intolerance +0.057794 (ns; true **0.164***)
- Constant -0.204419 (wildly wrong vs 6.516)

**Fixes**
- Same as Model 2, plus:
  1. **Make sure the DV is the same and not standardized when reporting the constant.** Your constant being ~0 strongly suggests you may have standardized the DV (or centered it) for Model 3 but not for Model 1–2, or otherwise transformed it.
  2. **Ensure `pol_intol` matches the paper’s scale and coding.** If you reverse-coded or standardized differently, the β will differ.
  3. Fix the race dummies so `hispanic` and `otherrace` are estimable.

## C) Standard errors, p-values, and stars (reporting format mismatch)

### C1. True table does NOT report SEs or p-values; generated output does
- True Results: only standardized β and significance stars (no SEs/p-values).
- Generated Results: p-values and significance based on some SEs (not shown but implied).

**Fix**
- To match the paper output: **suppress SE/p-value columns** and show only **β with stars**.
- If you still compute p-values internally to place stars, fine—but don’t display p-values if “matching the table” is the goal.

### C2. Stars/significance mismatches (because coefficients/samples differ)
Examples:
- Model 2 age: generated non-sig; true ***.
- Model 3 pol_intol: generated non-sig; true ***.
- Model 3 education: generated non-sig; true **.
- Model 2 southern: generated non-sig; true **.
- Model 2 female: generated non-sig and wrong sign; true *.

**Fix**
- Once you fix: (i) sample sizes, (ii) standardized β, (iii) coding, the stars should largely align.

---

## D) Model fit statistics and sample sizes (largest discrepancies)

### D1. Sample sizes are completely wrong for Models 2 and 3
- **True n:** Model 1 = 787; Model 2 = 756; Model 3 = 503  
- **Generated n:** Model 1 = 793; Model 2 = 48; Model 3 = 26

This alone guarantees mismatched coefficients, R², constants, and significance.

**Fix**
- Identify what restriction is collapsing n in Models 2–3:
  - accidental `dropna()` across too many columns (e.g., dropping on variables not in the model)
  - incorrect merge/join that keeps only a tiny matched subset
  - filtering to a subgroup unintentionally (e.g., only those with complete `pol_intol` AND some other unrelated vars)
  - reading the wrong year/module or wrong dataset for those models
- Implement **model-specific listwise deletion**:
  - For Model 2: drop missing only on DV + the 11 predictors used in Model 2.
  - For Model 3: drop missing only on DV + the 12 predictors used in Model 3.
- Confirm you are using **GSS 1993** and the same DV construction (“number of music genres disliked”).

### D2. R² / adjusted R² mismatches
- True R²: M1 0.107 (matches closely), M2 0.151 (generated 0.474), M3 0.169 (generated 0.524)
- Generated R² values are inflated, consistent with tiny n and/or overfitting/selection artifacts.

**Fix**
- Fix the sample issue first (D1). With n=48 and many predictors, R² can become unstable and inflated.
- Ensure you’re fitting **OLS** to the same DV, not a transformed DV.

---

## E) Interpretation mismatches

### E1. Interpreting generated coefficients as standardized β would be wrong
Your output column is named `beta`, but appears to be raw slopes. Interpreting those as standardized effects would misstate the paper’s results.

**Fix**
- Either:
  1. **Actually compute standardized β** and keep the label `beta`, or
  2. Rename to `b` (unstandardized) and separately compute/display standardized β.

### E2. Constants are not comparable if DV is standardized/centered in some models
Model 3 constant near 0 (generated) vs 6.516 (true) indicates you likely changed the DV scaling/centering or changed the sample drastically.

**Fix**
- Use the **same DV scale across all models** (the raw count of disliked genres as in the paper).
- Do not z-score the DV if you want to match the constant reported in the table.

# Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Recreate the analytic samples** to match n=787, 756, 503 (model-specific listwise deletion; correct year/data; no bad merges).
2. **Compute standardized coefficients (β)** for all predictors (keep intercept unstandardized).
3. **Fix race dummy coding** so `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` are estimable (no NaNs) with White as reference.
4. **Verify coding direction** for `female`, `south`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, and `pol_intol` against GSS/paper definitions.
5. **Match reporting format**: show β and stars; omit p-values/SEs (since Table 1 omits them).
6. Recompute **R²/adj R²** and ensure they align (M1≈.107; M2≈.151; M3≈.169).

If you paste the code (or at least the exact variable construction and filtering steps), I can pinpoint exactly where n collapses to 48/26 and which variables are miscoded.
