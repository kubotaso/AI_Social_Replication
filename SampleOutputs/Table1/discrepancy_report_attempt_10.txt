============================================================

### 1) Sample size / missing-data handling mismatches (major)

**Mismatch**
- Generated **N**: Model 1 = **758**, Model 2 = **306**, Model 3 = **171**  
- True **N**: Model 1 = **787**, Model 2 = **756**, Model 3 = **503**
- Generated diagnostics show progressive listwise deletion across growing variable sets (and *very* heavy loss in Models 2–3), which is not what the published table reports.

**Why it matters**
- Coefficients, constants, R², Adj. R², and p-values all change with N and the composition of the estimation sample. Your generated results are clearly estimated on a much smaller (and different) subset.

**How to fix**
- Recreate the paper’s estimation samples:
  - Ensure the **dependent variable** is exactly “number of music genres disliked” and coded identically.
  - Use the **same wave/year** and the same subset restrictions as the paper.
  - Apply **the same missing-data rule** as the authors. The published N’s imply:
    - Model 2 is *not* using only 306 complete cases; it retains 756.
    - Model 3 retains 503 (not 171).
- Practically:
  - Audit missingness by variable and confirm you are not accidentally treating special codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) as real values or as NA incorrectly.
  - Do **not** create derived variables (e.g., `inc_pc`) in a way that introduces new missingness (division by zero, missing household size, etc.) unless that matches the paper.
  - If you used “complete.cases(all predictors across all models)” globally, stop: each model should have its **own** listwise deletion set (or the authors’ specified approach).

### 2) Variable inclusion mismatch: `no_religion` is wrongly dropped

**Mismatch**
- Generated: `no_religion` is marked `dropped_no_variance` and `included=False` in Models 2 and 3.
- True table: **No religion is included in Models 2 and 3** with coefficients:
  - Model 2: **-0.012**
  - Model 3: **0.024**

**Likely cause**
- You accidentally made `no_religion` constant within the (already too-small) estimation sample (306/171 cases), so software dropped it.
- Or it was coded incorrectly (e.g., all 0/1 reversed, or all missing recoded to 0).

**How to fix**
- Fix the sample first (see section 1); this alone may restore variance.
- Verify coding:
  - `no_religion` should be a 0/1 indicator (or a set of religion dummies with one omitted reference).  
  - Confirm it is not all missing after recoding.
- If religion is categorical, build it the same way as the paper (e.g., include **both** `conserv_prot` and `no_religion` as separate dummies, with another category as reference).

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (direction, magnitude, significance)

Below are **systematic mismatches** between generated standardized betas and the printed standardized betas.

#### Education
- Generated: **-0.332*** (M1), **-0.326*** (M2), **-0.070** (M3)
- True: **-0.322*** (M1), **-0.246*** (M2), **-0.151** (M3)

**Problems**
- M2 too negative; M3 far too close to 0 and loses significance.

**Fix**
- Same as above: correct sample + confirm you are standardizing the same way (see section 6).

#### Female
- Generated: **-0.066** (M2), **-0.090** (M3) (both not significant)
- True: **-0.083***? actually **-0.083*** is printed as * (p<.05), and **-0.095***? printed as * (p<.05)

**Fix**
- Correct N (power) + ensure `female` coding matches (0/1 with same reference; not 1=male).

#### Age
- Generated: **0.107** (M2, p≈0.059), **0.141** (M3, p≈0.073)
- True: **0.140*** (M2, p<.001), **0.110*** (M3, p<.05)

**Fix**
- Sample mismatch again. Also verify age transformation: if the paper uses linear age in years, do not use age categories, centering, or logged age.

#### Race variables (black, hispanic, other_race) — sign flips and size differences
- **Black**
  - Generated: **-0.008** (M2), **-0.043** (M3)
  - True: **+0.029** (M2), **+0.049** (M3)
- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **+0.060** (M2), **+0.173*** (M3)
  - True: **-0.029** (M2), **+0.031** (M3)
- **Other race**
  - Generated: **+0.007** (M2), **+0.085** (M3)
  - True: **+0.005** (M2), **+0.053** (M3)

**Likely causes**
- Different reference category or different dummy construction than the paper.
- Misclassification from recode (e.g., “Hispanic” treated as race vs ethnicity; the paper may define Hispanic ethnicity separately with race dummies among non-Hispanics, etc.).
- Again, tiny N in generated M3 will destabilize subgroup estimates.

**Fix**
- Reconstruct race/ethnicity exactly as in the authors’ codebook:
  - Confirm whether “Hispanic” is an ethnicity indicator independent of race, and what the reference group is (usually White non-Hispanic).
  - Ensure dummies are mutually exclusive if that’s how the paper does it.

#### Southern
- Generated: **0.142** (M2, **p=.008**), **0.151** (M3, *p=.047*)
- True: **0.097** (M2, **), **0.121** (M3, **)

**Fix**
- Sample mismatch + possibly different “South” definition (Census South vs “born in South”, etc.).

#### Political intolerance (polintol)
- Generated: **0.214** (**, p=.0068)
- True: **0.164*** (***)

**Fix**
- Ensure the scale construction matches (items included, reverse coding, standardization) and restore N=503. With correct N and scale, coefficient and p-level should move toward printed values.

### 4) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj. R², constants)

**Mismatch**
- **R²**
  - Generated: 0.1088 (M1), 0.1830 (M2), 0.1708 (M3)
  - True: 0.107 (M1), 0.151 (M2), 0.169 (M3)
- **Adj R²**
  - Generated: 0.1052, 0.1553, 0.1134
  - True: 0.104, 0.139, 0.148
- **Constants**
  - Generated: 11.086, 9.859, 4.639
  - True: 10.920, 8.507, 6.516

**Likely causes**
- Wrong sample (again).
- Wrong dependent variable scaling (e.g., you may have standardized DV, capped it, or used a different count definition).
- Wrong model specification (e.g., different set of controls, different coding of predictors).
- If you computed **standardized betas by standardizing variables before regression**, the constant becomes the mean of standardized DV (≈0). Your constants are not ≈0, implying you did **not** fully standardize DV—fine—but then constants should align with the paper if DV matches.

**Fix**
- Verify DV exactly (count of disliked genres, range, handling of “don’t know/never heard”).
- Match model specification and sample.
- Don’t compare your **unstandardized intercept** to a table if the paper used different centering/standardization conventions; however, the paper prints a constant on the original DV scale, so you likely just have the wrong DV/sample.

---

### 5) “Standard errors” mismatch: you can’t compare what isn’t reported

**Mismatch**
- User request includes “standard errors,” but the true table explicitly says **SEs are not printed**.

**Fix**
- If you want your generated output to “match” the table, **do not present SEs as if they are comparable** to Table 1.
- Instead:
  - Compare standardized coefficients and significance stars only, or
  - Obtain SEs from the authors’ replication files / supplementary materials, or compute them on the correct data and then treat them as *your* SEs (not “true from the PDF”).

---

### 6) Standardization / interpretation mismatches (beta_std construction)

**Mismatch**
- Your `beta_std` appears to be a standardized coefficient, but the discrepancies suggest it may not match the paper’s standardization protocol.

**Common pitfalls**
- Standardizing X’s but not Y (or vice versa).
- Using sample SD computed on a different sample than the model’s estimation sample.
- Using weighted vs unweighted SDs (papers often use survey weights).

**Fix**
- Replicate the authors’ method:
  - If the paper uses standardized coefficients from OLS, it’s typically: run OLS on original variables and then compute **beta = b * sd(X)/sd(Y)** using the **same estimation sample** (and weights if used).
  - If survey data: check whether the paper uses **weights**; weighted standardization changes betas and SEs.

---

### 7) Significance stars mismatch

**Mismatch examples**
- Generated Model 3 education is nonsignificant; true is ** (p<.01).
- Generated Model 2 age is marginal; true is ***.
- Generated Model 3 political intolerance is **; true is ***.

**Fix**
- Primarily fixed by correct sample + correct variable construction.
- Then ensure p-values are computed appropriately (OLS vs design-based SEs if survey).

## What to change in the generated analysis so it matches the “true” table

1) **Rebuild the analysis dataset** to reproduce N’s: **787 / 756 / 503** per model.  
2) **Fix `no_religion` coding** so it is not constant and is included in Models 2–3.  
3) **Recode race/ethnicity dummies** to match Table 1 naming and reference category (likely White non-Hispanic reference).  
4) **Verify DV construction** (“# of genres disliked”) including handling of missing/“never heard.”  
5) **Match standardization and (if applicable) survey weights** exactly.  
6) Only compare what the table reports: **standardized coefficients + stars**, unless you have an external source for SEs.

If you share the code that constructs `inc_pc`, `no_religion`, race/ethnicity, `polintol`, and the DV, I can pinpoint the exact recode or filtering step that is collapsing N to 306/171 and flipping signs.
