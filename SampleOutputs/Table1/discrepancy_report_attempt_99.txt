Below is a term-by-term audit of **every mismatch** between the *Generated Results* and the *True Results (Table 1)*, covering **variable names, coefficients, (non‑existent) SEs, model fit stats, N, and interpretation/stars**—plus what to change so the generated output matches Table 1.

---

## 1) Core structural discrepancy: your “table1_style” implies SE rows exist (they do not)

### What you generated
- `table1_style` shows each coefficient followed by an unlabeled second line that *looks like* a standard error row (e.g., `-0.330***` then `-0.045`), even though your own diagnostics note says: “Table shows standardized betas only; no SE rows.”

### What is true
- The PDF’s Table 1 prints **standardized coefficients only** and **does not print standard errors**.

### Fix
- Remove the “SE-like” second-line numbers from `table1_style` entirely (or explicitly label them as something else if they are not SEs).
- If you want SEs, you must compute them from the microdata and then **you are no longer matching Table 1** (because Table 1 doesn’t report them). For matching, omit SEs.

---

## 2) Variable name mismatches (labeling)

### What you generated (names in `coefficients_long`)
- `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`

### What is true (Table 1 labels)
- Education
- Household income per capita
- Occupational prestige
- Female
- Age
- Black
- Hispanic
- Other race
- Conservative Protestant
- No religion
- Southern
- Political intolerance

### Fix
- Relabel variables in the final table output to match Table 1 exactly (labels are part of “matching”).
- Example mapping:
  - `educ` → **Education**
  - `income_pc` → **Household income per capita**
  - `prestg80` → **Occupational prestige**
  - etc.

*(This is cosmetic but required if you’re claiming to reproduce Table 1 “as printed.”)*

**Bottom line:** coefficients, constants, fit stats, and N do not reproduce Table 1. The gaps are too large to be rounding error; they indicate you are not fitting the same models on the same estimation samples / same coding / same standardization scheme.

---

## 4) Significance/star mismatches (interpretation)

Your stars are based on your own p-values (from your OLS fit), but Table 1’s stars correspond to the paper’s model(s)/sample(s). Because your coefficients and N differ, stars often differ too.

### Examples (clear mismatches)
- **Demographic Model: Female**
  - Generated: female p≈0.083 → no star
  - True: **-0.083*** (actually * in Table 1) → should be significant at p<.05
- **Demographic Model: Age**
  - Generated: 0.117 * (p≈0.012)
  - True: 0.140 *** (p<.001)
- **Demographic Model: Southern**
  - Generated: 0.056 (ns)
  - True: 0.097 **

- **Political Intolerance Model: Political intolerance**
  - Generated: 0.174 ** (p≈0.009)
  - True: 0.164 *** (p<.001)

### Fix
- You cannot “fix stars” independently. To match the stars, you must match:
  1) the **sample**,  
  2) the **exact variable coding**,  
  3) the **exact standardization method**, and  
  4) any **weighting/design corrections** used in the original.

Only then will p-values and stars align.

---

## 5) Sample size (N) mismatches are massive and are the biggest red flag

### Generated N vs True N
- SES: 690 vs **787**
- Demographic: 447 vs **756**
- Political intolerance: 252 vs **503**

Your own missingness tables show why your N collapses:
- `hispanic` has **302 missing** (893 nonmissing DV → only 591 hispanic nonmissing)
- `political_intolerance` has **402 missing** (→ only 491 nonmissing)
- then you do **listwise deletion**, pushing N to 447 and 252.

### What this implies
Table 1’s authors are **not** treating `hispanic` as missing for 302 cases in the same way you are, or they are using:
- different year/subsample restrictions,
- different recodes (e.g., coding missing as 0 for indicator variables, or constructing race/ethnicity differently),
- imputation,
- or a different data source/extract.

### Fix (most likely needed)
1) **Recreate race/ethnicity indicators exactly as the paper does.**
   - Your `hispanic` variable appears to be missing for many respondents where it should likely be 0/1.
   - Common fix: if “Hispanic” is derived from a separate ethnicity question, you must code **non-Hispanic as 0**, not NA.
2) **Do not treat structurally-inapplicable cases as missing** for binary dummies.
3) Verify that `other_race` is constructed mutually exclusively with `black` and `hispanic` consistent with the paper.

Until the **N matches**, you should assume coefficients won’t match either.

---

## 6) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj R², constants)

All three models have lower R² in your output than Table 1, consistent with:
- different samples,
- different variable coding/standardization,
- possibly weights.

Constants differ by ~0.1 to 1.3, which is very hard to reconcile if everything else matched.

### Fix
- Once sample and coding match, re-check:
  - whether the DV is standardized or not (Table 1 uses standardized coefficients but the constant is on the raw DV scale),
  - whether predictors were standardized (for standardized betas, typically yes; but implementations vary).

---

## 7) Standardization method mismatch (likely)

You label coefficients as `beta_std`. Table 1 reports “standardized OLS coefficients.” But “standardized” can mean:
- standardize all X and Y then run OLS (gives standardized slopes; constant becomes ~0), **or**
- compute standardized betas from an unstandardized regression:  \( \beta^* = b \cdot \frac{s_x}{s_y} \) (constant remains on original Y scale).

Because Table 1 shows **nonzero constants**, they almost certainly did **not** standardize Y before estimating (or they back-reported the raw constant separately).

Your constants are also nonzero, so you’re also not standardizing Y, but your betas still don’t match—suggesting either:
- you standardize X differently (sample-weighted SD vs unweighted),
- you use a different estimation sample for SD computation (e.g., SD computed on full sample vs model sample),
- or the predictors are not coded identically.

### Fix
- To match Table 1:
  1) run the **same unstandardized model** the authors ran,
  2) compute standardized betas using the **same SD definitions** on the **same sample** used in the model,
  3) report raw constant separately.

---

## 8) Interpretation mismatch: your note contradicts your printed table

- Your diagnostics note: “Table shows standardized betas only; no SE rows.”
- But the table visually includes extra rows after each coefficient that a reader will interpret as SEs.

### Fix
- Make the table formatting consistent with the note and with Table 1:
  - one row per variable per model for standardized coefficients,
  - then constant, R², Adj R², N.

---

## 9) What to change concretely so the generated analysis matches Table 1

In priority order:

1) **Fix the construction of `hispanic` (and possibly race variables) so it is not missing for hundreds of cases.**
   - Recode: if ethnicity is known, set `hispanic = 1` for Hispanic, `0` for non-Hispanic.
   - Ensure `black`, `other_race` dummies match the paper’s scheme (mutually exclusive categories, correct reference group).

2) **Match the paper’s analytic sample restrictions exactly** (year, age range, exclusions).
   - Your diagnostics show `N_year_1993 = 1606` but DV complete is 893; Table 1 N starts at 787—so there are additional restrictions you may not be matching, *and* you are also losing too many cases later from NA coding.

3) **Use the same missing-data handling as the paper.**
   - If the paper uses listwise deletion, then after correct recodes N should match closely.
   - If not, you need the same imputation/indicator methods.

4) **Ensure the DV matches exactly (“Number of music genres disliked”).**
   - Same items, same counting rule, same treatment of “don’t know/refused,” same range.

5) **Recompute standardized coefficients exactly as the paper does** (and only after #1–#4 are aligned).
   - Confirm whether betas are computed from the model-sample SDs.
   - Do not print SEs.

6) **Update stars to reflect the matched model p-values** (two-tailed thresholds: .05/.01/.001).

If you share (a) the code you used to build `hispanic`, `other_race`, and `political_intolerance`, and (b) the exact sample filters, I can point to the precise line-level causes of the N collapse and the sign flips (notably prestige, hispanic, other_race) and specify the exact recodes needed to reproduce the Table 1 numbers.
