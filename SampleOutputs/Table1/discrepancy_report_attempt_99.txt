### 1) Fit statistics (n, R², adj. R²) — all mismatched

| Item | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| **Model 1 n** | 747 | 787 | Too few cases | Use the same sample restrictions/case handling as the paper (likely listwise deletion on *only* Model 1 vars; don’t inadvertently drop on vars not in the model). |
| **Model 1 R² / adj R²** | 0.088 / 0.0846 | 0.107 / 0.104 | Underestimated | Once the sample and variable coding match, recompute. Also ensure you’re reporting OLS R² from the same model specification (no weights vs weights mismatch can change R²). |
| **Model 2 n** | 507 | 756 | Massive case loss | You are listwise-deleting on something you shouldn’t (very likely race/ethnicity or religion variables coded as missing more often in your extract than in the paper; or you mistakenly included `pol_intol` in the model-2 frame at some preprocessing step). Rebuild Model 2 dataset using *only* the Model 2 variables and correct missing codes. |
| **Model 2 R² / adj R²** | 0.138 / 0.119 | 0.151 / 0.139 | Doesn’t match | Fix sample, coding, and standardization (see below). |
| **Model 3 n** | 286 | 503 | Massive case loss | Your `pol_intol` is missing for a huge share; plus you dropped `hispanic` entirely (see §3). The paper’s Model 3 keeps 503 cases, so your construction of `pol_intol` (or the variable source/year) is not aligned. Use the correct GSS 1993 items and missing codes; don’t recode valid answers to NA. |
| **Model 3 R² / adj R²** | 0.148 / 0.114 | 0.169 / 0.148 | Too low | Same root causes: wrong sample + wrong variable definitions/coding. |

### 2) Variable names / reporting scale problems (β vs b)

**True Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β) and constants unstandardized.**  
Your “model*_table1style” tables appear to report **standardized betas** for predictors (good), but your “model*_full” tables mix in **unstandardized b** and you then sometimes interpret/star based on p-values from the unstandardized model.

**Key mismatch:** the “generated” coefficients often don’t match the true β even when the sign matches → meaning your standardization procedure and/or sample differs from the paper.

**Fix**
- To match Table 1, estimate OLS on the raw variables, then compute standardized coefficients *for predictors* using the same sample:  
  \[
  \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(x_j)}{SD(y)}
  \]
- Do **not** standardize the intercept; keep constant as the unstandardized intercept from the unstandardized regression.
- Ensure the same coding (0/1 dummies, reference groups) and the same analytic sample as the paper before computing SDs.

---

### 3) Model 3 “Hispanic” is missing/dropped — direct mismatch

- **Generated Model 3:** `Hispanic` coefficient is `NaN`, and fit_stats says `dropped hispanic`.
- **True Model 3:** Hispanic is included with **β = 0.031**.

**What’s wrong**
- Perfect collinearity or no variation in `hispanic` within the Model 3 estimation sample, *or* you mistakenly merged/recoded `hispanic` so it becomes all-missing or all-zero after filtering to `pol_intol` nonmissing.

Your own missingness table strongly suggests a coding problem:
- `hispanic` shows **mean 0.003831** (≈0.38%), which is implausibly low for GSS; that indicates you have probably coded Hispanic incorrectly (e.g., using the wrong variable, wrong year, or treating most valid values as missing).

**Fix**
- Verify the correct GSS Hispanic indicator for 1993 and its coding (and how the paper defines it). Common errors:
  - Using a variable where Hispanic is a multi-category code and recoding only “1” as Hispanic but failing to map other Hispanic codes.
  - Treating “inapplicable / don’t know / not asked” as missing when it should be 0 in this constructed dummy (depending on the original measure).
- Recreate race/ethnicity dummies from the same base variable(s) the paper uses, then check that `hispanic` has a realistic prevalence and varies in the Model 3 sample.
- After recoding, rerun Model 3; `hispanic` should no longer drop and should produce a finite coefficient.

### 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Table 1 βs)

Below I compare your **table1style** βs to the **true** βs (because that’s what Table 1 reports).

#### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | Too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | Slight difference |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | Slight difference |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | Too low |
| R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | Too low |
| n | 747 | 787 | Too low |

**Fix:** sample alignment (n) + correct standardization SDs using that sample.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.266*** | -0.246*** | Too negative |
| Income pc | -0.054 | -0.054 | Matches |
| Prestige | -0.010 | -0.006 | Slight difference |
| Female | -0.089* | -0.083* | Slight difference |
| Age | 0.102* | 0.140*** | **Big mismatch** (size + significance) |
| Black | 0.037 | 0.029 | Slight |
| Hispanic | -0.033 | -0.029 | Slight |
| Other race | -0.027 | 0.005 | **Sign mismatch** |
| Cons Prot | 0.083 | 0.059 | Too large |
| No religion | -0.018 | -0.012 | Slight |
| Southern | 0.060 | 0.097** | **Too small; loses significance** |
| Constant | 9.663 | 8.507 | **Big mismatch** |
| R² / adj R² | 0.138 / 0.119 | 0.151 / 0.139 | Too low |
| n | 507 | 756 | **Huge mismatch** |

**Fix:** The huge n drop almost certainly drives the Age/Southern/Other-race discrepancies. Rebuild the Model 2 analytic file correctly (same missing codes, same dummy construction, same year, same weighting decision as paper). Once n≈756, these should move substantially toward the published βs and stars.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157* | -0.151** | Similar size; star differs |
| Income pc | -0.050 | -0.009 | **Huge mismatch** |
| Prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | Moderate |
| Female | -0.126* | -0.095* | Too negative |
| Age | 0.091 | 0.110* | Too small; loses significance |
| Black | 0.085 | 0.049 | Too large |
| Hispanic | (blank/NA) | 0.031 | **Dropped entirely** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | Matches |
| Cons Prot | 0.038 | 0.066 | Too small |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.024 | Matches |
| Southern | 0.068 | 0.121** | Too small; loses significance |
| Political intolerance | 0.183** | 0.164*** | Too large; star differs |
| Constant | 7.635 | 6.516 | Too high |
| R² / adj R² | 0.148 / 0.114 | 0.169 / 0.148 | Too low |
| n | 286 | 503 | **Huge mismatch** |

**Fix:** (1) Fix `pol_intol` construction and missingness; (2) fix Hispanic coding so it’s included; (3) ensure income per capita is scaled/coded like the paper (see next section). With correct n≈503, income’s β should likely shrink toward -0.009.

---

### 5) Income per capita scaling/coding appears inconsistent (especially Model 3)

Your Model 3 β for income per capita is **-0.050**, but the true β is **-0.009**. That is not a small drift; it suggests one (or more) of:

- You used a different income concept (e.g., raw household income instead of per-capita, or a transformed version).
- You used a different scaling (e.g., dollars vs thousands) *combined with* an incorrect standardization step (β should be scale-invariant if computed correctly from b and SDs within-sample—but if you’re mixing samples or using SDs from a different dataset, β can be wrong).
- Sample selection: the small Model 3 sample (n=286) could be unusually income-skewed, inflating the standardized effect.

**Fix**
- Confirm `inc_pc` matches the paper’s definition exactly (household income divided by household size, consistent top-coding, inflation adjustments if any).
- Compute β using the **same estimation sample** SD(y) and SD(x). Don’t reuse SDs from the full dataset if the regression used a smaller listwise-deleted frame.

---

### 6) Standard errors: you’re reporting SEs/p-values but the “true” table does not

The “true results” explicitly: **SEs not reported** in Table 1. Your generated output includes p-values and significance stars derived from your estimation.

**Mismatch in interpretation**
- You cannot claim to “match Table 1” on SEs because Table 1 doesn’t provide them.
- Also, your stars won’t match unless you replicate *exactly* the same estimation choices (weights, robust vs classical SEs, exact sample, exact coding).

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match the paper’s Table 1: report **β and stars only** (and constants), and ensure stars are computed using the same inferential method as the paper (often conventional OLS SEs, but could be weighted, design-based, etc.).
- If you want to keep SEs: label them as **computed from your replication**, not “extracted from Table 1.”

---

### 7) Missingness table contains internal inconsistencies / red flags

- `pol_intol n=850, missing=756` implies only 94 nonmissing, but your Model 3 frame has 286 rows with `pol_intol` present. That’s inconsistent with the missingness row as printed (unless the printed columns are misaligned or “missing” is not actually missing count).
- `hispanic` mean ≈ 0.004 suggests the dummy is essentially always 0, contradicting typical GSS distributions and the fact the paper estimates a Hispanic effect.

**Fix**
- Recompute missingness with clearly defined metrics (N total, N missing, % missing) and validate against the model frames.
- Audit recodes: verify that missing codes (e.g., 8, 9, 98, 99) were converted to NA **before** creating dummies and composites, and that valid categories were not mistakenly set to NA.

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true Table 1

1. **Recreate the analytic samples separately for each model** using *only* the variables in that model (listwise deletion within-model), targeting the published n’s: 787, 756, 503.
2. **Fix Hispanic coding** (wrong dummy; currently near-zero prevalence) so it varies and is not dropped in Model 3.
3. **Fix political intolerance construction** so it exists for ~503 cases (your current `pol_intol` missingness is far too high and inconsistent).
4. **Compute standardized β correctly** from the unstandardized regression within the same estimation sample; keep intercept unstandardized.
5. **Align modeling choices with the paper** (especially weights and handling of survey design). If the paper uses weights and you don’t (or vice versa), βs, R², and stars can differ.
6. **Only claim “match” on what the table reports**: β, constants, R², adj R², n, and stars (SEs are not in the true table).

If you share the code you used to construct `hispanic` and `pol_intol` (and whether you used GSS weights), I can pinpoint exactly why n collapses and why specific coefficients (Age, Southern, income) diverge so much.
