Score: 21/100
============================================================

## 1) Variable-name and model-specification mismatches

### A. Dependent variable label mismatch (likely)
- **Generated DV** (in `estimation_samples`): `genres_disliked_count`
- **True DV (Table 1)**: “**Number of music genres disliked**”
- This is probably the same construct, but the generated output should **label the DV exactly as in the table** to avoid ambiguity.

**Fix:** Rename the DV in the write-up/table (not necessarily in the dataset) to match Table 1 wording: *Number of music genres disliked*.

---

### B. Household income variable may not match the paper’s construction
- **Generated term**: `income_pc`
- **True Table 1**: “**Household income per capita**”
- The name is fine, but the bigger issue is that the *coefficients don’t match* (see below), which often happens when:
  - income is not equivalized the same way,
  - different units/scaling are used (raw dollars vs. logged vs. standardized),
  - different missing-data rules are used.

**Fix:** Reproduce the paper’s exact income-per-capita construction (household income ÷ household size, any top-coding rules, inflation adjustments, etc.) and then standardize exactly as the paper did for the “standardized coefficient” table.

---

### C. Race/ethnicity coding likely differs from the paper
Your model uses `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` (dummies). The paper lists Black, Hispanic, Other race—so conceptually aligned. But your **sample sizes collapse hard** (Model 2 N=523) and diagnostics show only **56 Hispanics with nonmissing** in some count, suggesting you may be handling missingness/coding differently than the original.

**Fix:**
- Ensure mutually exclusive categories exactly as the paper: e.g., White (reference), Black, Hispanic, Other.
- Confirm whether “Hispanic” overrides race (common in survey recodes).
- Recreate missing-value handling (don’t turn system missing into 0, don’t inadvertently drop cases via constructed dummies).

- **N**: **332 vs 503** (massive mismatch)

## 3) Standard error mismatches (conceptual/formatting error)

### A. Your table prints “standard errors” but Table 1 does not
- **True**: “Table 1 … reports standardized coefficients only and does not print standard errors.”
- **Generated**: `table1_style` shows a second line under each coefficient (e.g., “-0.332***” then “-0.034”). Those second-line numbers are **not SEs** in any defensible way; they appear to be **the next coefficient** (income) printed on a new row without labels.

So the “SE mismatch” is: **you are outputting SE-like rows even though the true table has none**, and additionally your formatting is misleading.

**Fix options (pick one):**
1. **Match the PDF**: output **only standardized betas** and stars; remove SE lines entirely.
2. If you want SEs anyway, **compute and clearly label them** (but then it won’t match Table 1). Also don’t compare them to Table 1 because Table 1 has none.

### B. The `table1_style` object is unlabeled / row names missing
The top block has numbers with many `NaN` but **no variable names**—so it’s impossible to verify which number corresponds to which variable without cross-walking to `coefficients_long`.

**Fix:** Print a properly labeled table with rows = variable names and columns = models, with blanks (not NaN) for excluded variables.

## 4) Interpretation/significance mismatches

Your significance stars (based on `p_raw`) do **not** reproduce the paper’s stars, because:
- your coefficients differ, and
- your **N differs drastically**, changing SEs/p-values,
- you may be using different standardization and/or different missing-data rules.

Concrete mismatches:
- Model 2: **Female** is * in the paper, but ~p=.061 in your run (no star).
- Model 2: **Age** is *** in paper, only * in your run.
- Model 2: **Southern** is ** in paper, ~p=.061 in your run (no star).
- Model 3: **Education** is ** in paper, only * in your run.
- Model 3: **Age** is * in paper, ns in your run.
- Model 3: **Southern** is ** in paper, ns in your run.

**Fix:** You won’t “tune” stars; you must **replicate the same analytic sample and variable construction** as the paper so the underlying estimates align.

---

## 5) The biggest source of mismatch: **analytic sample (N) is wrong**

True N’s: **787, 756, 503**  
Generated N’s: **758, 523, 332**

That’s not a rounding issue; it implies your code is dropping far more cases, especially once demographics and political intolerance are introduced.

Likely causes:
1. **Overly strict listwise deletion** (dropping cases that the paper retained by different missing rules).
2. Incorrectly treating “don’t know / refused / not asked” as missing for key predictors.
3. Political intolerance scale construction: your diagnostics show multiple intermediate Ns (`N_polintol_15complete`, `ge13items`, etc.). You ended with **566 nonmissing final**, yet Model 3 N is **332**, so you’re losing an additional ~234 cases when adding other covariates—suggesting missingness in demographics/religion variables is being handled differently than in the paper.

**Fix (must-do to match Table 1):**
- Recreate the paper’s **exact inclusion rules per model**:
  - Model 1: require nonmissing DV + SES vars only.
  - Model 2: require nonmissing DV + SES + demographic vars.
  - Model 3: require nonmissing DV + SES + demographic + political intolerance.
- Audit missingness *variable by variable* and compare counts to the paper’s appendix/notes (if available).
- If the paper used imputation or specific recodes for missing categories (e.g., “no religion” includes missing/none), implement that.

## 6) How to fix the generated analysis so it matches the true table

### Step-by-step correction checklist

1. **Match the output format**
   - Remove SE lines; print **standardized betas only**.
   - Add row labels identical to the PDF (Education, Household income per capita, etc.).
   - Use blanks (—) for non-included variables.

2. **Replicate standardization**
   - Confirm whether the paper standardized:
     - all predictors and the outcome (yielding beta = OLS on z-scored variables), **or**
     - only predictors (common but not universal).
   - Your betas appear to come from a standardization pipeline; ensure it matches the paper’s exact method (including handling of binary predictors—standardizing dummies changes interpretation but is consistent with “standardized coefficients”).

3. **Fix the analytic samples (the biggest issue)**
   - Compute N for each model based solely on variables in that model.
   - Ensure you are not accidentally requiring additional variables (e.g., constructing `income_pc` might require household size; if household size missing, you drop cases—paper may have different handling).

4. **Rebuild political intolerance exactly**
   - Your “political_intolerance” variable ranges (0–7 in sample) suggest a count/scale, but the paper’s construction matters a lot.
   - Match:
     - item selection,
     - minimum answered items rule,
     - whether “don’t know” is treated as 0/neutral/missing,
     - scaling (sum vs mean), and then standardization.

5. **Recheck coding of demographics and religion**
   - Ensure reference categories match the paper (e.g., male, non-southern, white, non–conservative protestant, religious vs none, etc.).
   - Verify “female” is coded 1=female, 0=male (not reversed).
   - Verify “southern” definition matches.

6. **Only after 1–5, compare coefficients**
   - Once Ns align (787/756/503), most coefficient and star mismatches should shrink substantially. If they don’t, the remaining problem is almost certainly variable construction/scaling.

If you share the code that generated `genres_disliked_count`, `income_pc`, and `political_intolerance` (especially missing handling), I can point to the exact lines causing the N collapse and the coefficient/sign reversals.
