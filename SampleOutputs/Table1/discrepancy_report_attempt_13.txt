### 1) Fit statistics: **R²/Adj. R² and N do not match (major)**
**Generated**
- Model 1: **n=793**, R²=**0.1076**, adj R²=**0.1042**
- Model 2: **n=37**, R²=**0.4892**, adj R²=**0.3433**
- Model 3: **n=19**, R²=**0.5882**, adj R²=**0.1763**

**True**
- Model 1: **n=787**, R²=**0.107**, adj R²=**0.104**
- Model 2: **n=756**, R²=**0.151**, adj R²=**0.139**
- Model 3: **n=503**, R²=**0.169**, adj R²=**0.148**

**Mismatches**
- Model 1: N is off (793 vs 787). R²/adj R² are close (OK-ish) but not exact.
- Model 2 & 3: N is catastrophically wrong (37 and 19 instead of 756 and 503). R² wildly wrong as a consequence.

**How to fix**
- Your models are being fit on a tiny complete-case subset because several predictors are coming in as all-missing/mostly-missing (see §4).  
- Ensure you are using the same GSS 1993 sample restrictions as the paper and that all IVs are properly coded (especially race/ethnicity/religion dummies and political intolerance).
- Explicitly reproduce the paper’s case selection:
  - Build the model matrix first, then drop rows with any missing in DV + included IVs.
  - Verify resulting N matches 787/756/503 by model.
- If you are standardizing, confirm whether you standardize variables **before** listwise deletion or **after** (the paper’s betas implicitly come from the estimation sample).

### 2) Coefficients: **you report mostly the wrong quantities (and many signs differ)**
The paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (and unstandardized constants). Your generated “tables” display values that do not match the true β’s, and your raw table mixes **unstandardized b** and **standardized beta**, but your *displayed* numbers often don’t equal either the true β or your own beta.

#### Model 1 (SES)
**True β**
- Education: **-0.322***  
- Income pc: **-0.037**  
- Prestige: **0.016**  
- Constant: **10.920**

**Generated (display)**
- Education: **-0.330*** (close-ish)
- Income pc: **-0.034** (close-ish)
- Prestige: **0.029** (too high)
- Constant: **10.833*** (should not have stars in Table 1; also differs)

**Generated (raw_coef_tables beta)**
- educ_yrs beta **-0.3297** (close)
- inc_pc beta **-0.0336** (close)
- prestg80 beta **0.0291** (does not match true 0.016)
- Constant b **10.8329** (true 10.920)

**Fix**
- Make sure prestige variable coding matches the paper (e.g., whether it uses `prestg80`, a different prestige measure, or different handling of missing/“DK/NA”). Small differences here can move β.
- Do **not** add significance stars to the constant if you’re reproducing Table 1 (paper only star-marked predictors).
- Ensure your “display” column is printing **beta** (standardized) for predictors, not a mix.

#### Model 2 (Demographic): **almost everything is wrong**
**True β signs and magnitudes**
- Education **-0.246*** (negative)
- Income pc **-0.054** (negative)
- Prestige **-0.006** (≈0, slightly negative)
- Female **-0.083***? (actually * p<.05; negative)
- Age **0.140*** (positive)
- Southern **0.097** ** (positive)
(others small)

**Generated betas (raw_coef_tables)**
- Education beta **-0.7956** (**far too large**)
- Income beta **+0.1823** (**wrong sign**)
- Prestige beta **+0.4255** (**wrong sign and huge**)
- Female beta **+0.0766** (**wrong sign**)
- Age beta **-0.0183** (**wrong sign**)
- Southern beta **+0.2243** (too large)

Also, several variables are **NaN** (Hispanic, Other race, No religion), meaning they were not actually estimated—yet you still list them in the table (blank entries).

**Fix**
- First fix the missing-data/coding problem that is collapsing N (see §4). With N=37, standardized coefficients become unstable/extreme—explaining the huge betas and sign flips.
- Confirm the direction/coding of:
  - **female**: should be 1=female (paper’s negative β means females dislike *fewer* genres, given DV definition).
  - **age**: should be increasing with age (paper positive β).
  - **income per capita**: you likely computed or scaled it differently; but sign reversal usually indicates sample/coding issues.
- Make sure you are reporting **standardized betas** for all predictors in Model 2, not unstandardized b.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance): **wrong signs, wrong sizes, wrong constant**
**True β**
- Education **-0.151** ** (negative)
- Income pc **-0.009** (near zero, negative)
- Prestige **-0.022** (negative)
- Female **-0.095*** (negative)
- Age **0.110*** (positive)
- Southern **0.121** ** (positive)
- Political intolerance **0.164*** (positive)
- Constant **6.516**

**Generated betas**
- Education beta **-0.2836** (too large)
- Income beta **+0.2075** (**wrong sign**)
- Prestige beta **+0.5108** (**wrong sign, huge**)
- Female beta **+0.2063** (**wrong sign**)
- Age beta **+0.1477** (somewhat close sign-wise, too large)
- Southern beta **+0.2180** (too large)
- Political intolerance beta **0.3132** (too large)
- Constant **-7.185** (**wrong sign and wildly different**)

**Fix**
- Again: stop estimating on N=19. You cannot match Table 1 with that.
- Check **political intolerance** construction. Your `pol_intol` ranges up to 15 in the frame; ensure the paper’s scale and direction match (and that higher = more intolerance). Scale differences affect **unstandardized b**, but **β** should be comparable if computed correctly—so your β inflation signals the tiny-N issue more than scaling.
- Constant must be the **unstandardized intercept** from the unstandardized regression (not from standardized DV/IVs). If you standardized the DV, your intercept can shift drastically. Table 1’s constant is clearly on the original DV scale (≈6–11).

### 3) Variable names: mismatches + inconsistent labeling
**Generated internal names**
- `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `pol_intol`, `otherrace`

**True table labels**
- Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Political intolerance, Other race

**Problems**
- This is mostly cosmetic, *except* where your printed table has blank entries for Hispanic/Other race/No religion (because they were NaN). That becomes a substantive mismatch: the true model includes them with coefficients.

**Fix**
- Map names consistently *and* only display variables that were actually estimated.
- If you intend to match the paper, ensure categorical reference categories match the paper’s (race and religion especially). Different reference groups will change coefficients.

---

### 4) Standard errors: your output implies SE exist, but the true table does not report them
**True**
- Table 1 reports **β and stars only** (no SE). Your “Generated Results” also doesn’t show SE, but you are implicitly treating your estimates as directly comparable without matching the paper’s reporting choices.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to “match Table 1,” your output should include:
  - standardized β for predictors
  - unstandardized intercept
  - significance stars using the same thresholds
  - R²/Adj R², N
- Do **not** fabricate SE or claim SE mismatches. If you want SE, you must compute them from the model—but then you are no longer matching what Table 1 reports.

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches (direction/substantive meaning)
Given the true results:
- Education is consistently **negative** (more education → fewer genres disliked).
- Age is **positive** in Models 2–3 (older → more genres disliked).
- Female is **negative** in Models 2–3 (women → fewer genres disliked).
- Income and prestige are near zero to slightly negative once controls added.
- Political intolerance is **positive**.

Your generated Models 2–3 reverse key relationships (female positive, age negative in Model 2; prestige/income strongly positive), so any narrative based on the generated output would contradict the paper.

**Fix**
- Once you correct coding/listwise deletion and match N, re-check signs. If signs remain off:
  - Verify DV direction: is `num_genres_disliked` coded so higher = more disliked (matches paper)? If you accidentally used “liked” or inverted items, signs flip.
  - Verify dummy coding (0/1 meaning) for female, southern, etc.

---

### 6) The single biggest mechanical cause: your predictors are missing/constant → NaNs → tiny N
Evidence:
- In `raw_coef_tables`, Hispanic/Other race/No religion are **NaN** in Models 2–3.
- `missingness_diagnostics` shows extremely high missingness for some variables (e.g., one variable with **nonmissing 108** and **missing 1498**).
- This matches the collapse to **n=37** and **n=19**.

**Fix checklist (practical)**
1. **Audit missingness by variable with names** (your diagnostics table lacks variable names). Produce: variable, nonmissing, missing, %missing.
2. Ensure all categorical variables are coded from the raw GSS codes properly:
   - Convert “DON’T KNOW”, “NA”, “IAP”, “NOT ASKED” to missing consistently.
   - Recode race/ethnicity/religion into the exact categories the paper uses.
3. Build race and religion dummies so they are not all-missing and not perfectly collinear.
4. Refit models and confirm N targets:
   - Model 1 N≈787
   - Model 2 N≈756
   - Model 3 N≈503
5. Compute **standardized betas** on the estimation sample:
   - Either standardize X and Y then run OLS (intercept behavior differs), or compute β as `b * sd(X)/sd(Y)` from the unstandardized model. The latter keeps the intercept interpretable and is closer to “unstandardized constant + standardized slopes.”

If you paste the code you used to (a) construct `inc_pc`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, race dummies, and (b) compute betas, I can point to the exact line(s) causing the N collapse and the sign reversals.
