============================================================

Below is an item-by-item audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, covering **fit statistics, variable inclusion/names, coefficients (β), significance, and interpretation**—plus concrete fixes to make the generated analysis match the table.

---

## 1) Fit statistics / sample sizes: all three models mismatch

### Model 1 (SES)
- **n**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is too small. You’re likely doing listwise deletion using variables not in Model 1 (e.g., demographics or pol_intol) or applying extra filters. Recreate Model 1 using *only* the Model 1 variables and the dependent variable (num_genres_disliked) and drop missingness only on those.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, Adj = **0.085**
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, Adj = **0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample is corrected (n=787) and the coefficients are properly standardized (see §3), R² should move toward the reported values. Also verify you’re using OLS with an intercept and no weights (unless the paper used weights—Table 1 doesn’t indicate them).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **n**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** Massive over-deletion. You appear to be dropping cases due to missingness on variables not required, or due to a coding mistake that turns a category into NA (see “Hispanic” below). Ensure Model 2 uses listwise deletion on *only* Model 2 variables.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.136 / 0.118**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Correct sample and correct Hispanic coding; then recompute standardized coefficients.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **n**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Again, you’re losing far too many cases—likely from (a) treating pol_intol missing incorrectly, (b) unintentionally restricting the sample, and/or (c) Hispanic being NA for many records. Use only variables in Model 3 and ensure pol_intol is coded correctly.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.148 / 0.114**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Same as above plus ensure “Political intolerance” is scaled as in the paper (0–15) and correctly standardized before reporting β.

---

## 2) Variable presence / naming problems (including a critical “Hispanic = NA” error)

### (A) “Hispanic” is missing/NA in Models 2 and 3 (critical)
- Generated tables show **Hispanic blank** and in details: **b = NaN, beta = NaN, p = NaN**
- True Results include Hispanic with nonzero β:
  - Model 2: **Hispanic = -0.029**
  - Model 3: **Hispanic = 0.031**

**Likely causes**
1. **Perfect collinearity / dummy trap:** you may have included all race dummies (black, hispanic, otherrace) *plus* an intercept but also implicitly included “white” as a dummy somewhere, or coded race in a way that makes one column redundant.
2. **Hispanic coded as all missing** after recode (e.g., using wrong numeric codes).
3. **Hispanic has zero variance in the estimation subset** due to unintended filtering.

**Fix**
- Ensure a proper reference category:
  - If you have indicators `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, then **White is the omitted category** and you keep the intercept.
- Verify coding:
  - `hispanic` must be 0/1 with non-missing values for most respondents (your missingness table shows 35% missing, which is already high—still shouldn’t yield NaN unless coding/collinearity is broken).
- After fixing, Hispanic should produce finite estimates and appear in the table.

### (B) Variable labels differ from the paper
Not fatal, but you must ensure they map exactly:
- Generated DV: `num_genres_disliked` matches “Number of Music Genres Disliked” (OK).
- Generated predictors:
  - `educ_yrs` labeled “Education (years)” but paper says “Education” (fine if it’s the same construct).
  - `inc_pc` labeled “Household income per capita” (OK).
  - `prestg80_v` labeled “Occupational prestige” (OK).
  - `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south`, `female`, `age_v`, `black`, `otherrace`—fine if coded identically to the paper.

**Fix**
- Confirm coding matches the paper’s definitions (e.g., age in years; female=1; south=1; conservative protestant definition; “no religion” definition).

---

## 3) Coefficients (β) and significance stars: many mismatches

### Key point: Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**, but your pipeline mixes **b** and **β**
You do present `beta`, but the *Table1* columns appear to be those betas (good). However, the betas don’t match the paper’s betas, suggesting **standardization method and/or sample differs**.

Below are direct β mismatches (Generated vs True).

---

## 4) Model-by-model coefficient comparison (β)

### Model 1
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (minor) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | slightly high |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | mismatch |

**Fixes**
- Primary: correct **n** (787) and ensure standardization is done on the same estimation sample as the paper.
- Constant mismatch is expected if sample differs (and/or if your DV differs slightly due to recoding).

---

### Model 2
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.271*** | **-0.246*** | too large in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.056** | **-0.054** | close |
| Prestige | **-0.010** | **-0.006** | close-ish |
| Female | **-0.090***? | **-0.083***? | slightly off; also star mismatch (see below) |
| Age | **0.101***? | **0.140*** | **major** |
| Black | **0.044** | **0.029** | off |
| Hispanic | **missing/NA** | **-0.029** | **critical** |
| Other race | **-0.025** | **0.005** | wrong sign |
| Cons Prot | **0.070** | **0.059** | close |
| No religion | **-0.017** | **-0.012** | close |
| Southern | **0.062** | **0.097** | substantial |
| Constant | **9.767** | **8.507** | large mismatch |
| R² | **0.136** | **0.151** | mismatch |
| n | **507** | **756** | severe mismatch |

**Significance mismatches (Model 2)**
- True: Age is **0.140*** (p<.001); Generated: Age is only **0.101*** with p≈.021 (*), not ***.
- True: Southern is **0.097** ** (p<.01); Generated: Southern is nonsignificant (p≈.154).
- Generated shows Female p≈.035 (*), which matches “*”, but your top table prints “-0.090*” while the details show beta -0.0896, so that’s consistent internally—just not exactly the published β.

**Fixes**
1. Fix Hispanic estimation (collinearity/coding).
2. Fix the sample size (stop dropping to 507).
3. Ensure β are computed the same way:
   - Fit OLS on raw variables; then compute standardized coefficients using **SDs from the estimation sample**:
     \[
     \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
     \]
   - Do not standardize using the full dataset if the model uses a subset.

### Model 3
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.158***? | **-0.151** | close, but star differs |
| Income pc | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | **major** |
| Prestige | **-0.015** | **-0.022** | moderate |
| Female | **-0.127***? | **-0.095***? | too large magnitude |
| Age | **0.090 (ns)** | **0.110*** | mismatch (signif too) |
| Black | **0.088** | **0.049** | off |
| Hispanic | **NA** | **0.031** | **critical** |
| Other race | **0.054** | **0.053** | matches well |
| Cons Prot | **0.027** | **0.066** | big |
| No religion | **0.023** | **0.024** | matches |
| Southern | **0.071** | **0.121** | big |
| Political intolerance | **0.183** ** | **0.164*** | magnitude and stars mismatch |
| Constant | **7.692** | **6.516** | mismatch |
| R² | **0.148** | **0.169** | mismatch |
| n | **286** | **503** | severe mismatch |

**Fixes**
- Same core fixes: correct the estimation sample, correct Hispanic, and ensure pol_intol is coded/scaled correctly.
- Income per capita is wildly different (−0.052 vs −0.009): that usually signals **a different income variable**, different scaling, or different sample composition. Verify:
  - per-capita income construction (household income / household size?) matches the paper
  - any top-coding/logging used in the paper
  - whether the paper uses *family income* rather than per-capita income despite the label

---

## 5) Standard errors: you are reporting/using them when the table does not

- True Results: **SE not reported** in Table 1.
- Generated Results: You implicitly compute p-values from SEs and show significance stars.

**Mismatch type**
- Not a “wrong” computation, but it **cannot be presented as extracted Table 1 output**. If your goal is to “match the table,” you must suppress SE/p-values and ensure stars match the paper’s thresholds.

**Fix options**
1. **To match Table 1 exactly:** output only β (and constant) + stars using the paper’s stars (or your recomputed stars should match once the model/spec/sample matches).
2. **If you keep SE/p-values:** clearly label them as **your re-estimation from GSS**, not “extracted from Table 1.”

---

## 6) Interpretation mismatches implied by the generated output

### (A) “Dropped hispanic” in fit_stats
- Generated fit_stats says “dropped hispanic” for Models 2 and 3.
- In the paper, Hispanic is included and reported.

**Fix**
- Do not drop it; fix coding/collinearity so it is estimable.

### (B) Political intolerance scaling/label
- Generated label: “Political intolerance (0–15)” matches the paper’s range, but your coefficient differs and significance differs (** vs ***).

**Fix**
- Confirm the scale is exactly 0–15 and direction matches the paper’s index construction.
- Then fix sample selection (n should be 503) and recompute.

---

## 7) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Model-specific listwise deletion**
   - Model 1: complete cases on {DV, educ, inc_pc, prestige}
   - Model 2: complete cases on Model 1 vars + {female, age, black, hispanic, otherrace, cons_prot, norelig, south}
   - Model 3: complete cases on Model 2 vars + {pol_intol}

2. **Fix Hispanic**
   - Ensure it is a valid 0/1 indicator with enough non-missing cases.
   - Ensure the reference race category is omitted (usually White).
   - Remove any redundant race coding that induces perfect collinearity.

3. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way**
   - Estimate OLS with unstandardized variables.
   - Convert to β using SD ratios **within the estimation sample** for that model.

4. **Match the paper’s variable construction**
   - Confirm income is *per capita* and constructed identically.
   - Confirm occupational prestige variable matches (same scale/year).
   - Confirm political intolerance index construction.

5. **Match presentation**
   - Table 1: report **β only**, constants unstandardized, stars using the paper thresholds.
   - Don’t show SEs as if they came from Table 1.

If you share your code (or at least: how you recoded race/ethnicity, how you built inc_pc and pol_intol, and how you selected complete cases), I can pinpoint exactly why **n collapses** and why **Hispanic becomes NaN** in your specific pipeline.
