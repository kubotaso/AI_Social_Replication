### 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches

**A. DV label mismatch**
- **Generated**: Model 3 is titled “Political intolerance” (looks like the DV changed).
- **True**: DV is **always** “Number of music genres disliked”; *political intolerance is an added predictor* in Model 3.
- **Fix**: Retitle Model 3 to something like **“Model 3 (Political Intolerance predictor)”** or “Full model + political intolerance,” and keep the DV label constant across models.

**B. Income variable naming ambiguity**
- **Generated term**: `income_pc`
- **True table label**: “Household income per capita”
- This may be the same construct, but your output should match the printed name.
- **Fix**: Relabel `income_pc` in the table to **Household income per capita** (or rename before tabulation).

**C. Prestige variable naming**
- **Generated term**: `prestg80`
- **True label**: “Occupational prestige”
- **Fix**: Relabel `prestg80` to **Occupational prestige** in the final table.

*(Other predictors’ labels appear consistent conceptually: female, age, black, hispanic, other_race, conservative_protestant, no_religion, southern, political_intolerance.)*

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **all coefficient mismatches** between Generated and True Table 1 betas (standardized).

#### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332*** | -0.322*** | value differs |

| R² | 0.157 | 0.151 | differs |
| Adj. R² | 0.139 | 0.139 | matches (close enough, but still check rounding) |
| N | 523 | 756 | **major mismatch** |

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance model)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.157* | -0.151** | stars mismatch (and slight value) |
| Household income per capita | -0.067 | -0.009 | **large mismatch** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | differs |
| Female | -0.118* | -0.095* | differs |
| Age | 0.092 | 0.110* | value + significance mismatch |
| Black | 0.004 | 0.049 | differs |
| Hispanic | 0.091 | 0.031 | differs |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | **matches** |
| Conservative Protestant | -0.011 | 0.066 | sign mismatch |
| No religion | 0.018 | 0.024 | differs |
| Southern | 0.073 | 0.121** | **large mismatch + stars** |
| Political intolerance | 0.196** | 0.164*** | value + significance mismatch |
| Constant | 7.583 | 6.516 | differs |
| R² | 0.152 | 0.169 | differs |
| Adj. R² | 0.115 | 0.148 | differs |
| N | 293 | 503 | **major mismatch** |

**Bottom line:** This isn’t just rounding error. Your estimation sample, standardization choices, and/or variable construction do not match the published analysis.

### 3) Standard errors: incorrect to display (and currently missing anyway)

- **True**: Table 1 **does not report standard errors** at all (standardized betas only).
- **Generated**: Your `table1_style` also doesn’t actually show SEs, but the prompt says to check “standard errors.” There are none to compare.
- **Fix**:
  1. If you want to match the PDF table: **do not add SE rows/parentheses**.
  2. If you must show SEs for your own appendix: compute them, but label clearly “not in published table.”

---

### 4) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Because stars depend on p-values, and your coefficients differ, several star codes are wrong relative to the printed table. Examples:
- **Model 2 age**: Generated `0.109*` vs True `0.140***`
- **Model 2 southern**: Generated no stars vs True `0.097**`
- **Model 3 political intolerance**: Generated `**` vs True `***`
- **Model 3 education**: Generated `*` vs True `**`

**Fix**: Once you replicate (a) the same sample and (b) the same model specification and (c) the same standardization procedure, recompute p-values and apply **exactly the same star thresholds** as the paper (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001). Right now the star mismatches are downstream of the deeper replication failure.

---

### 5) The biggest problem: your N’s (and therefore everything else) don’t match

**True N**: 787 / 756 / 503  
**Generated N**: 758 / 523 / 293

These are not minor differences; they indicate you are fitting the models on a substantially more restricted subset—especially Models 2 and 3.

Your own missingness tables show why:
- `hispanic` missing = 281 (huge)
- `political_intolerance` missing = 402 (huge)

This implies your coded variables likely treat a lot of valid responses as missing (or you used an overly strict inclusion rule).

**Fixes to align N with the paper:**
1. **Recreate variables using the paper’s coding rules**, especially:
   - `hispanic` (and race dummies generally): don’t set to NA unless truly missing; ensure the reference category and coding match the paper.
   - `political_intolerance`: the paper’s scale construction likely includes specific items and allowable missing; your “strict15” nonmissing flag suggests you required too many non-missing items.
2. **Use the same wave/year restrictions** as the paper (you reference `N_year_1993=1606` and `N_complete_music_18=893`; ensure the paper’s analytic sample is the same base).
3. **Match listwise deletion rules**:
   - The paper’s Ns imply *less* deletion than yours—so either:
     - they used less strict scale construction (e.g., mean of items with partial completion), and/or
     - they recoded “don’t know/refused” differently, and/or
     - they used imputation (less likely given the table style, but possible).
4. **Audit each variable’s valid codes**:
   - Print frequency tables *before* recoding.
   - Confirm which codes represent missing (often 8/9, 98/99, etc. in survey data).
   - Ensure you didn’t accidentally treat legitimate values (e.g., 0) as missing.

Until N matches, coefficient matching is basically impossible.

### 6) Standardization procedure likely doesn’t match the paper

The true table reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. Your `beta_std` may not be computed the same way the authors did.

Common replication pitfalls:
- Standardizing using the **model’s estimation sample** vs standardizing using a broader sample
- Standardizing only X’s vs standardizing both X and Y (beta = b * sd(X)/sd(Y))
- Using survey weights vs unweighted (weights change SDs and coefficients if you run weighted OLS)

**Fix**:
- Compute standardized betas exactly as in the paper:
  - Fit the **unstandardized** OLS on the correct sample (and weights, if used).
  - Convert to standardized: \(\beta_j = b_j \times \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}\), with SDs computed on the **same analytic sample** (and weighted if the model is weighted).
- Alternatively, standardize Y and all X **then refit OLS** on standardized variables; this matches the beta formula if done consistently.

---

### 7) Model constants don’t line up (expected if you standardized differently)

In a model where variables are standardized (especially if Y is standardized), the constant changes drastically (often near 0 if Y is standardized). But the paper shows constants around 10.920, 8.507, 6.516—suggesting:
- The DV is **not standardized** in the printed “standardized coefficients” table (common: they standardize only coefficients, not the raw DV in the regression output they used for the constant), or
- They report standardized betas **but keep the unstandardized intercept** from the original model.

Your constants are consistently too high (11.086 vs 10.920; 10.089 vs 8.507; 7.583 vs 6.516), again pointing to sample/coding differences and possibly specification differences.

**Fix**:
- Replicate their workflow: run the raw OLS (DV in original units), then compute standardized betas separately, while reporting the **raw intercept** from the unstandardized model.

---

### 8) Specific sign mismatches indicate dummy/reference-category miscoding

Some differences are small, but these are qualitatively alarming:
- Model 2 **Other race**: Generated -0.016 vs True +0.005 (sign flip)
- Model 3 **Conservative Protestant**: Generated -0.011 vs True +0.066 (sign flip)

Sign flips often come from:
- wrong reference category (e.g., coding 1 = NOT other race)
- mixing mutually exclusive race categories incorrectly (not enforcing one-hot encoding)
- coding “conservative_protestant” as “non–conservative protestant” by mistake

**Fix**:
- Verify dummy construction:
  - `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` should be mutually exclusive and compared to a clear omitted category (likely white non-Hispanic).
  - `conservative_protestant` should be 1 only for that group, 0 for all others (including other religions).
- Cross-tab dummies vs original religion/race variables to ensure correctness.

## What to do to make the generated analysis match the true table (minimal checklist)

1. **Rebuild analytic samples to match N exactly**: 787 (M1), 756 (M2), 503 (M3).  
2. **Recode missing values correctly** (especially `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` scale construction).  
3. **Confirm model specs** match exactly (same covariates, same omitted categories).  
4. **Match weighting and design choices** (unweighted vs weighted).  
5. **Compute standardized betas the same way the paper did**, and **report only betas (no SEs)** in the main table.  
6. **Regenerate stars** using the paper’s thresholds after replication is correct.  
7. **Relabel terms** to match the printed Table 1 names and fix the misleading Model 3 title.

If you share the code you used to construct `political_intolerance`, `hispanic`, and the race/religion dummies (plus whether you used weights), I can pinpoint exactly which recodes are collapsing N from 503 to 293 and from 756 to 523.
