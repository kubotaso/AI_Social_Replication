============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: n, R², adj. R² all mismatch (and the direction suggests different samples/models)

**Generated vs True**

- **Model 1**
  - **n:** 747 vs **787** (true)
  - **R²:** 0.088 vs **0.107**
  - **Adj R²:** 0.085 vs **0.104**
- **Model 2**
  - **n:** 507 vs **756**
  - **R²:** 0.135 vs **0.151**
  - **Adj R²:** 0.118 vs **0.139**
- **Model 3**
  - **n:** 286 vs **503**
  - **R²:** 0.145 vs **0.169**
  - **Adj R²:** 0.111 vs **0.148**

**Likely cause**
- You ran models on **different (much smaller) complete-case samples**, likely due to:
  - listwise deletion compounded by coding missing race dummies incorrectly (see “Other race” issue below),
  - plus political intolerance missingness (47%) shrinking Model 3 heavily,
  - and possibly additional unintended missingness introduced during recodes/merges.

**Fix**
- Reproduce the paper’s sample restrictions and missing-data handling exactly.
  - Ensure you’re using **GSS 1993 only** and the same eligibility restrictions the paper used.
  - Verify that the dependent variable and each covariate is coded so that missing values match the paper.
- Then confirm N per model *before* fitting:
  - `model.frame()` (R) / `df[vars].dropna()` (Python) counts should match **787 / 756 / 503**.
- If the paper used **pairwise deletion** or some other handling (less common in regression tables, but possible), you must match that. Your results look like strict listwise deletion with additional accidental missingness.

---

### 2) Variable name/coding discrepancy: “Other race” is dropped/NaN in generated output but exists in true table

**Generated**
- Model 2 and 3: `Other race` is **NaN** and `fit_stats` shows `dropped otherrace`.

**True**
- Model 2: **Other race β = 0.005**
- Model 3: **Other race β = 0.053**

**Likely cause**
- Perfect collinearity or zero-variance dummy due to incorrect dummy construction. Common mistakes:
  1. Creating race dummies that sum to 1 **including the reference** plus intercept (dummy variable trap).
  2. Coding race categories so that “otherrace” is always missing or always 0 in the estimation subset.
  3. Filtering the data so that no “other race” cases remain (or only one category remains), making the dummy non-estimable.

**Fix**
- Recreate race categories so exactly one is the omitted reference group.
  - Example: include **Black, Hispanic, Other race** and omit **White** (or whatever the paper uses).
- Ensure the “other race” dummy is 1 for the correct respondents and not set to NA accidentally.
- After coding, check:
  - frequency table of race categories within each model’s estimation sample,
  - variance of each dummy (must be > 0),
  - design matrix rank (no perfect collinearity).

### 3) Coefficients (standardized βs) mismatch across many predictors

The “true” Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**. Your `table1` appears to be trying to report β, but multiple βs differ meaningfully.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292 | **-0.322** | yes |
| Income pc | -0.039 | **-0.037** | slight |
| Prestige | 0.020 | **0.016** | slight |
| Constant | 10.638 | **10.920** | yes |
| R² | 0.088 | **0.107** | yes |
| n | 747 | **787** | yes |

**Fix**
- Same as sample restriction/missingness fix: if you match the paper’s estimation sample and coding, βs and constant should move toward the reported values.
- Also verify you are standardizing the **same way**:
  - The table’s β typically equals coefficient from a regression where predictors and outcome are standardized (or computed post hoc as \(b \cdot sd(x)/sd(y)\)).  
  - If you standardize using the wrong SDs (e.g., full sample SDs instead of the model sample SDs), β will differ.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

Key mismatches:

| Term | Generated β | True β |
|---|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.264 | **-0.246** |
| Prestige | -0.016 | **-0.006** |
| Female | -0.090 | **-0.083** |
| Age | 0.104* | **0.140*** |
| Black | 0.043 | **0.029** |
| Hispanic | 0.030 | **-0.029** (sign flips) |
| Other race | dropped | **0.005** |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.090 | **0.059** |
| Southern | 0.063 | **0.097** |
| Constant | 9.285 | **8.507** |

**Interpretation mismatch:** Your table marks **Age** as only `*`, but true is `***`. Southern is nonsignificant in yours but `**` in true.

**Fix**
1. **Get the same N (756)**; age and southern differences are often very sensitive to who is included.
2. **Hispanic sign flip** strongly suggests a coding issue:
   - Hispanic dummy may be reversed (1=non-Hispanic) or reference category differs.
   - Or race/ethnicity constructed inconsistently with the paper (e.g., Hispanics excluded from race dummies in one approach but not the other).
   - Fix by reproducing the paper’s exact coding rules for Black/Hispanic/Other race (mutually exclusive categories are typical in such tables).
3. Ensure **Other race** is included properly (see Section 2).
4. Standardize using **the estimation sample** SDs.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | Generated β | True β |
|---|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.157* | **-0.151** (**) |
| Income pc | -0.050 | **-0.009** (big mismatch) |
| Prestige | -0.011 | **-0.022** |
| Female | -0.122* | **-0.095***? (* in true) |
| Age | 0.083 (ns) | **0.110***? (* in true) |
| Black | 0.107 | **0.049** |
| Other race | dropped | **0.053** |
| Cons Prot | 0.037 | **0.066** |
| Southern | 0.065 | **0.121** |
| Political intolerance | 0.190** | **0.164*** |
| Constant | 7.360 | **6.516** |
| n | 286 | **503** |
| R² | 0.145 | **0.169** |

**Fix**
- The **massive N drop** (286 vs 503) is the main driver. Your Model 3 appears to be fit on an overly restricted subset—likely because:
  - political intolerance is missing for many (expected), **plus** you are also losing cases due to the `otherrace` construction and possibly other recodes.
- **Income pc β** being far off (−0.050 vs −0.009) is consistent with using a biased/selected subsample or incorrect scaling (e.g., income per capita computed differently).
  - Verify the income-per-capita construction matches the paper (equivalization, household size, top-coding, inflation adjustments if any).
- Political intolerance significance: you have `**` (p=.00265) while true shows `***`—again consistent with different N/sample/SEs.

---

### 4) Standard errors: generated output includes SE/p-values but the “true” table explicitly does not report SE

**Mismatch**
- Your “generated analysis” is presenting p-values and significance from your replication, while the “true results” are **extracted table entries** with **no SEs** reported.

**Fix (presentation)**
- If the goal is to match Table 1 *as printed*, remove SE columns and don’t claim the paper’s SEs.
- If the goal is to replicate and *then* add SEs, label them clearly as “replication SEs,” not “from Table 1.”

---

### 5) Interpretation/significance-star mismatches (important for substantive conclusions)

Examples:
- **Age**: generated Model 2 `*` but true `***` → changes inference about cohort/life-cycle pattern.
- **Southern**: generated mostly nonsignificant, true is `**` in Models 2 and 3 → regional differences are understated.
- **Education**: star level differs in Model 3 (generated `*`, true `**`) → education effect weaker in your version.
- **Political intolerance**: generated `**`, true `***` → your model implies weaker evidence than reported.

**Fix**
- These will resolve once you match:
  1. **sample** (N),
  2. **coding** (especially race/ethnicity and income pc),
  3. **standardization method** (model-sample SDs),
  4. and any **weights** (see next point).

---

### 6) Weights: generated output shows no weight used, but the paper may have weighted (unclear from excerpt)

**Generated**
- `weight_used` is blank.

**True**
- Not stated here whether weights were used. Many GSS analyses use weights depending on design/year.

**Fix**
- Check the paper’s methods: if it used a GSS weight (e.g., WTSSALL or year-specific), you must apply it.
- Note: using weights will change coefficients slightly and can change significance.

---

### 7) Internal inconsistency in the generated output: “dropped otherrace” but race missingness is huge and equal across black/hispanic/otherrace

**Generated missingness**
- black/hispanic/otherrace each missing 562 (35%). That symmetry suggests these were likely derived from a single race variable—fine—but it also suggests you may have set all three to missing together, possibly too aggressively.

**Fix**
- Ensure you’re only setting race dummies to missing when race is missing, not when someone is White (which should be 0s, not NAs).
- White should typically imply: black=0, hispanic=0, otherrace=0 (if White is reference), **not NA**.

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1. **Rebuild the estimation samples** to hit the paper’s N:
   - Model 1: 787
   - Model 2: 756
   - Model 3: 503  
   Do this by aligning year filter, variable recodes, and missingness rules.

2. **Fix race/ethnicity coding**:
   - Make categories mutually exclusive and consistent with the paper.
   - Include `otherrace` correctly so it is estimable (not collinear, not all-missing).

3. **Verify income-per-capita construction** matches exactly (household size, coding of income, any transformations/top-coding).

4. **Compute standardized coefficients (β) the same way as the paper**:
   - Use model-sample SDs.
   - Confirm whether y is also standardized for β reporting (typical for standardized regression coefficients).

5. **Match weighting (if used)** and the same OLS specification (intercept, no extra controls, no robust SE unless paper did).

If you share (a) your code for constructing `num_genres_disliked`, `inc_pc`, and race/ethnicity, and (b) the exact GSS variables used, I can pinpoint which specific recode/filter is responsible for the N collapses and the Hispanic sign flip.
