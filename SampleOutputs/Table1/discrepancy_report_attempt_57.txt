Score: 31/100
============================================================

Below is every discrepancy between the **generated output** and the **true (paper/Table 1) results**, grouped by (a) model fit/case counts, (b) variable presence/names, (c) coefficients (β) and constants, (d) standard errors / p-values / stars, and (e) interpretation. For each, I state exactly how to fix the generated analysis so it matches the true Table 1.

---

## 1) Model fit statistics and N: all three models mismatch

### Model 1
- **Generated:** n = **747**, R² = **0.088**, adj. R² = **0.085**
- **True:** n = **787**, R² = **0.107**, adj. R² = **0.104**
- **Fix:** Your analytic sample construction is not reproducing Table 1.
  - Use the **same year/subsample and weighting rules** as the paper (here: GSS 1993; Table 1’s N implies different missing-data handling than your model frame).
  - Apply **listwise deletion on the exact variables in each model** (and only those variables) *after* restricting to the paper’s target sample.
  - Ensure the dependent variable is exactly **“Number of music genres disliked”** (the paper’s DV), coded identically.

### Model 2
- **Generated:** n = **507**, R² = **0.135**, adj. R² = **0.118**
- **True:** n = **756**, R² = **0.151**, adj. R² = **0.139**
- **Fix:** same issue, but more severe. You are dropping far more cases than Table 1.
  - Your “missingness” table shows race dummies have ~35% missing; that is inconsistent with typical GSS race items (often near-complete). This suggests **you constructed race variables from a field that is missing for many cases**, or you restricted to a subgroup unintentionally.
  - Rebuild race/ethnicity from the correct GSS variables and confirm non-missing rates match expectations and Table 1’s N.

### Model 3
- **Generated:** n = **286**, R² = **0.145**, adj. R² = **0.111**
- **True:** n = **503**, R² = **0.169**, adj. R² = **0.148**
- **Fix:** your **political intolerance** variable is causing huge attrition (you report ~47% missing). Table 1’s Model 3 keeps 503 cases, so your pol_intol construction is not matching the paper’s.
  - Recreate the political intolerance scale exactly as the paper does (items included, coding direction, allowable “don’t know/refused” handling, and whether the scale is averaged vs summed).
  - Verify the final scale range and missingness align with the paper’s procedure.

## 2) Variable name / inclusion mismatches (including a critical “Other race” failure)

### “Other race” is broken in generated models 2 and 3
- **Generated:** “Other race” coefficient is **NaN**, and `fit_stats` says **dropped = otherrace**
- **True:** “Other race” is included with nonzero β:
  - Model 2: **0.005**
  - Model 3: **0.053**
- **What this means:** Your design matrix likely has **perfect collinearity** (dummy trap), a **zero-variance dummy**, or all “otherrace” values are missing in the model frame.
- **Fix:**
  1. If you use race dummies (Black, Hispanic, Other), ensure the **reference category is White** and you include **k−1** dummies, not all categories plus an intercept.
  2. Ensure “Other race” is coded 0/1 correctly and is not all NA after filtering.
  3. Don’t create “black/hispanic/otherrace” from an already-missing composite; use the correct GSS race/ethnicity fields and recode consistently.

### DV naming mismatch (likely)
- **Generated:** appears to model something like `num_genres_disliked` but the tables label “Political intolerance (0–15)” etc.
- **True:** DV is **Number of Music Genres Disliked**.
- **Fix:** Ensure the DV in the regression is exactly the paper’s constructed DV (same items, same exclusions, same year). A DV mismatch alone will shift *all* coefficients/R².

---

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches: Model-by-model

Important: The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors, but **constants are unstandardized**. Your “Table1style” outputs look like βs for predictors and unstandardized constants—good in principle—but the values do not match the true βs.

### Model 1 (SES)
**True βs:** Education **-0.322***; Income **-0.037**; Prestige **0.016**; Constant **10.920**  
**Generated βs (Table1style):** Education **-0.292***; Income **-0.039**; Prestige **0.020**; Constant **10.638**

Mismatches:
- Education: **-0.292 vs -0.322** (too small in magnitude)
- Prestige: **0.020 vs 0.016**
- Constant: **10.638 vs 10.920**
- R²/adj R², N (already noted)

**Fix:** Once sample and coding match Table 1, recompute **standardized β** the same way the paper does (typically: standardize X and Y, or compute β from unstandardized b using SD ratios). If you’re standardizing differently than the paper, βs will differ even if b’s are “right.”

### Model 2 (Demographic)
**True βs:**  
Education -0.246***; Income -0.054; Prestige -0.006; Female -0.083*; Age 0.140***; Black 0.029; Hispanic -0.029; Other race 0.005; Cons Prot 0.059; No religion -0.012; Southern 0.097**; Constant 8.507

**Generated βs:**  
Education -0.264*** (too negative), Income -0.053 (close), Prestige -0.016 (too negative), Female -0.090* (too negative), Age 0.104* (**far too small** and wrong stars), Black 0.043 (higher), Hispanic 0.030 (**wrong sign**), Other race missing/blank (NaN), Cons Prot 0.090 (too high), No religion -0.019 (too negative), Southern 0.063 (**too small** and wrong stars), Constant 9.285 (**too high**)

**Fixes:**
1. **Hispanic sign error:** Your Hispanic dummy is likely coded backwards (e.g., 1 = non-Hispanic) or you used a different base group.
   - Recode so Hispanic=1 for Hispanic respondents, 0 otherwise, with White non-Hispanic as reference (or whatever the paper uses—Table 1 implies a White reference with separate dummies).
2. **Age effect and Southern effect are too small:** indicates either:
   - wrong sample; or
   - age coded/scaled differently (e.g., centered, capped, or in decades).
   - Fix: match age coding (years, not categories; no rescaling unless paper did).
3. **Constant mismatch (9.285 vs 8.507):** consistent with overall sample/coding mismatch and/or different centering/standardization approach for predictors.
4. **Other race missing:** fix dummy coding/collinearity as in section 2.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
**True βs:**  
Education -0.151**; Income -0.009; Prestige -0.022; Female -0.095*; Age 0.110*; Black 0.049; Hispanic 0.031; Other race 0.053; Cons Prot 0.066; No religion 0.024; Southern 0.121**; Political intolerance 0.164***; Constant 6.516

**Generated βs:**  
Education -0.157* (star level differs), Income -0.050 (**way too negative**), Prestige -0.011 (too small magnitude), Female -0.122* (too negative), Age 0.083 (too small, and loses star), Black 0.107 (too high), Hispanic 0.028 (close), Other race missing, Cons Prot 0.037 (too small), No religion 0.024 (matches), Southern 0.065 (too small), Political intolerance 0.190** (too high and wrong stars), Constant 7.360 (too high)

**Fixes:**
1. **Political intolerance β and missingness:** Your intolerance scale construction is not matching the paper (both β and N are off).
   - Rebuild scale exactly; confirm range is 0–15 as labeled *and* that the paper’s scale is actually that same operationalization (your label may match, but your item handling likely doesn’t).
2. **Income β is drastically wrong (-0.050 vs -0.009):** suggests income per capita variable differs from paper (different denominator, transformation, trimming, or units).
   - Fix: match the paper’s “household income per capita” creation (equivalence scale? household size? inflation adjustment? category-to-midpoint conversion?).
3. **Southern β too small:** again points to sample mismatch and/or region coding mismatch (e.g., South defined incorrectly).
4. **Education stars:** True is ** (p<.01) whereas you show * (p<.05). This is a direct consequence of wrong sample/model variance (and you’re using p-values while Table 1 uses stars without SEs shown).

---

## 4) Standard errors and p-values: generated output is not comparable to Table 1

- **Generated:** reports p-values and significance based on your estimated SEs.
- **True:** Table 1 reports **β and stars only**; **SEs are not reported**.

This creates two problems:
1. You cannot “validate” your SEs against Table 1 because Table 1 doesn’t include them.
2. Your stars are not matching the paper’s stars in multiple places (Age, Education in Model 3, Southern, Political intolerance), which indicates your underlying estimates/sample differ.

**Fix:**
- If your goal is to match Table 1, output **only standardized β and stars** using the same thresholds (*, **, ***).  
- But the real fix is upstream: once the sample and variables match, your p-values/stars should line up much more closely. If they still don’t, check whether the paper uses:
  - **weights**,  
  - **robust SEs**,  
  - **design-based SEs** (complex survey), or  
  - slightly different df assumptions.

## 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by the generated results

### Wrong substantive direction for Hispanic in Model 2
- **Generated implies:** Hispanic increases number of genres disliked (β ≈ +0.030)
- **True:** Hispanic decreases it (β = **-0.029**)
- **Fix:** recode Hispanic dummy/reference category correctly (see above). Do not interpret until sign matches.

### Overstating income importance in Model 3
- **Generated:** income β ≈ -0.050 (moderate negative)
- **True:** income β = -0.009 (near zero)
- **Fix:** rebuild income per capita; don’t interpret income as meaningful in Model 3 until the construction matches.

### Political intolerance effect size/star level
- **Generated:** β = 0.190**  
- **True:** β = 0.164***  
- **Fix:** correct intolerance scale + sample/SE method; then interpret as in paper (positive and statistically strong).

---

## 6) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Restrict to GSS 1993** and the same universe as the paper (same age range, exclusions, etc.).
2. **Reconstruct DV** (“number of music genres disliked”) exactly as paper.
3. **Reconstruct key composites** exactly:
   - political intolerance scale (items, coding, missing rules),
   - household income per capita (units, equivalization, trimming).
4. **Recode demographics** to match paper:
   - Female (0/1),
   - Age in years (no rescaling unless paper did),
   - Race/ethnicity dummies with correct reference (avoid dummy trap),
   - South definition consistent with GSS/census region used by paper,
   - Conservative Protestant / No religion definitions.
5. **Match estimation details:**
   - OLS,
   - apply the same **weights** (if the paper used any),
   - compute **standardized β** the same way as paper.
6. **Use model-wise listwise deletion** that reproduces Table 1’s Ns (787, 756, 503). If your N differs, do not proceed—find which variable construction is creating extra missingness.

If you share (a) the code used to build **pol_intol**, **inc_pc**, and the race/ethnicity dummies, plus (b) the exact filtering steps before each model, I can pinpoint exactly which line(s) are producing the N collapse and the sign/β discrepancies.
