### 1) Fit statistics and sample sizes (major mismatches)

**Mismatch: n differs in every model**
- Generated: Model 1 **n=747**, Model 2 **n=271**, Model 3 **n=45**
- True: Model 1 **n=787**, Model 2 **n=756**, Model 3 **n=503**

**Why it matters**
- Your coefficients/p-values and even which variables can be estimated depend on the analytic sample. With n=45, Model 3 is clearly being run on an extremely restricted subset (likely listwise deletion with a very sparse variable).

**How to fix**
- Recreate the *paper’s* estimation sample. The true table is from **GSS 1993** and Table 1 uses much larger n than your “complete case” models.
- Concretely:
  - Filter to **GSS 1993 only** (if you didn’t).
  - Verify you are using the **same dependent variable construction** (“number of music genres disliked”) and the same missing-data rules as the paper.
  - Avoid accidental listwise deletion across variables not used in that model.
  - Check coding of `pol_intol`: your missingness table shows **80% missing**, which would crush Model 3 if you do listwise deletion.

**Mismatch: R² / Adjusted R²**
- Model 1: Generated **R²=0.088** (true **0.107**), adj R²=0.085 (true **0.104**)
- Model 2: Generated **R²=0.152** ~close to true **0.151**, but adj R² way off: **0.120** vs **0.139** (driven by wrong n and possibly wrong k)
- Model 3: Generated **R²=0.325** vs true **0.169**; adj R² **0.101** vs true **0.148** (again driven by n=45 and different model)

**How to fix**
- Once the **correct n** is restored and the model specification matches, R² should come into line.
- Ensure you’re computing **standard OLS R²** (not weighted, not robust pseudo-R², not something from standardized variables only).

### 2) Variable name / content mismatches

**Mismatch: “Political intolerance (0–15)” sign and interpretation**
- Generated β: **−0.023** (p=0.891; essentially null and negative)
- True β: **+0.164*** (positive and highly significant)

**What this indicates**
- You are almost certainly **not using the same variable**, **not coding it the same direction**, and/or using a tiny nonrepresentative subset (n=45) where the relationship disappears.

**How to fix**
- Confirm the political intolerance scale:
  - Same items, same scoring, same range (0–15).
  - Same direction (higher = more intolerance). If you reversed it, the sign flips.
- Fix missingness:
  - Your `pol_intol` nonmissing is 320 out of 1606 (80% missing). The paper’s Model 3 has **n=503**, so you’re either missing cases you should have or using a different construction that creates more missing.
  - Rebuild `pol_intol` exactly as in the paper (e.g., sum score with specific allowable missing rules if they used them), rather than requiring all component items present.

**Mismatch: “No religion”**
- Generated shows **No religion = 0.000000 / NaN p-values** in Models 2 and 3.
- True has nonzero coefficients:
  - Model 2: **−0.012**
  - Model 3: **+0.024**

**What this indicates**
- The `norelig` variable is likely **constant** in your estimation sample (or perfectly collinear with the intercept/other dummies), hence the 0/NaN behavior.

**How to fix**
- Re-check dummy coding:
  - Make sure “No religion” is not the **reference category** while also included as a dummy (dummy trap).
  - Ensure your religion dummies correspond to the same baseline as the paper.
- Check that after filtering and missing handling, `norelig` still varies.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas β in Table 1)

Important: the paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)**, not unstandardized slopes. Your “Table1” columns appear to use your computed `beta`, so that’s the right target—but the values don’t match.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **−0.292*** | **−0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **−0.039** | **−0.037** | close |
| Prestige | **+0.020** | **+0.016** | slightly high |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | off |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | off |
| n | **747** | **787** | off |

**Fix**
- Correct sample definition (n) and constant/scale of DV.
- Ensure DV matches exactly (“number of music genres disliked”): if you used `num_genres_disliked` but with different genre set, coding, or missing rules, both constant and coefficients shift.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

Large discrepancies:

| Term | Generated β | True β | Direction/size issues |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **−0.284*** | **−0.246*** | too negative |
| Income pc | **−0.021** | **−0.054** | far too small |
| Prestige | **+0.011** | **−0.006** | sign mismatch |
| Female | **−0.080** (ns) | **−0.083*** (* in true) | sig mismatch (likely n/SE issue) |
| Age | **+0.085** (ns) | **+0.140*** | too small; sig mismatch |
| Black | **+0.113** | **+0.029** | far too large |
| Hispanic | **−0.040** | **−0.029** | close-ish |
| Other race | **−0.000** | **+0.005** | sign mismatch (tiny though) |
| Cons Prot | **+0.107** | **+0.059** | too large |
| No religion | blank/undefined | **−0.012** | estimation failure |
| Southern | **+0.123*** | **+0.097** ** | magnitude and star mismatch |
| Constant | **9.492** | **8.507** | off |
| adj R² | **0.120** | **0.139** | off |
| n | **271** | **756** | catastrophic mismatch |

**Fix**
- The Model 2 sample must be wrong (n=271). This alone explains many sig differences.
- Rebuild race/religion region coding to match the paper’s categories and baseline.
- Ensure you are standardizing the same way:
  - Standardized beta in OLS: `β = b * SD(x) / SD(y)` on the estimation sample.
  - If you standardized variables globally before subsetting, or used a different y, your β will differ.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

Nearly everything deviates, and the key predictor has opposite sign.

| Term | Generated β | True β |
|---|---:|---:|
| Education | −0.269 | **−0.151** ** |
| Female | −0.019 | **−0.095** * |
| Age | −0.018 | **+0.110** * (sign mismatch) |
| Hispanic | −0.195 | **+0.031** (sign mismatch) |
| Southern | +0.216 | **+0.121** ** |
| Political intolerance | **−0.023** | **+0.164** *** |
| Constant | 12.103 | 6.516 |
| R² | 0.325 | 0.169 |
| n | 45 | 503 |

**Fix**
- This model is not comparable at all as currently estimated.
- Main repairs:
  1. Reconstruct `pol_intol` and its missingness to get n≈503.
  2. Confirm the **direction** of intolerance.
  3. Confirm you’re still predicting the same DV (genres disliked) and not a subset outcome.
  4. Ensure age is coded correctly (your negative age β suggests either miscoding or sample artifact).

### 4) Standard errors and interpretation mismatches

**Mismatch: You report SE/p-values; the true Table 1 does not report SE**
- True results explicitly: **SE not reported**, only stars, and coefficients are **standardized β** (constants unstandardized).

**Why it matters**
- Your significance stars are being generated from your own p-values, but since your sample/specification is off, the star pattern doesn’t match the paper.

**How to fix**
- To “match the table,” don’t try to match SEs (they’re not provided). Match:
  - the **standardized β values**, constants, R²/adj R², and n
  - and then apply stars using the paper’s thresholds (or compute p-values only after you’ve replicated their model exactly).
- If you must show SE, label them as “not in original table” and don’t claim equivalence.

---

### 5) Specific technical red flags in the generated output (and fixes)

1) **`No religion` shows NaN / exactly 0**
- Fix dummy trap / collinearity; verify it varies; set a baseline category and omit it.

2) **Model 3 has n=45 despite 320 nonmissing pol_intol**
- That implies additional variables are driving deletion (or you filtered incorrectly).
- Fix by computing the analytic dataset *per model* using only variables in that model, and check which variable is causing deletion.

3) **Constants are far from true**
- Often indicates DV construction mismatch (different count of genres, different coding of “disliked,” different handling of DK/NA).
- Fix by replicating DV coding rules from the paper exactly.

---

### 6) What the generated analysis must change to match the true Table 1

To make your generated analysis match, you need all of the following:

1) **Use the correct GSS 1993 sample and weights (if the paper used weights).**
2) **Recreate the dependent variable exactly** (same set of genres, same response coding, same missing handling).
3) **Recreate each independent variable exactly** (especially `pol_intol`, religion, race, region).
4) **Match the paper’s missing-data approach** so that n aligns: 787 / 756 / 503.
5) **Compute standardized coefficients β the same way** on the final estimation sample for each model.
6) **Do not include “No religion” dummy if it is the reference**, and ensure one category per factor is omitted.

If you share the code (or at least the variable construction rules you used for `num_genres_disliked` and `pol_intol`, plus how you built race/religion dummies and what you used as baselines), I can pinpoint exactly which recodes are causing the biggest sign/magnitude reversals (especially political intolerance, age, and prestige).
