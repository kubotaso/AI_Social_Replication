Score: 37/100
============================================================

Below is a term-by-term audit of **every mismatch** between the *Generated Results* and the *True Results* (Table 1), covering **variable names, coefficients, standard errors, fit stats, Ns, and interpretation/significance**—plus **what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the printed table**.

---

## 1) Fundamental reporting discrepancy: Standard errors should not be there

### Mismatch
- **True Results:** Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only** and **does not print standard errors**.
- **Generated Results:** `table1_style` prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like **SEs** (e.g., educ in Model 1: `-0.310***` then `-0.038`).

### Why this is a problem
Those “SEs” cannot be validated against Table 1 (because Table 1 doesn’t provide SEs), so the generated output is not comparable to the printed table.

### Fix
- **Remove SEs from the table output** to match Table 1 exactly, *or* if you want to keep SEs for your own purposes, clearly label them as “computed SEs (not shown in Table 1)” and do **not** claim they match the PDF.
- Ensure the table title/notes say “standardized betas” and omit SE rows.

## 2) Sample size (N) mismatches (all models)

### Mismatches
| Model | Generated N | True N | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Model 1 (SES) | 748 | 787 | -39 |
| Model 2 (Demographic) | 738 | 756 | -18 |
| Model 3 (Political intolerance) | 486 | 503 | -17 |

### Likely causes (based on your diagnostics)
- You restricted to `N_complete_music_18 = 893` and then did listwise deletion.
- The paper likely uses **a different inclusion rule**, such as:
  - different age restriction (or none),
  - different definition of “valid DV”,
  - different missing-data handling,
  - different recodes (especially for race/ethnicity, religion, intolerance index),
  - possibly survey weights or GSS-specific missing codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) treated differently.

### Fix
To reproduce the printed Ns, you must replicate the paper’s **exact**:
1) year/age filters,  
2) missing value recodes (GSS uses special numeric missing codes),  
3) construction rules for indices (esp. political intolerance), and  
4) whether any cases with “don’t know / refusal” were retained via recoding.

Concretely:
- Audit each variable for special missing codes and convert them to NA before listwise deletion.
- Rebuild the political intolerance scale using the **paper’s item set and inclusion threshold** (see Section 6).
- Re-check whether the paper uses **pairwise** handling anywhere (less likely with OLS tables, but possible if index constructed differently).

## 3) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj. R², constants)

### R² / Adj. R² mismatches
| Model | Generated R² | True R² | Generated Adj R² | True Adj R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Model 1 | 0.0975 | 0.107 | 0.0938 | 0.104 |
| Model 2 | 0.1267 | 0.151 | 0.1135 | 0.139 |
| Model 3 | 0.1362 | 0.169 | 0.1143 | 0.148 |

### Constant mismatches
| Model | Generated constant | True constant |
|---|---:|---:|
| Model 1 | 10.848 | 10.920 |
| Model 2 | 8.692 | 8.507 |
| Model 3 | 6.326 | 6.516 |

### Explanation
These differences are exactly what you’d expect from:
- different N,
- different coding/recoding of predictors,
- different DV construction, and/or
- different standardization procedure (see next).

### Fix
Once you match:
- the analytic sample (Ns), and
- the exact variable constructions,
your intercepts and R² should move toward the printed values. If they still don’t, the next suspect is **how “standardized coefficients” were produced** (Section 4).

---

## 4) Coefficient mismatches (by variable, by model)

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.310*** | -0.322*** | coefficient too small in magnitude |
| Income per capita | -0.038 | -0.037 | close (tiny diff) |
| Occupational prestige | 0.025 | 0.016 | too large |
| Constant | 10.848 | 10.920 | differs |

**Fix:** Align standardization + sample + prestige coding. Prestige is often tricky (different prestige scale variants, top-coding, or missing handling). Ensure you’re using the same prestige variable version as in the paper (they label it “Occupational prestige,” but you used `prestg80`—that may be right, but the recode rules must match).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.247*** | -0.246*** | matches |
| Income per capita | -0.053 | -0.054 | close |
| Occupational prestige | 0.009 | -0.006 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.079* | -0.083* | close |
| Age | 0.112** | 0.140*** | too small + wrong significance |
| Black | 0.012 | 0.029 | too small |
| Hispanic | 0.014 | -0.029 | wrong sign |
| Other race | 0.000 | 0.005 | too small |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.090* | 0.059 | too large + wrong significance |
| No religion | -0.000 | -0.012 | too small |
| Southern | 0.064 | 0.097** | too small + wrong significance |
| Constant | 8.692 | 8.507 | differs |

**Interpretation/significance mismatches (important):**
- **Age:** True is ***; generated is ** (and smaller beta).
- **Southern:** True is **; generated is not significant.
- **Conservative Protestant:** True is not significant; generated is *.

**Fix:** These point strongly to **coding differences** (especially for age scaling/standardization and for the religion + region dummies) and sample differences.

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.124* | -0.151** | too small + wrong significance level |
| Income per capita | -0.040 | -0.009 | much too negative |
| Occupational prestige | 0.006 | -0.022 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.095* | matches |
| Age | 0.073 | 0.110* | too small + wrong significance |
| Black | 0.027 | 0.049 | too small |
| Hispanic | 0.033 | 0.031 | matches |
| Other race | 0.060 | 0.053 | close |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.093* | 0.066 | too large + wrong significance |
| No religion | 0.034 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.066 | 0.121** | far too small + wrong sig |
| Political intolerance | 0.195*** | 0.164*** | too large |
| Constant | 6.326 | 6.516 | differs |

**Fix:** The largest “structural” mismatch here is the **political intolerance coefficient** (too large) plus the major changes in SES betas (education, income, prestige). This almost always happens when the intolerance index is constructed differently (items, scaling, missing rules) or when the model’s analytic sample differs.

---

## 5) Variable-name mismatches vs “as named in Table 1”

### Mismatch
Generated uses internal names:
- `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`

True table labels:
- Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, etc.

### Fix
This is mostly presentation, but to “match the generated analysis,” rename terms in the output table to match the PDF labels exactly. (This won’t change coefficients, but it fixes a mismatch in *variable naming*.)

---

## 6) Political intolerance scale construction mismatch (very likely)

### Evidence in your diagnostics
- `polintol_min_items_required = 12`
- `tol_items_answered_mean = 9.77` with min 0, max 15
- You have **312 missing** on `political_intolerance` among the “music complete” sample, leaving N=486.

This suggests you required **12 answered items** out of 15, but the average answered is ~9.8—so you dropped many cases. The paper’s N for model 3 is **503**, meaning their rule is less restrictive and/or items differ and/or missing codes treated differently.

### Fix
To match Table 1 you need to replicate exactly:
- which tolerance items were included,
- how they were scored (binary? summed? standardized?),
- minimum items required (or whether missing items were imputed/treated as 0),
- and whether the index was standardized.

Practical steps:
1) Re-read the paper’s measurement section for “political intolerance” index construction.
2) Recompute the index identically (including handling of “don’t know/refused”).
3) Re-run Model 3 on the same eligible set.

---

## 7) Standardization procedure mismatch (betas)

### Mismatch pattern
Some betas match closely (education in Model 2; female Model 3), but others drift a lot (age, southern, income in Model 3, prestige sign flips).

This can happen if:
- you standardized using the analysis sample vs full sample differently than the authors,
- you standardized *after* recoding dummies vs before (shouldn’t matter much for 0/1 but can if missing recodes differ),
- you computed “standardized coefficients” by standardizing X and Y manually vs using a package’s beta method that handles intercept/weights differently,
- the paper used **weighted** standardization and regression.

### Fix
- Confirm whether the paper uses survey weights (common in GSS work). If yes:
  - run weighted OLS,
  - compute standardized coefficients consistent with weights.
- Standardize exactly as the authors: typically  
  \[
  \beta^{std} = b \cdot \frac{SD(X)}{SD(Y)}
  \]
  using the model’s estimation sample (and weights if applicable).

---

## 8) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

### Mismatches (examples)
- Model 2 Age: generated ** vs true ***
- Model 2 Conservative Protestant: generated * vs true none
- Model 2 Southern: generated none vs true **
- Model 3 Education: generated * vs true **
- Model 3 Age: generated none vs true *
- Model 3 Southern: generated none vs true **

### Fix
Once the coding + sample + weights are corrected, the p-values should align better. Also ensure:
- two-tailed tests (the table says two-tailed),
- same alpha thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001),
- correct degrees of freedom (affected by N).

---

## 9) What you should change in your pipeline (checklist)

To make the generated analysis match Table 1:

1) **Match the analytic sample**
   - Use the same year(s), age restrictions, and inclusion rules as the paper.
   - Recode all GSS-style missing codes to NA before listwise deletion.

2) **Reconstruct variables exactly**
   - DV “Number of music genres disliked”: ensure same item set and counting rules.
   - `income_pc`: match the paper’s definition of “household income per capita” (equivalence scale? household size measure? inflation adjustments?).
   - `prestg80`: ensure same prestige variable and missing/topcode handling.
   - Race/ethnicity dummies: confirm whether Hispanic is mutually exclusive with race categories in the paper’s coding (common source of sign flips).
   - Religion: confirm reference category; your `conservative_protestant`/`no_religion` must match their categories.

3) **Political intolerance index**
   - Use the identical items and scoring.
   - Use the same missingness rule (your “12 items required” is likely not what they used).
   - Standardize consistently.

4) **Use the same estimation approach**
   - If the paper uses weights: apply them.
   - Compute standardized betas the same way.

5) **Report in the same format**
   - Output **standardized coefficients only** (no SE lines) to match the printed table.

---

If you share (a) the code you used to build `income_pc` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) the exact dataset/source (e.g., GSS extract details), I can pinpoint which specific recode/eligibility rule is causing each of the big coefficient/significance flips (notably: prestige sign in Model 2, Hispanic sign in Model 2, and Southern/age attenuation).
