Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** depart from the **True Results (Table 1 as printed)**, split into (A) variable naming, (B) coefficients/stars, (C) standard errors, (D) fit statistics and Ns, and (E) interpretation/estimation choices. For each discrepancy I say what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the printed table.

---

## A) Variable names: mismatches / standardization of labels

Most names correspond, but several do **not match the PDF labels** exactly.

1) **Education**
- Generated term: `educ`
- True label: **Education**
- Fix: relabel `educ` → “Education” in the output table (cosmetic only).

2) **Household income per capita**
- Generated term: `income_pc`
- True label: **Household income per capita**
- Fix: relabel `income_pc` accordingly (cosmetic only).

3) **Occupational prestige**
- Generated term: `prestg80`
- True label: **Occupational prestige**
- Fix: relabel `prestg80` accordingly (cosmetic only).

4) **Political intolerance**
- Generated term: `political_intolerance`
- True label: **Political intolerance**
- Fix: relabel to match (cosmetic only).

No evidence of wrong variables included/omitted by name (the same conceptual set appears in each model), but several coefficients differ (next section), which strongly suggests **coding/standardization/sample differences**, not just naming.

---

## B) Standardized coefficients + significance stars: EVERY mismatch

Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients**. Your generated table also appears to be standardized (and your `coefficients_long` says `beta_std`). Even so, many betas and stars do not match the printed ones.

### Model 1 (SES): coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.332*** | **-0.322*** | magnitude too negative |
| Income per capita | -0.034 (ns) | -0.037 (ns) | slightly off |
| Occupational prestige | **0.029 (ns)** | **0.016 (ns)** | notably off |

Also:
- **Constant**: Generated 11.086 vs True 10.920 (mismatch)
- **R²**: Generated 0.109 vs True 0.107 (mismatch)
- **Adj R²**: Generated 0.105 vs True 0.104 (mismatch)
- **N**: Generated **758** vs True **787** (major mismatch)

### Model 2 (Demographic): coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.260*** | **-0.246*** | too negative |
| Income per capita | -0.051 (ns) | -0.054 (ns) | slightly off |
| Occupational prestige | **0.007 (ns)** | **-0.006 (ns)** | wrong sign |
| Female | **-0.090** (**) | **-0.083** (*) | magnitude & **star differs** |
| Age | **0.129*** | **0.140*** | too small |
| Black | **0.009 (ns)** | **0.029 (ns)** | too small |
| Hispanic | **0.026 (ns)** | **-0.029 (ns)** | wrong sign |
| Other race | 0.001 (ns) | 0.005 (ns) | off |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.065 (ns) | 0.059 (ns) | off |
| No religion | -0.005 (ns) | -0.012 (ns) | off |
| Southern | **0.085***? (your table shows `0.085*`) | **0.097** (**) | magnitude & **star differs** |

Also:
- **Constant**: 8.804 vs 8.507 (mismatch)
- **R²**: 0.145 vs 0.151 (mismatch)
- **Adj R²**: 0.133 vs 0.139 (mismatch)
- **N**: **756 vs 756** (this one matches)

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155** | -0.151** | slightly off |
| Income per capita | **-0.016 (ns)** | **-0.009 (ns)** | too negative |
| Occupational prestige | **-0.008 (ns)** | **-0.022 (ns)** | too small |
| Female | **-0.116***? (your table shows `-0.116*`) | **-0.095** (*) | magnitude differs |
| Age | **0.060 (ns)** | **0.110** (*) | big mismatch + significance differs |
| Black | **-0.005 (ns)** | **0.049 (ns)** | wrong sign and magnitude |
| Hispanic | **0.090 (ns)** | **0.031 (ns)** | too large |
| Other race | 0.052 (ns) | 0.053 (ns) | essentially matches |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.051 (ns) | 0.066 (ns) | off |
| No religion | 0.017 (ns) | 0.024 (ns) | off |
| Southern | **0.090 (ns)** | **0.121** (**) | too small + stars differ |
| Political intolerance | **0.172** (**) | **0.164*** | too large and **star differs** |

Also:
- **Constant**: 7.258 vs 6.516 (mismatch)
- **R²**: **0.143 vs 0.169** (major mismatch)
- **Adj R²**: 0.118 vs 0.148 (major mismatch)
- **N**: **426 vs 503** (major mismatch)

## C) Standard errors: generated output is incompatible with “true” table

- **True Results:** explicitly state **Table 1 does not report standard errors**.
- **Generated Results:** your `table1_style` clearly prints a second row under each coefficient that looks like an SE (e.g., educ has “-0.332***” then “-0.034”).

**This is not a “mismatch” you can reconcile by tweaking numbers**, because the “true” reference table simply does not contain SEs.

**Fix options (choose one):**
1) To match the printed Table 1: **remove SEs from the generated table entirely** and report only standardized betas + stars + fit stats, as in the PDF.
2) If you must keep SEs: you need a different “true” benchmark (e.g., appendix table, replication materials). Otherwise you cannot claim agreement.

---

## D) Fit statistics and sample sizes: major discrepancies

### 1) N differs in Model 1 and Model 3
- Model 1: Generated **758** vs True **787**
- Model 3: Generated **426** vs True **503**

This is the single strongest sign you are not reproducing the published estimation sample(s).

**Likely causes given your diagnostics:**
- You restrict to **year==1993** and “complete_music_18” (893) and then do listwise deletion.
- You require political intolerance to be complete on **all 15 items** (“require complete responses on all 15 items”), which is very strict and produces N=426.

**Fix: match the paper’s inclusion rules exactly.**
You need to determine (from the paper/PDF methods):
- Did they use **weights**?
- Did they include multiple years or only 1993?
- Did they use a **subset of respondents** (e.g., only those asked intolerance battery)?
- How did they handle missingness on intolerance items? (common alternatives: mean of nonmissing items with a minimum number answered; scale if ≥k items; imputation; or factor score)
- Did they use **pairwise deletion** for scale construction but listwise for regression?
- Did they recode “don’t know/refused” differently than NA?

Until those rules match, coefficients, R², and stars will keep diverging.

### 2) R² / Adj R² differ (especially Model 3)
- Generated Model 3 R²=0.143 vs True 0.169.
This is fully consistent with having a different N and/or different construction of political intolerance.

**Fix:** once the sample and variable construction match, R² should move into alignment.

---

## E) Interpretation/estimation choices: where your pipeline likely diverges from the published one

These aren’t “interpretation text” errors (none is shown), but they are **procedural interpretation** problems that change the numbers.

### 1) Overly strict political intolerance construction
Your diagnostic says:
> “sum of 15 intolerance indicators; require complete responses on all 15 items”

That almost certainly explains N dropping from 503 (true) to 426 (generated).

**Fix:** replicate the paper’s intolerance scale rule. Common published rules:
- Sum/average across answered items if respondent answered at least (say) 10/15.
- Standardize an index built from available items.
- Use a factor score.
If the PDF doesn’t specify, you must inspect their replication code or appendices; otherwise exact matching is unlikely.

### 2) Hispanic coding rule likely not matching the publication
Your diagnostic says:
> “if race nonmissing: missing ETHNIC -> 0 (non-Hispanic); else NA; if ETHNIC==1 -> 1”

That is a strong assumption and can change coefficients (and sign). In your Model 2, **Hispanic is positive (0.026)** while the true table shows **negative (-0.029)**.

**Fix:**
- Code Hispanic exactly as the study does (often Hispanic is treated as an ethnicity overriding race categories; sometimes respondents who are Hispanic are removed from race dummies or coded differently).
- Ensure “Black/Hispanic/Other race” are constructed with the same reference group and rules (often White non-Hispanic is the baseline, and “Hispanic” may be exclusive of race dummies).

### 3) Standardization procedure must match the published table
You standardize “DV and predictors within each model’s listwise-complete sample.”

If the authors standardized using:
- the **full analysis sample** (common), or
- a **common sample across models**, or
- unstandardized regression with post-hoc standardization using full-sample SDs,

then your standardized betas will differ.

**Fix:** Determine the paper’s standardization convention. To reproduce Table 1, you typically must:
- Use the **same sample** per model as they did, and
- Standardize using the same SDs they used (often the estimation sample SDs, but not always).

### 4) Potential weighting / complex survey design
Many sociology papers using GSS-like data use **weights**; significance stars can change if:
- weights are applied, and/or
- robust/clustered SEs are used, and/or
- design-based SEs are used.

Your stars differ in multiple places (e.g., Female, Southern, Political intolerance).

**Fix:** confirm whether Table 1 used:
- weighted OLS,
- robust SEs,
- clustering/stratification.
Then implement the same. If Table 1 is from weighted regression but you ran unweighted, coefficients and R² can also shift.

## Concrete “to-do” list to make the generated analysis match the True Table 1

1) **Stop printing SEs** in the “Table 1” output (since the true table has none), or clearly label them as “replication SEs not in PDF”.
2) **Recreate the exact Ns**:
   - Model 1 must be N=787 (not 758).
   - Model 3 must be N=503 (not 426).
   This requires matching the paper’s sample restrictions and missing-data rules.
3) **Rebuild political intolerance** using the paper’s stated rule (do not require complete data on all 15 items unless the paper says so).
4) **Recode race/ethnicity dummies** to match the publication’s scheme (especially Hispanic handling) and verify the reference group.
5) **Match standardization method** (same sample and SD convention as the authors).
6) **Match weighting/SE conventions** if used in the paper; this is crucial for getting the same stars.

If you paste the PDF’s methods paragraph (sample restrictions, weighting, and intolerance scale construction) or the codebook notes for the intolerance items and ethnicity/race variables, I can tell you exactly which of (2)–(6) is responsible for each coefficient/significance mismatch and how to modify the code step-by-step.
