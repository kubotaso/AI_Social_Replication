Score: 49/100
============================================================

## A. Global/structural mismatches

### 1) **Wrong sample sizes (n) in all three models**
- **Generated:** n = 747 (M1), 507 (M2), 286 (M3)  
- **True:** n = 787 (M1), 756 (M2), 503 (M3)
- **Fix:** Your estimation dataset is not the paper’s estimation dataset. The drop in n across models is far too large and inconsistent with the paper (which has *more* cases in Models 2–3 than your generated models).
  - Reproduce the paper’s inclusion rules: same GSS year (1993), same DV construction, same coding of race/religion/region, and same handling of missing data.
  - Do **not** listwise-delete on variables that are not used in that model.
  - Verify that your “pol_intol” is built from the same items and coding as the paper’s “Political intolerance”; your missingness table shows ~47% missing on `pol_intol`, which would indeed crush n—yet the paper’s Model 3 has n=503 (not 286). That implies your intolerance scale is misconstructed or you’re merging/filtering incorrectly.

### 2) **Reporting the wrong quantities for Table 1**
- **Generated “Table1style” columns:** you report **standardized betas** for *all terms including the constant* (you keep constants unstandardized but you label other terms as betas) and you also show p-values/SEs elsewhere.
- **True Table 1:** reports **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors, **unstandardized constants**, and **does not report SEs**.
- **Fix:** To match the paper, your “Table1style” output should:
  - show **β only** for predictors,
  - show **unstandardized intercept**,
  - omit SEs entirely (or mark as “—”),
  - apply the paper’s star thresholds (*p*<.05, .01, .001).

### 3) **Dropped predictor problem (“otherrace” becomes NaN)**
- **Generated:** “Other race” is `NaN` in Models 2–3; fit stats say `dropped_predictors = otherrace`.
- **True:** “Other race” is included with nonzero β (Model 2 β=0.005; Model 3 β=0.053).
- **Fix:** This is almost certainly a **coding/collinearity/reference-category** error:
  - If race is represented as three dummies (black, hispanic, otherrace) with **white omitted**, keep all three; do **not** also include a full set of race-category dummies plus an intercept.
  - Ensure `otherrace` is not perfectly predicted (e.g., always 0 after filtering) and not identical to another variable.
  - Confirm it’s numeric (0/1) with variation in the analysis sample.

## B. Model-by-model mismatches (βs, constants, R²/Adj R²)

### Model 1 (SES)

**Fit**
- **Generated:** R² = 0.088, Adj R² = 0.085, n=747  
- **True:** R² = 0.107, Adj R² = 0.104, n=787  
- **Fix:** use correct sample + correct DV and predictor coding; R² will change once n/codings align.

**Coefficients (standardized β)**
- Education:
  - **Generated:** β = **-0.292***  
  - **True:** β = **-0.322***  
  - **Fix:** mismatch likely from different sample/coding (years of education top-coding, missing handling, weighting).
- Income per capita:
  - **Generated:** β = **-0.039**  
  - **True:** β = **-0.037**  
  - Fix minor; will likely align after sample correction.
- Occupational prestige:
  - **Generated:** β = **0.020**  
  - **True:** β = **0.016**  
  - Fix minor; again sample/coding.

**Constant**
- **Generated:** 10.638  
- **True:** 10.920  
- **Fix:** intercept depends on unstandardized model and sample; once the estimation sample and variable scaling match, it should move toward 10.920.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

**Fit**
- **Generated:** R²=0.135, Adj R²=0.118, n=507  
- **True:** R²=0.151, Adj R²=0.139, n=756  
- **Fix:** major sample mismatch (listwise deletion / wrong construction of predictors) is the main issue.

**Coefficients (standardized β) — every mismatch**
- Education:
  - **Generated:** -0.264***  
  - **True:** -0.246***  
- Income per capita:
  - **Generated:** -0.053  
  - **True:** -0.054  
- Occupational prestige:
  - **Generated:** -0.016  
  - **True:** -0.006  
- Female:
  - **Generated:** -0.090*  
  - **True:** -0.083*  
- Age:
  - **Generated:** +0.104*  
  - **True:** +0.140***  (**both size and significance wrong**)  
  - **Fix:** This is a red flag for sample/coding error. Age effect usually stabilizes; your reduced n and/or age coding (`age_v`) may differ (e.g., age restrictions, missing recode).
- Black:
  - **Generated:** +0.043  
  - **True:** +0.029  
- Hispanic:
  - **Generated:** +0.030  
  - **True:** **-0.029** (**sign mismatch**)  
  - **Fix:** likely the “Hispanic” dummy is reversed/miscoded (1/0 flipped) or the reference group differs.
- Other race:
  - **Generated:** blank/NaN (dropped)  
  - **True:** +0.005  
  - **Fix:** see dropped-predictor section.
- Conservative Protestant:
  - **Generated:** +0.090  
  - **True:** +0.059  
- No religion:
  - **Generated:** -0.019  
  - **True:** -0.012  
- Southern:
  - **Generated:** +0.063  
  - **True:** +0.097** (**magnitude + significance mismatch**)  
  - **Fix:** likely `south` coding mismatch (e.g., region vs Census South; or includes border states differently), plus sample mismatch.

**Constant**
- **Generated:** 9.285  
- **True:** 8.507  
- **Fix:** again points to different sample and/or different unstandardized scaling of predictors.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

**Fit**
- **Generated:** R²=0.145, Adj R²=0.111, n=286  
- **True:** R²=0.169, Adj R²=0.148, n=503  
- **Fix:** your political intolerance variable construction or missing-data handling is severely shrinking the sample; also likely miscoded.

**Coefficients (standardized β) — every mismatch**
- Education:
  - **Generated:** -0.157*  
  - **True:** -0.151** (**star mismatch**)  
  - **Fix:** star mismatch could be due to smaller n (less power) and/or different SEs.
- Income per capita:
  - **Generated:** -0.050  
  - **True:** -0.009 (**large mismatch**)  
  - **Fix:** suggests your `inc_pc` is not the same as the paper’s (could be wrong denominator, inflation, transformation, or treated as dollars vs thousands).
- Occupational prestige:
  - **Generated:** -0.011  
  - **True:** -0.022  
- Female:
  - **Generated:** -0.122*  
  - **True:** -0.095*  
- Age:
  - **Generated:** +0.083 (ns)  
  - **True:** +0.110* (**magnitude + significance mismatch**)  
- Black:
  - **Generated:** +0.107  
  - **True:** +0.049  
- Hispanic:
  - **Generated:** +0.028  
  - **True:** +0.031 (close)
- Other race:
  - **Generated:** dropped/blank  
  - **True:** +0.053  
- Conservative Protestant:
  - **Generated:** +0.037  
  - **True:** +0.066  
- No religion:
  - **Generated:** +0.024  
  - **True:** +0.024 (matches)
- Southern:
  - **Generated:** +0.065  
  - **True:** +0.121** (**large mismatch**)  
- Political intolerance:
  - **Generated:** +0.190**  
  - **True:** +0.164*** (**size + star mismatch**)  
  - **Fix:** most likely your intolerance scale differs (range, items, reverse coding) and your n is much smaller, shifting both β and p.

**Constant**
- **Generated:** 7.360  
- **True:** 6.516  
- **Fix:** sample + coding.

## C. Standard errors and p-values: interpretation mismatch

### 4) You report SEs and p-values as if they are part of “Table 1”
- **True:** SEs are *not reported* in the paper’s table; stars are.
- **Generated:** includes p-values everywhere and implies conventional OLS inference.
- **Fix:** If the goal is to match Table 1, do not compare/print SEs and p-values as “true mismatches”—they’re not in the true output. Instead:
  - compute stars from your p-values using the paper’s thresholds and compare stars only.
  - If you want comparability, ensure you use the same design decisions (weights, clustering, robust vs classical SE). Any difference changes p-values/stars.

---

## D. Variable-name mismatches / labeling issues

### 5) Variable label mismatches that can hide coding errors
- **Generated uses:** `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, `female`, `age_v`, `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south`, `pol_intol`.
- **True table labels:** Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Political intolerance.
- **Fix:** Mapping is fine *if* coding matches. But given sign reversals (Hispanic in Model 2) and dropped otherrace, you should add a “codebook check” step:
  - show category frequencies by model sample (e.g., mean of each dummy),
  - confirm reference categories (White, non-South, etc.),
  - confirm that `female=1` corresponds to women (not men).

## E. How to fix so the generated analysis matches the true table (action checklist)

1) **Rebuild the analytic samples to match n**
   - Filter to **GSS 1993** only and to the same respondent universe as the paper.
   - Use **model-specific listwise deletion** (only variables in that model).
   - Diagnose why `pol_intol` is missing for ~47%—that is inconsistent with Model 3 n=503.

2) **Recode race correctly and prevent dummy trap**
   - Create mutually exclusive dummies: `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, with White omitted.
   - Verify each has variation in the Model 2 and Model 3 sample; otherwise it will be dropped.

3) **Fix Hispanic sign issue**
   - Cross-tab `hispanic` with race/ethnicity source variable; verify 1 means Hispanic.
   - Ensure you didn’t accidentally code `hispanic = 1 - hispanic_original`.

4) **Reconstruct “household income per capita” exactly**
   - Large Model 3 mismatch suggests `inc_pc` is not comparable.
   - Confirm: is it household income divided by household size? Is it already in dollars? Did the paper rescale (e.g., thousands) or top-code?

5) **Reconstruct political intolerance scale**
   - Match the paper’s item set, scoring, and range (paper: “Political intolerance” in the model; your label says 0–15 but your data show many 15s and lots of missingness).
   - Verify whether “don’t know/refused/not asked” are being coded as missing correctly (and not accidentally turned into missing for many items).

6) **Match the table’s reporting style**
   - Output: standardized β for predictors, unstandardized constant, stars with the paper’s cutoffs, and no SE column.

If you provide the code you used to (a) build `inc_pc` and `pol_intol`, and (b) generate the model samples, I can point to the exact line(s) that cause the n collapse, the dropped `otherrace`, and the Hispanic sign flip.
