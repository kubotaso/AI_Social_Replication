============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics: n, R², adjusted R²

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Mismatch (n):** Generated **n=793** vs True **n=787**.
  - **Fix:** Use the *exact same estimation sample* as the paper (listwise deletion on the Model 1 variables only, using the same missing-data rules/codings). If you’re using GSS, ensure you’re dropping GSS “inapplicable/Don’t know/No answer” codes (often negative values) consistently before computing `inc_pc`, `prestg80`, etc.

- **Match (R²/Adj R²):** Generated **R²=0.107613, adj=0.104220** ≈ True **0.107 / 0.104**.
  - This suggests Model 1 is close in specification/sample, but the n discrepancy indicates you’re not filtering exactly the same way.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Major mismatch (n):** Generated **n=37** vs True **n=756**.
- **Major mismatch (R²/Adj R²):** Generated **R²=0.489, adj=0.343** vs True **R²=0.151, adj=0.139**.
  - **Fix:** This is almost certainly caused by catastrophic missingness from one or more predictors (your diagnostics show some variables have ~1500 missing), leaving only 37 complete cases under listwise deletion.
  - Concretely: variables like `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `norelig` appear **NaN** in the coefficient table, and the diagnostics suggest at least one variable has **nonmissing ~108** (meaning it wipes out the sample when included).
  - Steps to fix:
    1. **Recode race/ethnicity and religion variables correctly** (see Section 3).
    2. Ensure binary indicators are coded 0/1 and are not mostly missing because of using the wrong source variable or wrong wave-specific variable name.
    3. Re-run Model 2 after verifying each predictor’s valid N.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Major mismatch (n):** Generated **n=19** vs True **n=503**.
- **Major mismatch (R²/Adj R²):** Generated **R²=0.588, adj=0.176** vs True **R²=0.169, adj=0.148**.
  - **Fix:** Same issue as Model 2, plus likely a bad construction of `pol_intol` causing near-total missingness (your diagnostics show one variable has **n_unique_nonmissing=2** with only **108 nonmissing**—that’s consistent with a misbuilt index or wrong variable). Rebuild the political intolerance measure exactly as in the paper and confirm valid N.

## 2) Variable names / included variables

### Naming differences (mostly superficial but must map correctly)
- Generated uses: `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80`, `cons_prot`, `pol_intol`
- True table labels: Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Conservative Protestant, Political intolerance
  - **Fix:** Ensure these are truly the same constructs:
    - `educ_yrs` should match the paper’s education measure (likely years of schooling).
    - `inc_pc` must be *household income per capita* (household income divided by household size, using the same income measure as the authors).
    - `prestg80` must be the same occupational prestige scale (and the same handling for nonworkers).
    - `cons_prot`, `norelig` must be derived from the same religion coding scheme the paper uses.
    - `pol_intol` must match the paper’s political intolerance scale construction.

### Missing/undefined predictors in generated output
- In Model 2 and 3, coefficients are **NaN** for `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `norelig` (and maybe others).
  - **Interpretation:** Your model matrix likely has **all-missing columns**, **zero variance**, or perfect collinearity after filtering.
  - **Fix:** Recreate these dummies so they are non-missing and vary in the estimation sample, and ensure you have a valid reference group (e.g., White non-Hispanic omitted, mainline/other religion omitted, etc.).

## 3) Coefficients: sign, magnitude, and (standardization) interpretation

A crucial conceptual mismatch explains many coefficient differences:

### A) True coefficients are **standardized β**, but your generated betas look **unstandardized b**
- Evidence:
  - True Model 1 education β is **-0.322**; your Model 1 education is **-0.3297** (close), which *could* happen by coincidence, but then:
  - True Model 2 education β is **-0.246** while your Model 2 education is **-0.7956** (way too large in magnitude for standardized β).
  - True constants are ~10.920, 8.507, 6.516; your constants are 10.83, 8.69, **-7.19** (Model 3 constant is wildly off).
- **Fix (must-do):** To match the paper’s table, you need to report **standardized coefficients** for predictors.
  - Standard approach: standardize y and all x’s (except the constant) before OLS, or compute β from unstandardized b via  
    \[
    \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{sd(x_j)}{sd(y)}
    \]
  - Keep in mind: the paper notes **constants are unstandardized**. If you fully standardize y, the intercept becomes ~0, which won’t match. So: **standardize predictors only**, or compute standardized betas post hoc while leaving intercept unstandardized.

### B) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches

#### Model 1
- **Education (`educ_yrs`)**
  - Generated: **-0.3297*** vs True: **-0.322*** → close.
  - **Fix:** Minor; likely sample differences (n mismatch) and/or rounding.

- **Income per capita (`inc_pc`)**
  - Generated: **-0.0336 (ns)** vs True: **-0.037 (ns)** → close.

- **Prestige (`prestg80`)**
  - Generated: **0.0291 (ns)** vs True: **0.016 (ns)** → somewhat off but same sign and non-sig.
  - **Fix:** Align sample and prestige coding (especially missing for not-in-labor-force).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.833** vs True: **10.920** → minor.
  - **Fix:** sample/coding alignment.

#### Model 2 (Demographic): nearly everything is wrong
Compare signs and approximate magnitude (true β in parentheses):

- **Education:** Generated **-0.796** vs True **-0.246** → magnitude wrong (and likely unstandardized).
- **Income:** Generated **+0.182** vs True **-0.054** → **wrong sign**.
- **Prestige:** Generated **+0.425** vs True **-0.006** → **wrong sign and huge**.
- **Female:** Generated **+0.077** vs True **-0.083** → **wrong sign**.
- **Age:** Generated **-0.018** vs True **+0.140** → **wrong sign**.
- **Black:** Generated **+0.025** vs True **+0.029** → sign matches, but your estimate is meaningless given n=37.
- **Hispanic / Other race / No religion:** Generated **NaN** vs True has finite values → construction/coding failure.
- **Conservative Protestant:** Generated **+0.320 (p=.063)** vs True **+0.059 (ns)** → too large; also sample collapse.
- **Southern:** Generated **+0.224 (ns)** vs True **+0.097** ** → too large and wrong sig.
- **Constant:** 8.69 vs 8.507 → close-ish, but again n is broken.

**Fix for Model 2:** you won’t fix coefficient sign/magnitude without:
1) fixing the sample collapse (get n≈756), and  
2) producing standardized βs, and  
3) ensuring coding matches (female, age direction, race dummies, religion, south).

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance): also broadly wrong
- **Constant:** Generated **-7.185** vs True **+6.516** → indicates either y is different, predictors are wildly mis-scaled, or you standardized y / centered incorrectly without handling intercept like the paper.
- **Education:** -0.284 vs -0.151 (too large)
- **Income:** +0.207 vs -0.009 (wrong sign)
- **Prestige:** +0.511 vs -0.022 (wrong sign)
- **Female:** +0.206 vs -0.095 (wrong sign)
- **Age:** +0.148 vs +0.110 (sign ok but n=19 makes it noise)
- **Political intolerance:** +0.313 vs +0.164 (too large; also not significant in your output but should be *** in true table)
- **Hispanic/Other race/No religion:** NaN vs finite → same dummy construction failure.

**Fix for Model 3:** rebuild `pol_intol` correctly and restore sample (n≈503) before worrying about coefficient matching.

## 4) Standard errors and significance reporting

### SEs
- **Mismatch:** Generated output provides **p-values** (implying SEs exist), but the **true table does not report SEs**—only significance stars.
  - **Fix:** If the goal is to match the paper’s presentation, remove SE/p columns and show β with stars only. If you keep p-values, note explicitly they are from your replication and will not match the published display.

### Significance stars
- Because your Model 2/3 n is tiny, p-values/stars will be unstable and won’t match the paper.
  - **Fix:** First fix sample size and variable construction. Then apply the paper’s two-tailed thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001).

## 5) Diagnostics table: what it implies is broken (and how to correct)

Your diagnostics show, for some variables, extremely low nonmissing counts (e.g., **108 nonmissing, 1498 missing**; others ~850 nonmissing). That explains n=37 and n=19.

### Likely causes
1. **Using wave-specific variables not available in 1993** (or using variables that are only asked of subsets).
2. **Not recoding GSS missing codes** (e.g., -1, -2, -3) to NA before building composites/dummies.
3. **Incorrect dummy creation** (e.g., `hispanic` derived from a variable that is missing for most cases; or created as all NA due to a conditional).
4. **Perfect collinearity / reference category errors** (less likely to create 37 cases, but can create NaN coefficients).

### Fix checklist (practical)
- For every predictor in each model:
  1. Print valid N **after recoding**.
  2. Print value counts (0/1 proportions for dummies).
  3. Confirm the model’s estimation N matches the paper approximately (Model1 ~787; Model2 ~756; Model3 ~503).
- Only then compare coefficients.

## 6) What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1. **Use the same dependent variable**: “Number of music genres disliked” exactly as constructed in the paper (same items, same missing handling). A wrong DV can flip signs and destroy the intercept (your Model 3 intercept strongly suggests this is possible).
2. **Recode missing values properly** for all GSS variables before any transformations.
3. **Rebuild race/ethnicity and religion dummies** so `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `norelig`, `cons_prot` are non-missing and correctly defined; omit the correct reference group.
4. **Fix the political intolerance scale** (`pol_intol`) to match the paper and ensure it has wide coverage in 1993; verify valid N isn’t ~108.
5. **Ensure listwise deletion is applied per model** (Model 1 uses only SES variables; Model 2 adds demographic variables; Model 3 adds political intolerance). Don’t accidentally carry forward Model 3 restrictions into Model 2, etc.
6. **Report standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors (and keep constants unstandardized, as the paper does).
7. **Match the table format**: no SEs (paper doesn’t report them), only β and stars.

If you tell me (a) the exact GSS variable names you used for race, religion, income, and intolerance, and (b) how you built “genres disliked,” I can pinpoint exactly which variable(s) are causing the n to collapse and the NaNs.
