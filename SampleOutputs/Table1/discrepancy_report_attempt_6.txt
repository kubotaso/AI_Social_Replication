============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True (PDF Table 1) results**, covering **fit statistics, variable inclusion/names, standardized coefficients, (non‑)standard errors, and interpretation/significance**—and exactly what to change so the generated analysis matches the printed table.

---

## 1) Fit statistics: N, R², Adjusted R² all mismatch

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **758**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller (listwise deletion and/or different filtering). Recreate the same sample used in the PDF:
    - Use the same survey wave/subsample.
    - Use the same missing-data handling as the authors (often **listwise deletion but on the model’s variables**, not additional variables).
    - Ensure you’re not inadvertently dropping cases via earlier recodes (e.g., creating dummies with missing -> NA).

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.1088 / 0.1052**
  - True: **0.107 / 0.104**
  - These are close; the bigger red flag is **N differs**, so the model is not the same.  
  - **Fix:** Once the sample (N) matches, R² should align closely.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **306**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is a major discrepancy driven by missingness in your constructed predictors (see §4). You are dropping *huge* numbers of cases because some variables are missing in your version but apparently not missing (or differently coded) in the authors’ version.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.182 / 0.155**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** These will change once N and coding match.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **171**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Same core issue: you’re losing cases due to (a) missing polintol, (b) missing conserv_prot/hispanic, etc., and/or using the wrong dataset/wave.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.159 / 0.101**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Match the sample and variable construction first.

---

## 2) Variable inclusion & naming: “no_religion” improperly dropped; likely wrong construction for others

### “no_religion” is incorrectly excluded
- Generated:
  - Model 2: `no_religion` **dropped** (“no_variation(n_unique=1)”)
  - Model 3: `no_religion` **dropped**
- True:
  - Model 2 includes **No religion** (β = **-0.012**)
  - Model 3 includes **No religion** (β = **0.024**)

**What this means:** your `no_religion` variable is constant (all 0s or all 1s) *in the estimation sample*, which is almost certainly a coding/filtering bug.

**Fix:**
1. Recreate `no_religion` from the correct source question (typically “religious preference” or “none” category).
2. Verify coding before modeling:
   - Check value counts **before listwise deletion** and **within the final model frame**.
3. Ensure you are not subsetting to only religious respondents (which would make “none” impossible) or inadvertently recoding missing to a single category.

---

## 3) Standardized coefficients (betas): widespread coefficient mismatches

The **True table reports standardized coefficients**. Your `beta_std` values should match those. They do not.

### Model 1 (SES): β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.332*** | **-0.322*** | slightly off |
| Income pc | **-0.034** | **-0.037** | slightly off |
| Occ prestige | **0.029** | **0.016** | materially off |

**Fix:** Once you match **N=787** and variable coding (especially prestige), these should converge. The prestige mismatch suggests either:
- different prestige variable (e.g., wrong year/version like `prestg80` vs another prestige measure), or
- different handling of prestige missing values, or
- not actually standardizing the same way as the paper.

### Model 2 (Demographic): β mismatches (many)
| Variable | Generated β | True β |
|---|---:|---:|
| Education | **-0.327*** | **-0.246*** |
| Income pc | **-0.022** | **-0.054** |
| Occ prestige | **0.014** | **-0.006** |
| Female | **-0.062** | **-0.083***? (printed: -0.083*) |
| Age | **0.109** | **0.140*** |
| Black | **0.050** | **0.029** |
| Hispanic | **-0.022** | **-0.029** |
| Other race | **0.005** | **0.005** (matches) |
| Conserv Prot | **0.076** | **0.059** |
| No religion | **dropped** | **-0.012** |
| Southern | **0.142** ** | **0.097** ** |

**Fixes (in priority order):**
1. **Get N to 756** (your N=306 indicates your model is estimated on a very different subset).
2. Ensure the dependent variable matches exactly: “Number of music genres disliked”. Your outputs show `exclusiveness` as outcome; that might be the right construct, but if it’s not exactly the same operationalization (or scaling), betas and constants will diverge.
3. Rebuild `hispanic`, `conserv_prot`, `no_religion` so they match the authors’ coding and don’t generate massive missingness.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): β mismatches + wrong stars
| Variable | Generated β | True β |
|---|---:|---:|
| Education | **-0.091** | **-0.151** ** |
| Income pc | **-0.054** | **-0.009** |
| Occ prestige | **0.005** | **-0.022** |
| Female | **-0.075** | **-0.095*** |
| Age | **0.143** | **0.110*** |
| Black | **0.146** | **0.049** |
| Hispanic | **0.016** | **0.031** |
| Other race | **0.084** | **0.053** |
| Conserv Prot | **-0.005** | **0.066** |
| No religion | **dropped** | **0.024** |
| Southern | **0.139** (no ** in your table1) | **0.121** ** |
| Pol intolerance | **0.200***? (your beta 0.200* in long table) | **0.164*** |

**Fixes:**
- Same: match sample (N should be 503, not 171), match coding, and ensure the intolerance scale is the same.
- Your `beta_std` for political intolerance is **0.200**, but true is **0.164**—that’s too large to be rounding; it’s likely a different measure/scale or different sample.

---

## 4) Missingness diagnostics reveal why your N collapses (and why coefficients differ)

Your missingness tables show extremely high missingness for key predictors:

- `conserv_prot` missing **333 (37.3%)**
- `hispanic` missing **281 (31.5%)**
- `polintol` missing **402 (45.0%)**

Those rates can happen, but the **True N** (756 and 503) implies the authors did **not** lose that many cases, meaning at least one of these is true:

### Likely problems
1. **You coded “not asked / inapplicable” as NA**, but the authors treated it as a valid category (e.g., 0 = not conservative Protestant; 0 = not Hispanic).
2. **You created these variables from the wrong source fields** (different wave/module), so they are missing for many respondents.
3. **You used listwise deletion across variables that are not in the authors’ model frame** (e.g., you computed intermediate variables and kept their missings attached to the modeling data).

### Fix
- For binary indicators like `hispanic`, `black`, `female`, `south`, `conserv_prot`:
  - Ensure they’re coded **0/1** with minimal missingness, and that “No” is **0**, not NA.
- For `polintol`:
  - Verify you are using the same items and the same aggregation rule as the paper (mean/sum, required non-missing items, etc.).
  - If the paper uses scale scoring with partial completion allowed, replicate that rule instead of requiring complete data.

---

## 5) Constants (intercepts) are wrong in all models

- True constants: **10.920**, **8.507**, **6.516**
- Generated constants: **11.086**, **9.809**, **5.085**

These are not “small rounding” differences; they indicate different:
- samples,
- dependent variable scaling/centering,
- and/or predictor coding.

**Fix:** Once you (a) match the dependent variable exactly and (b) match sample + coding, intercepts should align. Note that intercepts are sensitive to coding of 0/1 dummies and scaling.

---

## 6) Significance / interpretation mismatches (stars don’t match)

Because your **coefficients and N are wrong**, p-values and stars will differ. But there are also two specific reporting issues:

### A) Political intolerance significance
- True: **0.164*** (p < .001)
- Generated: `polintol` beta **0.200** with p = **0.0116** (*)
- **Fix:** This is a strong signal you are **not estimating the same model/sample/measure**. With N=171 you have far less power than with N=503, inflating SEs and weakening significance.

### B) Southern in Model 3
- True: **0.121** ** (p < .01)
- Generated: beta **0.139** with p = **0.0697** (no **)
- **Fix:** Again consistent with N collapse and/or different coding.

---

## 7) Standard errors: your generated output implies SEs exist, but the True table does not report them

- True note: **Table 1 reports standardized coefficients only and does not print SEs**.
- Generated: you did not explicitly print SEs in the excerpted coefficient table, but you *did* compute p-values from SEs and show significance stars.

**Mismatch in reporting/interpretation:**
- You cannot claim your SEs “match Table 1” because **Table 1 has no SEs**.
- **Fix:** To match the PDF table, output **standardized betas only** (and stars if you want), and remove claims about matching SEs unless you have them from another table/appendix.

---

## 8) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Confirm the dependent variable**
   - Must be exactly “Number of music genres disliked” (same coding, range, handling of “don’t know”, etc.).
   - If your `exclusiveness` is a derived index, verify it is identical to the paper’s DV.

2. **Rebuild predictors to match paper coding**
   - `educ`: same scale (years? degree categories transformed to years?).
   - `inc_pc`: same transformation (raw dollars vs logged vs equivalized). Your coefficient naming suggests per-capita income, but confirm the paper.
   - `prestg80`: ensure it’s the same prestige measure (and same occupation coding).
   - `conserv_prot`, `no_religion`: derive from the same religion variable and same denominators.
   - `south`: same region definition.
   - `polintol`: same items and scale scoring.

3. **Fix binary-variable missingness**
   - Ensure “No” is coded 0, not NA.
   - Avoid wave/module missingness by using the correct dataset that contains those items for the relevant respondents.

4. **Match the estimation sample per model**
   - Aim for **N=787**, **756**, **503** respectively.
   - Use listwise deletion **only on variables in that model**, nothing extra.

5. **Standardize exactly as Table 1**
   - Use standardized coefficients comparable to the paper:
     - Either z-score all variables (including DV) before OLS, or use a standardization procedure equivalent to the authors’.
   - Confirm whether the paper standardizes with sample SDs from the model sample.

6. **Then verify targets**
   - Betas should match the true ones to rounding.
   - R²/Adj R² and constants should align once sample and coding are correct.

---

If you share (a) the code that constructs `no_religion`, `conserv_prot`, `hispanic`, and `polintol`, and (b) how `exclusiveness` is computed, I can pinpoint exactly which recode/merge step is causing the N collapse and the beta/significance reversals.
