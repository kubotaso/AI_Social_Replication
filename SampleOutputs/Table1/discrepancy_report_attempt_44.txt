Below is a complete, line-by-line reconciliation of the **Generated Results** vs the **True Results (Table 1 in the PDF)**, focusing on **(a) variable names**, **(b) standardized coefficients**, **(c) standard errors**, and **(d) interpretation / model fit and N**—plus exactly what to change so the generated output matches the printed table.

---

## 0) Critical framing mismatch: SEs should not be shown at all
**True Results:** Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only** and **does not print standard errors**.

**Generated Results:** `table1_style` appears to show each coefficient on one row and then a second row beneath that looks like an SE line—but the numbers are not in parentheses and don’t match anything in the true table. This is a structural mismatch, not just a numeric one.

**Fix**
- Remove SEs entirely from the display (or mark them as “not available in PDF”).
- If you *must* compute SEs from data, you can report them, but then you must label the table as “replication (computed SEs)” and it still won’t “match Table 1” because Table 1 omits SEs.

---

## 1) Variable naming mismatches (table labeling)
These are mostly “internal code names” vs “printed names.”

### SES variables
- Generated: `educ` → True: **Education**
- Generated: `income_pc` → True: **Household income per capita**
- Generated: `prestg80` → True: **Occupational prestige**

### Demographics / other predictors
- Generated: `female` → True: **Female**
- Generated: `age` → True: **Age**
- Generated: `black` → True: **Black**
- Generated: `hispanic` → True: **Hispanic**
- Generated: `other_race` → True: **Other race**
- Generated: `conservative_protestant` → True: **Conservative Protestant**
- Generated: `no_religion` → True: **No religion**
- Generated: `southern` → True: **Southern**
- Generated: `political_intolerance` → True: **Political intolerance**

**Fix**
- Add a label map when rendering the table so the printed variable names exactly match Table 1.
- Ensure the DV label matches exactly (you already have it right: “Number of music genres disliked”).

---

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas): every difference
The true table is standardized coefficients. Your generated `beta_std` values are close but not equal, meaning the replication pipeline is not matching the original study’s exact construction (sample, coding, weights, or standardization method).

### Model 1 (SES) — mismatches

| Southern | 0.085* | 0.097** | too small; sig differs |
| Constant | 8.807 | 8.507 | too high by 0.300 |
| R² | 0.1455 | 0.151 | too low by 0.0055 |
| Adj R² | 0.1328 | 0.139 | too low by 0.0062 |
| N | 756 | 756 | matches |

### Model 3 (Political intolerance) — mismatches
| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.155** | -0.151** | slightly too negative |
| Income per capita | -0.016 | -0.009 | too negative |
| Occupational prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | too close to zero |
| Female | -0.116* | -0.095* | too negative |
| Age | 0.060 | 0.110* | far too small; sig differs |
| Black | -0.009 | 0.049 | sign flip |
| Hispanic | 0.086 | 0.031 | too large |
| Other race | 0.052 | 0.053 | basically matches |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.051 | 0.066 | too small |
| No religion | 0.017 | 0.024 | too small |
| Southern | 0.091 | 0.121** | too small; sig differs |
| Political intolerance | 0.173*** | 0.164*** | too large by 0.009 |
| Constant | 7.259 | 6.516 | too high by 0.743 |
| R² | 0.1431 | 0.169 | **too low by 0.0259** |
| Adj R² | 0.1182 | 0.148 | too low by 0.0298 |
| N | 426 | 503 | **-77 cases** |

## 3) Standard errors: not just mismatched—conceptually wrong relative to “True Results”
**True Results:** SEs are *not available* from Table 1.  
**Generated table:** includes a second line of numbers under each coefficient that look like SEs but are not labeled as such, and can’t be validated against the PDF.

**Fix options**
1) **To match Table 1:** remove SEs entirely.
2) **If reporting computed SEs anyway:** put them in parentheses and explicitly label:  
   “Standard errors computed from replication data; not shown in original Table 1.”

---

## 4) Sample size / listwise deletion mismatches are a major cause (and they affect coefficients + R²)
Two models have large N mismatches:

- **Model 1:** Generated N=758 vs True N=787 (missing 29)
- **Model 3:** Generated N=426 vs True N=503 (missing 77)

Your own diagnostics show heavy missingness on political intolerance:
- `political_intolerance` nonmissing in DV-complete = **491** (already below 503)
- Then listwise N for Model 3 drops to **426**

This is a smoking gun: your constructed variable and/or filter differs from the original.

**Fix**
- Recreate the *exact* analytic sample rules used in the paper/PDF:
  - same survey year/wave restriction(s)
  - same inclusion criteria
  - same handling of “don’t know,” “refused,” “not asked,” and skip patterns
  - same missing-data rule (listwise vs pairwise vs imputation)
- Specifically for Model 3, you likely recoded political intolerance too aggressively to missing (or used items not available for all respondents).
  - Check whether the original index was computed when *at least k items* were present (e.g., mean of available items) rather than complete-case across all items.

---

## 5) Standardization procedure mismatch (another likely cause of coefficient differences)
Because Table 1 is **standardized betas**, you must replicate *their* standardization convention.

Common sources of mismatch:
- Standardizing using the **model’s estimation sample** vs standardizing in the **full sample**
- Standardizing **after** transformations (e.g., logged income) vs before
- Using **survey weights** (weighted means/SDs) vs unweighted
- Treating binary variables in special ways (some authors standardize y only, or report “y-standardized” coefficients)

**Fix**
- Verify and match the exact approach:
  1. Confirm whether they report **fully standardized** betas (both X and Y standardized) or only X-standardized.
  2. Standardize variables using the **same sample as the model** (most typical for regression betas).
  3. If the original used weights, compute weighted SDs/means and fit weighted OLS.

---

## 6) Interpretation/significance mismatches are downstream of coefficient/sample mismatches
Because your coefficients differ, your inferred significance stars differ too (e.g., Female and Southern in Model 2; Age/Black/Southern in Model 3).

But there’s an additional issue:

- Your stars come from your computed p-values.
- The true stars are as printed in the PDF and may reflect:
  - different N (hence different SEs)
  - weights/design effects
  - slightly different variable constructions

**Fix**
- Once sample + variable construction + weighting match, recompute p-values and apply the PDF’s thresholds (*, **, ***).
- If you are trying to match the PDF *exactly*, don’t “recompute” stars from a different pipeline—match the pipeline first.

---

## 7) Constant and R² mismatches indicate the model is not the same specification/sample
Constants differ in all models (especially Model 3), and R² in Model 3 is much lower than true (0.143 vs 0.169). That is consistent with:
- different sample,
- different coding of predictors,
- and/or different DV construction.

**Fix**
- Confirm DV is identical (range, handling of “not asked,” etc.).
- Ensure the same set of predictors and same coding (especially race/ethnicity and region).
- Ensure same estimation method (OLS, weights, any robust SEs don’t change R² but weights can).

---

## What you should change to make “generated analysis” match Table 1
In priority order:

1) **Match the analytic N**
   - Reproduce the paper’s inclusion/exclusion rules so you get **N=787, 756, 503**.

2) **Rebuild `political_intolerance` exactly**
   - Use the same items, same scaling, same missing-data rule for index construction.
   - Your current construction yields too many missings (402 missing among DV-complete).

3) **Apply the same weighting/design (if used)**
   - If the study used survey weights, fit weighted OLS and compute standardized betas accordingly.

4) **Standardize exactly as the authors did**
   - Ensure you’re producing the same notion of “standardized coefficient” as in the PDF.

5) **Fix table output to mirror the PDF**
   - Show standardized coefficients only; remove SE rows; keep constants, R², Adj R², N.

If you want, paste (a) your code that constructs `political_intolerance`, (b) any filters (year, age restrictions, etc.), and (c) whether you used weights; I can pinpoint the exact step(s) causing the N and sign flips (e.g., Hispanic, prestige) and prescribe the minimal code edits.
