Score: 35/100
============================================================

Below is a full audit of **every mismatch** between the Generated Results and the True Results (Table 1), grouped by: (A) fit statistics / sample size, (B) variable names & model specification, (C) coefficients & stars, (D) constants, and (E) interpretation/reporting. For each discrepancy I explain **how to fix it so the generated analysis reproduces the table**.

---

## A) Fit statistics and N (major mismatches)

### Model 1
- **N mismatch:** Generated **747** vs True **787** (−40 cases)
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.0883** vs True **0.107**
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.0846** vs True **0.104**

**Fix:**
1. **Use the same inclusion rules as the paper** for complete cases. Your “model_frames” shows listwise deletion on `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, and `num_genres_disliked`. The paper’s N=787 implies **less missingness (or different handling)** than your constructed variables.
2. In particular, your missingness table shows huge missingness on the DV (`num_genres_disliked` missing 44%). That strongly suggests your DV construction differs from the paper (see Section B/E).
3. Recreate the DV and SES variables exactly per the paper’s coding, *then* do listwise deletion. If you must impute/retain, it must match what the authors did (most likely **not** imputation; more likely your DV/merge/filtering is wrong).

### Model 2
- **N mismatch:** Generated **507** vs True **756**
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.1387** vs True **0.151**
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.1196** vs True **0.139**

**Fix:**
- Same root issue: your analysis is discarding far more cases, likely because one or more added demographic variables (race/region/religion) are coded with extra missingness or are derived incorrectly.
- Ensure dummy variables are built to match the paper (reference categories and valid values), and avoid introducing missing values by recoding errors (e.g., treating “inapplicable” as missing when the paper treats it as a category or excludes a different universe).

### Model 3
- **N mismatch:** Generated **334** vs True **503**
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.1422** vs True **0.169**
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.1101** vs True **0.148**

**Fix:**
- Your `pol_intol` has **36% missing**, and the model frame drops to 334. The paper gets 503, so either:
  1) your intolerance scale is built from the wrong items / wrong universe, or  
  2) you are coding “don’t know/refused/not asked” as missing when the paper had more usable responses, or  
  3) you restricted the sample (e.g., by accidentally filtering) beyond the paper.

---

## B) Variable names/specification mismatches

### 1) DV naming vs table concept
- Generated DV: `num_genres_disliked`
- True DV: “Number of Music Genres Disliked” (same concept)

**But the *pattern of N and R²* indicates your DV is likely not constructed identically.**

**Fix:**
- Rebuild the DV from the exact GSS 1993 items and the same counting rule as the paper (e.g., which genres included, whether “don’t like” vs “strongly dislike,” how missing/NA handled per item, whether “not asked” items are excluded vs treated as 0, etc.). A common source of massive DV missingness is requiring nonmissing on *all* genre items instead of counting across available items appropriately.

### 2) Political intolerance scale range mismatch
- Generated label: **“Political intolerance (0–15)”**
- True table: **Political intolerance** (no range shown)

Your `pol_intol` in model3_frame shows values like 0–7; label says 0–15. That inconsistency signals the scale construction is uncertain.

**Fix:**
- Confirm the paper’s intolerance scale composition (likely sum across multiple items). Ensure:
  - correct items
  - correct direction (higher = more intolerance)
  - correct minimum/maximum
  - correct handling of missing items (sum only if enough items present vs require all items)

### 3) Race dummies / reference category likely wrong
Compare True vs Generated (Model 2/3):
- **Other race sign differs** (see Section C). That often happens when:
  - reference group differs (e.g., white vs nonblack nonhispanic), or
  - “Hispanic” is not treated mutually exclusive with race, or
  - dummies were created from overlapping indicators.

**Fix:**
- Implement race/ethnicity the same way as the paper. Typically Table 1 implies mutually exclusive categories:
  - Black, Hispanic, Other race dummies
  - Reference = White non-Hispanic
- Ensure “Hispanic” is not simultaneously counted as white/black in the race variable, unless paper did so (unlikely given separate Hispanic dummy).

## C) Coefficient (β) mismatches variable-by-variable

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292 | -0.322 | magnitude too small |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | close (minor) |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | slightly high |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | too low |
| R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | too low |

**Fix:**
- Main issue is **data/case selection and/or variable coding**. Because the differences are systematic (R² and constant also off), this is not a rounding issue.
- After fixing the DV and N, re-check standardization approach: Table uses standardized coefficients β. Your output appears to compute β (standardized slopes) but the discrepancies indicate either:
  - you standardized using a different sample (because of missingness), or
  - you standardized differently (e.g., standardizing after residualizing / using population weights, etc.).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265 | -0.246 | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | slightly off |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | off |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close |
| **Age** | **0.103***? (actually only * in your table) | **0.140*** | too small + wrong stars |
| **Black** | **0.100** | **0.029** | big mismatch |
| **Hispanic** | **-0.074** | **-0.029** | mismatch |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **0.005** | sign mismatch |
| Cons Prot | 0.087 | 0.059 | mismatch |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | close |
| **Southern** | **0.061 (ns)** | **0.097** ** | too small + wrong stars |
| Constant | 9.609 | 8.507 | too high |
| R² | 0.139 | 0.151 | low |

**Fix:**
- The very large differences for race/region suggest **coding/specification differences**, not sampling noise:
  1) Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies with the correct reference group and mutual exclusivity.
  2) Ensure `south` is coded as in the paper (likely Census South vs non-South). If you used a different region variable or coding, the coefficient and significance will change.
  3) Age: confirm scaling (years vs decades) and whether centered/standardized correctly before computing β.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.144* | -0.151** | small difference + stars differ |
| **Income pc** | **-0.062** | **-0.009** | big mismatch |
| **Prestige** | **0.008** | **-0.022** | sign mismatch |
| Female | -0.122* | -0.095* | mismatch |
| **Age** | **0.079 (ns)** | **0.110*** | mismatch + stars |
| Black | 0.122 | 0.049 | mismatch |
| **Hispanic** | **-0.052** | **0.031** | sign mismatch |
| Other race | 0.035 | 0.053 | mismatch |
| Cons Prot | 0.053 | 0.066 | mismatch |
| No religion | 0.027 | 0.024 | close |
| **Southern** | **0.070 (ns)** | **0.121** ** | mismatch + stars |
| **Political intolerance** | **0.197*** | **0.164*** | too large |
| Constant | 7.125 | 6.516 | too high |
| R² | 0.142 | 0.169 | too low |

**Fix:**
- Again, the pattern points to **wrong sample and/or wrong scale construction** for `pol_intol` plus wrong coding of SES and race variables.
- Your `pol_intol` distribution and missingness need to match the paper; otherwise both its coefficient and the remaining coefficients will shift.
- Income and prestige flipping relative to True results is a red flag for:
  - different variable definitions (e.g., income not per capita, prestige not `prestg80`)
  - standardization done incorrectly (e.g., standardizing *including zeros from imputation-like recodes*)
  - heavy selection bias from listwise deletion on `pol_intol` (your N collapses to 334)

---

## D) Standard errors and significance: mismatches in reporting/interpretation

### 1) Standard errors
- **Generated output reports p-values and implies SE exist**, but **True Table 1 does not report SE at all**.

**Fix:**
- If your goal is to “match Table 1,” you should not present SE/p-values as if they were in the table. Do:
  - show β and stars only (and constant), matching the paper, or
  - if you compute p-values yourself, clearly label them as *recomputed from microdata* and expect they may not match authors’ stars unless all details match (weights, design effects, exact sample, etc.).

### 2) Significance stars mismatches (examples)
- Model 2 Age: Generated `*` (p≈0.019) vs True `***`
- Model 2 Southern: Generated ns (p≈0.161) vs True `**`
- Model 3 Education: Generated `*` vs True `**`
- Model 3 Age: Generated ns vs True `*`
- Model 3 Southern: Generated ns vs True `**`

**Fix:**
- Stars won’t match until **(i)** N and variables match and **(ii)** you use the same inference approach as the paper:
  - Did the paper use **weights**? (GSS analyses often do.)
  - Did it use **robust SEs** or design-corrected SEs? (cluster/strata)  
If you used plain OLS SEs, stars can differ even with same β.

---

## E) Interpretation issues in the generated analysis

### 1) Confusing “const_b” vs “beta”
Your tables show `const_b` as `NaN` for all non-constant terms and `beta` as the coefficient. That’s fine internally, but it becomes an interpretation risk: readers may think NaN means missing estimates.

**Fix:**
- Output a single “Coefficient (β)” column for standardized slopes and a separate “Constant (b)” row, matching the paper layout.

### 2) Inconsistent labeling of Political intolerance
Label says “0–15” but observed values appear lower; plus True table doesn’t specify range.

**Fix:**
- Remove the range label unless verified from the actual construction; otherwise you’re asserting a scale that may not match the authors’.

---

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches the True Table 1

1. **Reconstruct the DV exactly** as in the paper (this is likely the biggest driver of N/R² differences). Your DV missingness (44%) is far too high to reproduce the table Ns.
2. **Recreate `pol_intol` exactly** (items, scoring, and missing-data rule) to get N≈503 in Model 3 and β≈0.164***.
3. **Match sample restrictions to GSS 1993** and the paper’s universe (age limits? valid respondents? music module eligibility?). Any unintended filtering will distort N and coefficients.
4. **Recode race/ethnicity dummies to match the reference category and mutual exclusivity** implied by the table. This is needed to fix the sign/size mismatches for Hispanic/Other race.
5. **Use the same weighting and SE method** as the authors (if they did). If Table 1 stars are based on weighted/design-based SEs, your p-values/stars from unweighted OLS won’t match.
6. **Standardize coefficients the same way**: β should be based on the analytic sample of each model (after listwise deletion), and computed as standardized slopes (not partially standardized, not standardized using full-sample SDs).

If you paste your code for constructing (i) `num_genres_disliked`, (ii) `inc_pc`, (iii) race/ethnicity, and (iv) `pol_intol`, I can point to the exact lines that are causing the N collapse and the sign flips, and specify the precise recodes needed to match Table 1.
