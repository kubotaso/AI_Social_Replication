Score: 17/100
============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics: **n, R², adjusted R², and “dropped”**
### Mismatches
- **Sample size (n) is wrong in every model**
  - Generated: **M1 n=747**, **M2 n=271**, **M3 n=152**
  - True: **M1 n=787**, **M2 n=756**, **M3 n=503**
- **R² and adjusted R² don’t match**
  - Model 1: generated **R²=.088** (adj .085) vs true **R²=.107** (adj .104)
  - Model 2: generated **R²=.152** (adj .120) vs true **R²=.151** (adj .139)
  - Model 3: generated **R²=.178** (adj .114) vs true **R²=.169** (adj .148)
- **“dropped [norelig]” is a major discrepancy**
  - True Models 2–3 include **No religion** as a predictor and report its coefficient.
  - Generated says it was dropped (and indeed it’s absent from coefficient tables).

### How to fix
- **Do not listwise-delete the whole model on variables like `hispanic`, `cons_prot`, `pol_intol` if that’s not what the paper did**, or you won’t reproduce the paper’s n’s.
- Concretely, your missingness table shows huge missingness for:
  - `hispanic` (35%), `cons_prot` (42%), `num_genres_disliked` (44%), `pol_intol` (47%).
  Those rates are incompatible with the paper’s large n (e.g., 756, 503) unless:
  - you’re using the **wrong source variables**, **wrong wave**, or **wrong coding**, or
  - the paper used a different constructed DV/IV with far fewer missing values, or
  - you accidentally turned nonresponse codes into NA (see below).
- **Ensure `norelig` is included in Models 2–3** and is not collinear with the religion dummy you already have.
  - If you have `cons_prot` plus `norelig`, you also need a **clear reference category** (e.g., “other religion”) and you must avoid the dummy-variable trap.

---

## 2) Variable names / included predictors: **structure doesn’t match**
### Mismatches
- Generated includes **“Conservative Protestant”** and **“Southern”**, but the raw variables listed in missingness are `cons_prot` and `south`. That’s fine as labeling, but:
- **“No religion” is missing** from Models 2 and 3 in generated output, but present in the true table.
- Generated Models 2–3 appear to include all demographics except `norelig` (dropped), contradicting the true model specification.

### How to fix
- In model formulas, explicitly include `norelig`:
  - Model 2: `... + cons_prot + norelig + south`
  - Model 3: `... + cons_prot + norelig + south + pol_intol`
- Check coding so that `norelig` isn’t perfectly determined by other religion dummies. If you have multiple religion dummies, you must omit one category as the reference.

## 3) Coefficients: **you’re mixing unstandardized b and standardized β, and your β’s don’t match**
The true table reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (and unstandardized constants). Your generated tables include both **b** and **beta**, but comparisons to the paper must be against **beta**, not **b** (except constants).

### Model 1 (SES)
**True β vs generated β**
- Education: true **-0.322*** vs generated **-0.292*** → mismatch in magnitude
- Income: true **-0.037** vs generated **-0.039** → close (but still not exact)
- Prestige: true **0.016** vs generated **0.020** → mismatch
**Constant**
- True constant **10.920** vs generated **10.638** → mismatch

**Fix**
- Ensure you compute **standardized coefficients the same way as the paper**:
  - Standardize **all predictors and the DV** before OLS, *or* compute β from unstandardized b using SD ratios.
- Make sure the DV is the same construction as the paper’s “Number of music genres disliked” (range and inclusion rules matter a lot).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
**True β vs generated β (selected)**
- Education: **-0.246*** (true) vs **-0.284*** (gen) → mismatch
- Income: **-0.054** vs **-0.021** → mismatch
- Prestige: **-0.006** vs **0.011** → sign mismatch
- Female: **-0.083***? (true shows -0.083*), vs **-0.080** (gen) → magnitude close, but **significance differs**
- Age: **0.140*** vs **0.085** → mismatch
- Black: **0.029** vs **0.113** → mismatch
- Southern: **0.097** (true is **0.097** and **\*\***), vs **0.123** (gen, * only) → mismatch
**Constant**
- True **8.507** vs gen **9.492** → mismatch

**Fix**
- Biggest issue is **your sample is n=271**, which will radically change coefficients. Fixing the **case selection / missing-data handling** to match the paper is prerequisite.
- After n matches, re-check:
  - race dummies coding (Black/Hispanic/Other race) and reference group
  - whether age is in years (you have `age_v` with 72 unique values—ok) but confirm same scaling
  - whether “female” is coded 1=female (and not reversed)

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
**True β vs generated β (selected)**
- Political intolerance: true **0.164*** vs gen **0.129** (p=.137) → mismatch in size and significance
- Education: true **-0.151** vs gen **-0.083** → mismatch
- Female: true **-0.095*** vs gen **-0.103** (p=.196) → sign/magnitude similar but significance mismatch
- Age: true **0.110*** (actually true table has 0.110*) vs gen **0.146** (p=.087) → mismatch in significance
- Southern: true **0.121** **\*\*** vs gen **0.147** (p=.070) → mismatch
**Constant**
- True **6.516** vs gen **5.439** → mismatch

**Fix**
- Again, your **n=152** vs true **503** is likely the dominant cause.
- Ensure `pol_intol` is coded on the same **0–15** scale as the paper (you label it 0–15, but your missingness shows only **16 unique values**; check if it’s truly 0–15 or collapsed/top-coded).
- Verify you are using the **same year/wave (GSS 1993)** and same political intolerance items and aggregation.

---

## 4) Standard errors: you reported p-values, but the “true” table reports **no SE**
### Mismatch
- User asked to compare **standard errors**, but your generated tables **do not show SE**, only p-values.
- The true table explicitly says **SE not reported**.

### How to fix
- If the goal is to match the paper’s presentation: **remove SE and p-values** from the “generated” comparison table and show **β with stars** (and constants unstandardized).
- If the goal is to compute SE anyway: add an SE column, but then you **can’t** compare it to the published table—only to your own replication output.

---

## 5) Significance stars / interpretation: several don’t match the true pattern
### Mismatches
- Model 2:
  - True: **Female -0.083*** (p<.05) but generated p=.175 (ns)
  - True: **Age 0.140*** but generated p=.168 (ns)
  - True: **Southern 0.097\*\*** but generated p=.036 (*)
- Model 3:
  - True: **Political intolerance 0.164*** but generated p=.137 (ns)
  - True: **Education -0.151\*\*** but generated p=.415 (ns)
  - True: **Southern 0.121\*\*** but generated p=.070 (ns)

### Fix
- Significance mismatches will largely resolve once:
  1) **the sample size matches** the paper, and  
  2) you’re using the **same DV/IV construction and coding**, and  
  3) you’re using **standardized coefficients** to compare to Table 1.

---

## 6) The missingness table strongly suggests **coding/extraction errors**
### Key red flags
- DV `num_genres_disliked` has **44% missing** (713/1606).
- `pol_intol` has **47% missing**.
- `cons_prot` has **42% missing**.
- `hispanic` has **35% missing**, while `black/female/south` have 0% missing.

In GSS-style data, race/sex/region typically have near-complete data, but “Hispanic” often depends on year/derived variables—still, 35–47% missing across multiple core predictors is a sign you may be:
- using **a variable not asked in 1993** for many respondents,
- using the wrong **subset (e.g., only a ballot form)** without accounting for it,
- or recoding GSS special codes (e.g., DK/NA/Refused/Not applicable) into NA differently than the paper.

### Fix
- Verify the exact variables used in the paper and how they were constructed.
- Recode GSS missing-value codes correctly (common ones: 8/9, 98/99, 998/999, etc., vary by variable).
- Confirm you are filtering to the correct universe (e.g., only those asked the music module, only those with valid DV), *then* fit models.

## Summary of “must-change” items to make generated match true
1. **Include `norelig` in Models 2–3** (do not drop it).
2. **Fix case selection / missing-data handling** so n matches: 787 / 756 / 503.
3. Compare to the paper using **standardized β coefficients** (and unstandardized constants).
4. Ensure **identical coding and reference categories** for race/religion/region and identical scaling for `pol_intol`.
5. Align output format: Table 1 has **no SE**; show β + stars (and constants, R², adj R², n).

If you share your exact model formulas and the recodes for (a) DV genres disliked, (b) political intolerance, and (c) religion dummies (including reference group), I can point to the specific line(s) causing the n collapse and the `norelig` drop.
