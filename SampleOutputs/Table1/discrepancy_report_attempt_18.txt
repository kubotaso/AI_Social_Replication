### 1) Variable-name mismatches (and table labeling problems)

**Mismatch: DV labeling**
- **Generated**: Model headers are “Model 1 (SES) / Model 2 (Demographic) / Model 3 (Political intolerance)” but the dependent variable is never printed in the generated table; also “Model 3 (Political intolerance)” is ambiguous (it could be read as DV).
- **True**: DV is explicitly *Number of music genres disliked* for all models; Model 3 is *Political Intolerance Model* (i.e., adds political intolerance as a predictor).

**Fix**
- Add a caption/subtitle stating the DV.
- Rename Model 3 header to something like **“Model 3 (Political Intolerance predictor)”** or **“Political Intolerance Model”**.

**Mismatch: variable names don’t match Table 1 names**
- **Generated term names**: `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`.
- **True table names**: “Education”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, “Female”, etc.

**Fix**
- Map internal names to printed labels in the output table (keep internal names in code, but print the Table 1 labels). E.g.  
  - `educ` → **Education**  
  - `income_pc` → **Household income per capita**  
  - `prestg80` → **Occupational prestige**  
  - etc.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients**. Your generated table’s main coefficient entries appear to be standardized (they match `beta_std`), so compare `beta_std` to the true standardized values. Every mismatch below is a discrepancy.

#### Model 1 (SES): all three coefficients differ
| Variable | Generated βstd | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332 | -0.322 | too negative |
| HH income pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | too small in magnitude |
| Occupational prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | too large |

Also:
- **Constant**: generated 11.086 vs true 10.920 (mismatch)
- **R² / Adj R²**: generated 0.109 / 0.105 vs true 0.107 / 0.104 (mismatch)
- **N**: generated 758 vs true 787 (mismatch)

#### Model 2 (Demographic): many coefficients differ
| Variable | Generated βstd | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.260 | -0.246 | too negative |
| HH income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | too small in magnitude |
| Occupational prestige | 0.007 | -0.006 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.090 | -0.083 | too negative |
| Age | 0.129 | 0.140 | too small |
| Black | 0.004 | 0.029 | far too small |
| Hispanic | 0.034 | -0.029 | wrong sign |
| Other race | 0.001 | 0.005 | too small |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.065 | 0.059 | slightly too big |
| No religion | -0.005 | -0.012 | too small in magnitude |
| Southern | 0.085 | 0.097 | too small |

Also:
- **Constant**: 8.807 vs 8.507 (mismatch)
- **R² / Adj R²**: 0.145 / 0.133 vs 0.151 / 0.139 (mismatch)
- **N**: 756 matches true 756 (OK)

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance model): most coefficients differ
| Variable | Generated βstd | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.136 | -0.151 | too small in magnitude |
| HH income pc | -0.031 | -0.009 | far too negative |
| Occupational prestige | -0.003 | -0.022 | too small in magnitude |
| Female | -0.112 | -0.095 | too negative |
| Age | 0.094 | 0.110 | too small |
| Black | 0.012 | 0.049 | too small |
| Hispanic | 0.065 | 0.031 | too large |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.053 | slightly too small |
| Cons Prot | 0.058 | 0.066 | too small |
| No religion | 0.017 | 0.024 | too small |
| Southern | 0.091 | 0.121 | too small |
| Political intolerance | 0.188 | 0.164 | too large |

Also:
- **Constant**: 6.507 vs 6.516 (small mismatch)
- **R² / Adj R²**: 0.152 / 0.131 vs 0.169 / 0.148 (mismatch)
- **N**: 508 vs 503 (mismatch)

**How to fix coefficient mismatches**
These gaps strongly suggest you are **not estimating the exact same model/specification/sample** as the published Table 1. To make the generated coefficients match the PDF:

1. **Use the exact same sample restrictions as the article.**  
   Your diagnostics show you’re effectively working from a subset (e.g., `N_year_1993 = 1606`, `N_complete_music_18 = 893`) and then doing listwise deletion down to 758/756/508. The published table uses **787/756/503**.  
   - Model 2 matches N=756, but Models 1 and 3 don’t—so the published authors used *different missing-data handling and/or different inclusion rules per model* than you did.

2. **Replicate their missing-data rule exactly.**  
   Likely culprits:
   - Different handling of DK/NA/refused codes (e.g., recoding them vs treating as missing).
   - Different construction of per-capita income (e.g., using household size; trimming; logging; top-coding).
   - Different construction of the “political intolerance” scale and the inclusion rule (your code shows a “min answered rule=10” and mean answered ~9.77, which is internally inconsistent; plus you have 508 complete cases but they have 503).

3. **Confirm you are using the same variable operationalizations/codings.**  
   Sign flips (e.g., Hispanic in Model 2; prestige in Model 2) often come from:
   - different reference categories (e.g., race dummies coded differently),
   - accidentally including multiple overlapping dummies,
   - or coding a category as 1 when it should be 0 (or vice versa).

4. **Standardization must match theirs.**  
   Table 1 uses standardized coefficients. To replicate:
   - Standardize **both** DV and all continuous predictors (and keep 0/1 dummies as-is or also standardize—authors differ).  
   If your standardization choice differs from theirs (especially for binary indicators), betas will differ. Decide what the paper did and reproduce it.

### 3) Standard errors: the generated output is fundamentally incompatible with “true” Table 1

**Mismatch**
- **Generated**: table prints a second row per coefficient that looks like standard errors (e.g., under -0.332*** there is “-0.034”, etc.), but these are *not* standard errors (they’re other coefficients spilling into the wrong row layout). Also `table1_style` doesn’t label SEs.
- **True**: Table 1 explicitly **does not print standard errors at all**; only standardized coefficients are reported.

**Fix**
- Remove standard errors from the “matching-to-Table-1” output entirely.
- If you want SEs for your own appendix table, label them clearly and do **not** claim they match Table 1.

Concretely: change the table generator to **one row per variable per model** (no extra “SE line”), and display only `beta_std` with stars.

---

### 4) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation mismatch)

Even when coefficient directions roughly align, the **stars often don’t match** because your p-values come from your re-estimated model (different N/specification/SEs).

Examples:
- **Education, Model 3**: generated `*` but true is `**`.
- **Female, Model 2**: generated `**` but true is `*`.
- **Southern, Model 2**: generated `*` but true is `**`.

**Fix**
- Stars will only align after you replicate:
  1) the exact sample, 2) the exact model specification, and 3) the same inference approach (likely conventional OLS SEs; but could be robust/clustered).  
- Also ensure you’re using **two-tailed tests** and the same alpha cutoffs (the true table uses * / ** / *** for .05/.01/.001).

---

### 5) Fit-stat mismatches (R², adjusted R², N, constants)

These are not minor formatting issues; they confirm the generated models are not the published ones.

**Model 1**
- Generated: N=758, R²=0.109, Adj=0.105, Constant=11.086  
- True: N=787, R²=0.107, Adj=0.104, Constant=10.920

**Model 3**
- Generated: N=508, R²=0.152, Adj=0.131, Constant=6.507  
- True: N=503, R²=0.169, Adj=0.148, Constant=6.516

**Fix**
- Reproduce the article’s sample construction and missingness rules; then recompute.
- Check whether the article uses **listwise deletion per model** or a fixed “analysis sample” across models. Your N pattern suggests you are doing per-model listwise deletion; the paper’s N pattern (787 → 756 → 503) suggests additional constraints are being applied inconsistently with yours (especially Model 1 and Model 3).

---

### 6) Output-format discrepancy: the generated “table1_style” is mis-specified

**Mismatch**
- The generated table has unlabeled rows and uses `NaN` placeholders; it is impossible to verify which coefficient belongs to which variable from that table alone.
- The “second line” beneath coefficients is not an SE row; it’s just the next coefficient printed without labels.

**Fix**
- Print a properly labeled regression table:
  - One row per predictor (in Table 1 order)
  - Columns are models
  - Cells contain standardized coefficient + stars
  - No SE rows (to match Table 1)
  - Add rows for Constant, R², Adj R², N

---

## Bottom line: what you must change so “generated” matches “true”
1. **Do not print standard errors** for the Table 1 replication.
2. **Use the same analysis sample sizes** (787 / 756 / 503). This requires matching:
   - inclusion criteria,
   - missing-data coding,
   - construction of political intolerance scale (and its inclusion rule),
   - and any filtering (e.g., year/wave/age restrictions).
3. **Match variable coding and reference categories** (especially race/ethnicity and prestige; sign flips indicate coding/spec issues).
4. **Match the standardization method** used in the paper for coefficients.
5. **Fix the table formatter** to label variables and prevent row misalignment/NaNs.

If you share the code (or at least the exact recodes for DV, income_pc, prestige, race dummies, and political intolerance scale + inclusion rule), I can point to the specific step(s) producing the N differences and the sign flips.
