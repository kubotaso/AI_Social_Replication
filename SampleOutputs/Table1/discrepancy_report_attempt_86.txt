### 1) Table structure / printed content mismatch (SEs should not be shown)
**Mismatch**
- Your **Generated Results table prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like standard errors**, but the **True Results explicitly state the PDF table reports standardized coefficients only and does not print SEs**.

**How to fix**
- Remove SE rows from the regression table output entirely (or replace them with blanks/“not reported”).
- If you want SEs anyway, you must compute them from the microdata and then clearly label the table as “standardized betas with (robust) SEs computed from data,” not “as printed.”

---

### 2) Sample size/listwise deletion is wrong in all models (biggest discrepancy)
**Mismatch (N)**
- True N: **Model 1 = 787**, **Model 2 = 756**, **Model 3 = 503**
- Generated N: **Model 1 = 748**, **Model 2 = 503**, **Model 3 = 283**

This is not a rounding issue—your estimation samples are far smaller, especially Models 2 and 3.

**Likely causes (from your own missingness tables)**
- You have extreme missingness on **hispanic (298 missing)** and **political_intolerance (402 missing)**, which drives N down to 503 and 283 via listwise deletion.
- But the printed table’s N indicates the author had **far fewer missings** (or used different coding/filters/imputation) for those same variables.

**How to fix**
To reproduce the printed Ns, you need to replicate the article’s **exact analytic sample construction** and **missing-data handling**:

1. **Apply the same survey year / subsample filter** used in the PDF table (your diagnostics show `N_year_1993 = 1606` and `N_complete_music_18 = 893`, implying you already filtered, but not in the same way as the paper).
2. **Recreate each variable exactly as in the paper** (especially `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`). Your versions appear to have many more system-missings than the paper’s.
3. Check whether the paper:
   - uses **different “valid” codes** (e.g., treating “don’t know” as valid 0 vs missing),
   - uses **multiple imputation** or other missing-data strategy,
   - or uses a **different source variable** (e.g., interviewer-coded ethnicity vs self-report).
4. Confirm that Model 3 **should have N=503** (same as your Model 2 N is currently). That strongly suggests the paper’s `political_intolerance` is *not* missing for most of the Model 2 sample, whereas yours is missing for ~45% of music-complete cases.

Until N matches, you should not expect coefficients/R² to match.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (by model/variable)

Below I list every coefficient mismatch between Generated vs True (standardized betas). I’m comparing to the “as printed” coefficients.

#### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.310*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| income_pc | -0.038 | -0.037 | essentially matches (tiny rounding diff) |
| prestg80 | 0.025 | 0.016 | too large |
| Constant | 10.848 | 10.920 | off |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.097 / 0.094 | 0.107 / 0.104 | too low |
| N | 748 | 787 | wrong sample |

**Fix**
- Once the analytic sample and variable coding match the paper, educ/prestige/R²/constant should move toward printed values. Right now they reflect a different sample.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.289*** | **-0.246*** | too negative |
| income_pc | -0.050 | -0.054 | close |
| prestg80 | -0.004 | -0.006 | close |
| female | -0.080 (no *) | **-0.083*** | sign ok; **significance wrong** |
| age | **0.095*** | **0.140*** | too small |
| black | 0.099 | 0.029 | far too large |
| hispanic | -0.074 | -0.029 | far too negative |
| other_race | -0.016 | 0.005 | wrong sign |
| conservative_protestant | 0.089 | 0.059 | too large; sig marking differs (none in true) |
| no_religion | -0.013 | -0.012 | matches |
| southern | 0.066 | **0.097** | too small and missing ** significance |
| Constant | 9.868 | 8.507 | off a lot |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.150 / 0.130 | 0.151 / 0.139 | Adj R² too low |
| N | 503 | 756 | **major** mismatch |

**Fix**
- The massive N mismatch alone can explain large differences (race coefficients and age especially).
- Also verify **reference categories / dummy coding**:
  - Your table implies race dummies include `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` (reference presumably “white”). That matches typical practice, but your *signs/magnitudes* suggest your race coding may not match the paper (e.g., “other_race” could include Hispanics in the paper, or “black” defined differently).
- Ensure you are using the same standardization method as the paper (see section 5).

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.160* | **-0.151** ** | significance level differs |
| income_pc | -0.054 | -0.009 | much too negative |
| prestg80 | -0.011 | -0.022 | somewhat off |
| female | **-0.124*** | **-0.095*** | too negative |
| age | 0.082 | **0.110*** | too small; missing * |
| black | 0.061 | 0.049 | close |
| hispanic | 0.030 | 0.031 | matches |
| other_race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| conservative_protestant | 0.037 | 0.066 | too small |
| no_religion | 0.024 | 0.024 | matches |
| southern | 0.069 | **0.121** ** | too small; missing ** |
| political_intolerance | **0.183** ** | **0.164*** | too large and wrong sig |
| Constant | 7.689 | 6.516 | off |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.146 / 0.108 | 0.169 / 0.148 | too low |
| N | 283 | 503 | **major** mismatch |

**Fix**
- Again, N is the core problem: you’re estimating Model 3 on **283** instead of **503**.
- Your `political_intolerance` variable appears to be causing huge listwise loss (402 missing among music-complete). You must:
  - rebuild `political_intolerance` exactly as the author did, and/or
  - apply the same missing-data rule (e.g., mean scale score computed if ≥k items answered; you may be requiring complete items when the author allowed partial completion).

### 4) Significance stars / p-value interpretation mismatches
Because coefficients and N differ, p-values/stars differ—but there are also “star logic” issues relative to the printed table.

Concrete mismatches:
- **Model 2 female**: Generated p≈0.060 → no star; True table shows **\***.
- **Model 3 educ**: Generated *; True shows **.
- **Model 3 political_intolerance**: Generated **; True shows ***.
- **Model 2 southern**: Generated none; True shows **.
- **Model 3 southern**: Generated none; True shows **.
- **Model 2 age**: Generated *; True shows ***.

**How to fix**
1. First fix **N and coding**; that will change standard errors and p-values.
2. Ensure you’re using the **same test** as the paper (two-tailed t-tests for OLS).
3. Ensure you’re using the same **standard error type** (classic OLS vs robust). Robust SEs would change stars.

---

### 5) Standardization method likely differs (beta_std vs “standardized coefficients as printed”)
**Mismatch**
- You compute `beta_std`, but the paper’s “standardized coefficients” could mean:
  1) variables standardized (z-scored) then OLS, **or**
  2) unstandardized OLS then post-hoc β = b * (SDx/SDy).

These are equivalent in simple OLS with an intercept if done consistently, but can differ if:
- you used a different SD definition (sample vs population, weighted vs unweighted),
- you standardized using the *model sample* vs the *full filtered sample*,
- you used weights (paper may have weights; your output appears unweighted).

**How to fix**
- Verify the paper’s approach (methods section). Then:
  - standardize using the **same estimation sample per model**,
  - use the same weighting (if any),
  - use sample SD (ddof=1) if the paper did.

---

### 6) Variable name mismatches / labeling mismatches
**Mismatch**
- Generated variable names are machine-style (`educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`) while True table uses human labels (“Education”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”). That’s not inherently wrong, but you were asked to match variable names.

**How to fix**
- Map names to printed labels in the final table output:
  - `educ` → Education
  - `income_pc` → Household income per capita
  - `prestg80` → Occupational prestige
  - `conservative_protestant` → Conservative Protestant
  - `no_religion` → No religion
  - etc.

Also confirm conceptual equivalence:
- `prestg80` must correspond to the exact prestige scale used in the paper.
- `income_pc` must be per-capita household income coded the same way (inflation-adjusted? top-coded? log-transformed? equivalized?).

---

### 7) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj R², constants)
All three models show:
- **Lower R²/Adj R²** than the true table (especially Model 3 Adj R²: 0.108 vs 0.148).
- **Different constants** (intercepts).

**How to fix**
- These will largely resolve when:
  1) analytic sample matches (N),
  2) variables are coded identically,
  3) standardization/weights match.
- Constants are particularly sensitive to whether the DV is standardized (it shouldn’t be if the constant is ~10, ~8.5, ~6.5 like the paper). So keep DV in original units and standardize X’s only (if that’s what paper did).

## Priority checklist to make “Generated” match “True”
1. **Match the analytic sample** (filters + missing-data rules) so N becomes **787 / 756 / 503**.
2. **Reconstruct `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`** to eliminate the excessive missingness you currently have.
3. **Confirm dummy codings and reference categories** for race, religion, region.
4. **Replicate the paper’s standardization + weighting** approach.
5. **Remove SE lines** from the table if you are claiming to reproduce the printed table.

If you share the code you used to build `hispanic` and especially `political_intolerance` (and any filtering steps), I can point to the exact step that is creating the N collapse and coefficient divergences.
