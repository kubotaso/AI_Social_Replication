============================================================

Below is an item-by-item audit of where the **Generated Results** fail to match the **True Results** (Table 1), covering **variable naming, coefficients (standardized β), constants, R²/Adj. R², N, stars, and interpretation**—and what you must change to make the generated analysis align.

---

## 1) Fundamental mismatch: you compared the wrong estimands (and mixed metrics)

### What Table 1 (“True Results”) reports
- **Standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors
- **Unstandardized constant**
- **No standard errors shown**
- Stars are based on the paper’s reported significance, not your model’s p-values

### What your Generated Results contain
- Both **unstandardized b** and **standardized beta**
- Stars appear to be computed from **your p-values**
- You also present model fit (R², adj R², N) from your estimation sample—which is **not the paper’s sample**

### How to fix
To match the paper:
1. **Report only standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors (education, age, etc.).
2. **Report the constant unstandardized** (as the paper does).
3. **Do not report standard errors** (or mark them as “not reported”).
4. **Do not derive stars from your p-values** if the goal is to reproduce Table 1 exactly; instead, **use the stars as printed** in the table (or reproduce them only if you can exactly reproduce the dataset, coding, weights, and sample restrictions used by the authors).

---

## 2) Sample size (N) mismatches across all three models (major)

### N in True Results
- Model 1: **787**
- Model 2: **756**
- Model 3: **503**

### N in Generated Results
- Model 1: **747**
- Model 2: **507**
- Model 3: **286**

### Why this happens
Your **missingness + complete-case approach** is dropping far more cases than the paper:
- `pol_intol` missing ~47%
- outcome missing ~44%
- `hispanic` missing ~35%
…and you are using complete-case per model (as shown in `complete_case_audit`).

### How to fix
To match the paper’s N, you need to replicate *their* inclusion rules and coding, not just listwise deletion on your constructed variables.

Concrete fixes:
- **Verify you are using the same GSS year (1993) and same subsample** as the paper (e.g., sometimes only respondents asked the music battery, or only those with valid responses).
- **Recode “inapplicable / don’t know / no answer / not asked” correctly**. In GSS-style data, large “missingness” often reflects “not in universe” that must be handled consistently with the authors’ procedure.
- Confirm that your constructed variables are correct:
  - `num_genres_disliked` likely must be computed from a **specific set of genre items** and possibly only among those who received all/most items.
  - `pol_intol` often comes from a battery; you must ensure the scale is computed exactly as the authors did (items included, direction, minimum valid items, etc.).
- If you cannot reproduce the exact case counts with correct recodes, do **not claim replication**; instead label your results as “re-estimation on available cases.”

## 3) Fit statistics mismatch (R² and adjusted R²)

### True vs Generated
**Model 1**
- True R² **0.107**, Adj R² **0.104**
- Generated R² **0.088**, Adj R² **0.085**

**Model 2**
- True R² **0.151**, Adj R² **0.139**
- Generated R² **0.139**, Adj R² **0.120**

**Model 3**
- True R² **0.169**, Adj R² **0.148**
- Generated R² **0.149**, Adj R² **0.111**

### Cause
Primarily:
- Different **N / sample composition**
- Potentially different **coding** (especially the dependent variable and political intolerance scale)
- Possibly different **weighting** (GSS analyses often use weights; the paper may or may not)
- Possibly different **treatment of missing data**

### How to fix
- First fix the **sample and coding** to match the paper’s N.
- Check whether the authors used **weights** and apply the same weight variable if so.
- Ensure the dependent variable construction exactly matches Table 1’s “Number of Music Genres Disliked.”

---

## 4) Variable naming mismatches (minor but still mismatches)

Table 1 uses short names; your output uses expanded labels. That’s not inherently wrong, but you also need to ensure **conceptual equivalence**.

### Examples
- True: “Education” vs Generated: “Education (years)”  
  - This is only OK if the paper indeed used years of education; many papers do, but confirm.
- True: “Household income per capita” vs Generated: same label, but your raw variable is `inc_pc` and your unstandardized coefficient is ~ -0.000012, implying income is in **very large units**. That’s fine for β, but it signals you must verify scaling.
- True: “Political intolerance” vs Generated: “Political intolerance (0–15)”
  - You must confirm the same range and construction.

### How to fix
- Keep your descriptive labels, but **add a codebook mapping** proving each matches the paper’s definition (items, coding, range, handling of missing).

---

## 5) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model (this is the core replication failure)

Below I compare **standardized β** (because that’s what Table 1 reports). I’m using your `table1_combined` values (which appear to be β), and cross-checking against `model*_full beta` where needed.

### Model 1 (SES): β mismatches
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | **-0.292*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.037 | **-0.039** | close (minor) |
| Occ prestige | 0.016 | **0.020** | slightly higher |
| Constant | 10.920 | **10.638** | mismatch |
| R² | 0.107 | **0.088** | mismatch |
| N | 787 | **747** | mismatch |

**Fix**: sample/coding/weights; once N matches, coefficients usually move toward target.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic): several β and sign mismatches
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | **-0.265*** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.054 | **-0.051** | close |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | **-0.011** | more negative |
| Female | -0.083* | **-0.085*** | β close, but see stars |
| Age | 0.140*** | **0.103*** | too small; star level wrong |
| Black | 0.029 | **0.100** | way too large |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **0.074** | wrong sign |
| Other race | 0.005 | **-0.027** | wrong sign |
| Cons Prot | 0.059 | **0.087** | too large |
| No religion | -0.012 | **-0.015** | close |
| Southern | 0.097** | **0.061** | too small; star mismatch |
| Constant | 8.507 | **8.675** | mismatch |
| R² | 0.151 | **0.139** | mismatch |
| N | 756 | **507** | mismatch |

**Fix**: the especially large discrepancies (Hispanic sign flip, Other race sign flip, Black inflated) strongly suggest **coding differences**:
- Your “Hispanic” may be coded differently (e.g., 1=non-Hispanic, or mis-specified reference).
- “Other race” may not match the paper’s construction (paper likely uses mutually exclusive race categories with White as reference).
- Ensure race/ethnicity categories are created exactly as in the paper, and that “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other” are dummy variables with **White omitted**.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): mismatches + multiple sign changes
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | **-0.155*** | close magnitude; star mismatch |
| Income pc | -0.009 | **-0.052** | far too negative |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | **-0.015** | somewhat close |
| Female | -0.095* | **-0.127*** | too negative |
| Age | 0.110* | **0.091** | too small; star mismatch |
| Black | 0.049 | **0.060** | close |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | **-0.030** | wrong sign |
| Other race | 0.053 | **0.053** | matches (nice) |
| Cons Prot | 0.066 | **0.036** | too small |
| No religion | 0.024 | **0.023** | matches |
| Southern | 0.121** | **0.068** | too small; star mismatch |
| Pol intolerance | 0.164*** | **0.184**** | too large; star mismatch |
| Constant | 6.516 | **7.999** | large mismatch |
| R² | 0.169 | **0.149** | mismatch |
| N | 503 | **286** | mismatch |

**Fix**:
- Again, N mismatch is huge; fix sample and coding first.
- The income β being wildly off indicates either:
  - income per capita is coded differently (transform/log used in paper?), or
  - you restricted to a very different subsample in Model 3 (complete cases on `pol_intol`) causing selection effects.
- The constant mismatch (7.999 vs 6.516) strongly signals a different scale/centering of predictors or a different sample.

---

## 6) Standard errors: “mismatches” that shouldn’t exist (because True Results don’t report SE)

You were asked to identify mismatches in SEs—but the **True Results explicitly say SEs are not reported**.

### Problem in your generated comparison
- You cannot claim SE discrepancies relative to the paper because the paper table does not provide them.

### Fix
- Remove SE comparisons entirely or mark SE as **“not available in Table 1”**.
- If you want to compare significance, compare **stars only**, but only after matching coding/sample/weights.

---

## 7) Significance stars and interpretation mismatches

### Stars mismatch examples
- Model 2 Age: True **0.140*** but Generated shows Age with only `*` in the full model p=0.019 and in table as `0.103*`
- Model 3 Political intolerance: True **0.164*** but Generated shows `0.184**`

### Why
Your stars are computed from your own p-values, based on a different sample (and maybe different model assumptions). This is not “wrong,” but it does not match the printed table.

### Fix
Decide which goal you have:
- **Replication of the printed table**: use the table’s coefficients and stars verbatim (don’t recompute p-values).
- **Re-estimation**: keep your p-values but **do not claim agreement with Table 1**; instead report differences and explain likely sources (sample, coding, weights).

---

## 8) Interpretation mismatch: outcome and model labels vs paper

You label Model 3 as “Political intolerance (0–15)” and treat it as added predictor (correct structurally), but because your **N collapses to 286**, your Model 3 is effectively a different population. Any interpretation like “political intolerance increases genres disliked” is not comparable to the paper’s effect unless the same sample is used.

### Fix
- After aligning sample to **N=503** for Model 3, re-check β and stars.
- If you must use your data as-is, explicitly interpret as “among complete cases with valid pol_intol and outcome,” not as a replication.

# Summary of what to change to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Recreate the exact analysis sample** used by the paper (1993 GSS; correct universe; correct missing codes; likely weights).
2. **Reconstruct the dependent variable** (“number of music genres disliked”) exactly as the authors did (which items; how “dislike” is coded; how many items required).
3. **Reconstruct political intolerance** exactly (items, direction, scale range, missing handling).
4. **Construct race/ethnicity dummies correctly** (mutually exclusive; White reference), to fix sign flips for Hispanic/Other race.
5. **Report standardized β only** (predictors), **unstandardized constant**, and **omit SEs** (since the paper omits them).
6. **Do not compute stars from your own p-values** if the goal is to mirror the published table; otherwise, label results as re-estimated and expect star differences.

If you share the code (or at least the variable construction steps for `num_genres_disliked`, `pol_intol`, and race/ethnicity) and whether you used weights, I can pinpoint exactly which recode is causing the Hispanic and “Other race” sign reversals and the massive N drop.
