Score: 28/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable name / labeling mismatches (table output vs “true” Table 1)

**Mismatch:** Generated table uses internal/short names in places and does not consistently match Table 1 labels.  
- `educ` should be labeled **Education**  
- `income_pc` should be labeled **Household income per capita**  
- `prestg80` should be labeled **Occupational prestige**  
- `conservative_protestant` should be labeled **Conservative Protestant**  
- `no_religion` should be labeled **No religion**  
- `southern` should be labeled **Southern**  
- `political_intolerance` should be labeled **Political intolerance**  
- DV label matches (Number of music genres disliked) — OK.

**How to fix:** In the table-building code, add a variable-label dictionary and force printed names to match Table 1 exactly (including capitalization). If you’re using a package (e.g., stargazer/modelsummary), use its “coef_map” / “covariate.labels” option.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **every coefficient mismatch** between Generated vs True (Table 1). Differences are “Generated − True”.

#### SES Model
- **Education:** Generated **-0.310*** vs True **-0.322*** → mismatch (+0.012)
- **Household income per capita:** **-0.038** vs **-0.037** → mismatch (-0.001; tiny)
- **Occupational prestige:** **0.025** vs **0.016** → mismatch (+0.009)

#### Demographic Model
- **Education:** **-0.247*** vs **-0.246*** → mismatch (-0.001; tiny)
- **Household income per capita:** **-0.052** vs **-0.054** → mismatch (+0.002)
- **Occupational prestige:** **0.009** vs **-0.006** → mismatch (+0.015; sign differs)
- **Female:** **-0.079*** (generated shows -0.079* in table; long has p=.0245) vs **-0.083*** → mismatch (+0.004)
- **Age:** **0.114** vs **0.140*** → mismatch (-0.026) and **significance differs** (** vs ***)

- **No religion:** **-0.000** vs **-0.012** → mismatch (+0.012)
- **Southern:** **0.065** vs **0.097**** → mismatch (-0.032) and **significance differs** (none vs **)

#### Political Intolerance Model
- **Education:** **-0.146*** (generated has * only) vs **-0.151**** → mismatch (+0.005) and **significance differs** (* vs **)
- **Household income per capita:** **-0.018** vs **-0.009** → mismatch (-0.009)
- **Occupational prestige:** **-0.007** vs **-0.022** → mismatch (+0.015)
- **Female:** **-0.097*** vs **-0.095*** → mismatch (-0.002; tiny)
- **Age:** **0.045** vs **0.110*** → mismatch (-0.065) and **significance differs** (none vs *)
- **Black:** **-0.004** vs **0.049** → mismatch (-0.053; sign differs)
- **Hispanic:** **0.082** vs **0.031** → mismatch (+0.051)
- **Other race:** **0.049** vs **0.053** → mismatch (-0.004)
- **Conservative Protestant:** **0.084** vs **0.066** → mismatch (+0.018)
- **No religion:** **0.025** vs **0.024** → mismatch (+0.001; tiny)
- **Southern:** **0.068** vs **0.121**** → mismatch (-0.053) and **significance differs** (none vs **)
- **Political intolerance:** **0.181*** vs **0.164*** → mismatch (+0.017)

**How to fix (most likely causes):**
1. **Standardization method mismatch.**  
   Table 1 reports “standardized OLS coefficients.” Your `beta_std` may be computed differently (e.g., post-hoc standardization using model matrix SDs, or using different SD definitions, or standardizing only X not Y).  
   **Fix:** Replicate exactly the paper’s standardization:
   - Standardize **all continuous predictors and the DV** using the same rule the authors used (typically z-scores with sample SD) *before* OLS, then coefficients equal standardized betas.
   - Confirm whether binary indicators were left unstandardized (0/1) or standardized as well. Many tables standardize everything; others standardize only continuous variables. Your results suggest you may be mixing approaches.
2. **Sample mismatch / listwise deletion not matching the paper.**  
   Your N is smaller in all models (see Section 4). Different N → different coefficients.
   **Fix:** Reproduce the authors’ exact inclusion rules and missing-data handling (see below).
3. **Different coding of race/region/religion indicators.**  
   Sign flips for **Hispanic** (Demographic model) and **Black** (Political intolerance model) strongly suggest your dummy coding / reference group differs from the paper’s.
   **Fix:** Match the paper’s coding:
   - Ensure **mutually exclusive race dummies** with the same omitted category as Table 1 (often “White” as reference).  
   - Verify that “Other race” excludes Black/Hispanic, etc.
   - Verify Southern, Conservative Protestant, No religion are defined identically to the paper.
4. **Different construction of the political intolerance scale.**  
   Your diagnostics show political intolerance items answered range 0–15 and mean ~9.77, but Table 1’s coefficient depends on *their* scale construction and missingness rules.
   **Fix:** Rebuild the political intolerance measure exactly as described in the paper/PDF methods (item list, coding, summation vs mean, treatment of DK/refused, minimum answered items, etc.).

### 3) Standard errors: generated output includes them, but True Table 1 does not

**Mismatch:** Generated “table1_style” prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like an SE row, but the True Results explicitly say **Table 1 does not print SEs**.

**How to fix:**  
- Remove SEs from the presentation for Table 1 to match the PDF (“standardized coefficients only”).  
- If you want SEs for your own appendix, label it as such, but don’t claim it matches Table 1.

### 4) Model fit statistics and constants: all mismatch

#### N (cases)
- SES: Generated **748** vs True **787** → mismatch (-39)
- Demographic: **740** vs **756** → mismatch (-16)
- Political intolerance: **418** vs **503** → mismatch (-85)

#### R² / Adjusted R²
- SES: R² **0.097** vs **0.107**; Adj **0.094** vs **0.104**
- Demographic: R² **0.128** vs **0.151**; Adj **0.115** vs **0.139**
- Political intolerance: R² **0.133** vs **0.169**; Adj **0.107** vs **0.148**

#### Constants
- SES: **10.848** vs **10.920**
- Demographic: **8.683** vs **8.507** (note direction flip)
- Political intolerance: **7.131** vs **6.516**

**How to fix:** These are classic symptoms of **not using the same analytic sample and/or not using the same variable constructions** as the paper.
- **Primary fix:** Match the paper’s sample definition for “year 1993” and for “music module complete,” and match their missing data rules.
- **Political intolerance model:** your missingness table shows **402 missing** on `political_intolerance`, leaving 491 nonmissing among music-complete cases, yet your model N is **418**, meaning you’re additionally losing 73 cases to other covariates’ missingness. The paper ends with **503**, which implies either:
  - they had fewer missings on the intolerance measure (constructed differently), and/or
  - they used a less strict rule than listwise deletion (e.g., allowed partial scales or did imputation).

### 5) Significance stars / interpretation mismatches

Because coefficients (and possibly SE/p-values) differ, several **star annotations do not match** Table 1:

- **Demographic model Age:** Generated ** (p=.0018) but Table 1 has ***.
- **Demographic model Conservative Protestant:** Generated * but Table 1 shows no star.
- **Demographic model Southern:** Generated no star (p≈.07) but Table 1 has **.
- **Political model Education:** Generated * but Table 1 has **.
- **Political model Age:** Generated none but Table 1 has *.
- **Political model Southern:** Generated none but Table 1 has **.

**How to fix:**
- First fix the **coefficients/sample/coding** issues above; stars will largely follow.
- Ensure you’re using the same **two-tailed thresholds** (*p*<.05/.01/.001) and the same test (usual OLS t-test).
- If you compute **robust SEs** but the paper uses classical OLS SEs (or vice versa), stars will differ. Match the paper’s SE choice.

### 6) The biggest “root causes” to address (priority order)

1. **Reproduce the paper’s analytic Ns (787 / 756 / 503).**  
   Until N matches, coefficients/R² won’t match. Audit every filter and missing-data rule.
2. **Match variable coding/reference categories** for race, religion, region, and sex.
3. **Match the political intolerance scale construction** (this is likely why your Model 3 N is far smaller and the black/age/southern effects shift).
4. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way the authors did** (standardize DV and predictors pre-estimation, or replicate their exact beta computation).

If you share the paper’s methods text (or codebook snippets) for how race/religion and political intolerance were constructed and what missing-value codes were recoded, I can tell you exactly which recodes and reference categories will reconcile the remaining sign/size differences.
