============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics (R², adj. R², N) — all mismatched

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N:** generated **747** vs true **787** (−40 cases)
- **R²:** generated **0.088** vs true **0.107**
- **Adj R²:** generated **0.0846** vs true **0.104**
- **Implication:** your estimation sample and/or variable construction differs from the paper’s.

**Fix**
- Recreate the paper’s **exact sample restrictions** for GSS 1993 and the dependent variable (“number of music genres disliked”).
- Ensure you’re using the **same missing-data handling** as the paper (very likely listwise deletion within each model, but your N’s suggest additional exclusions).
- Verify you are not accidentally subsetting to cases with nonmissing variables that are *not in Model 1* (e.g., political intolerance), which would shrink N incorrectly.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N:** generated **745** vs true **756** (−11)
- **R²:** generated **0.1246** vs true **0.151**
- **Adj R²:** generated **0.1114** vs true **0.139**
- **Fix:** same as above; additionally confirm coding of race/region/religion dummies matches the paper.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N:** generated **421** vs true **503** (−82)
- **R²:** generated **0.1316** vs true **0.169**
- **Adj R²:** generated **0.1082** vs true **0.148**
- Generated output also says **“dropped hispanic”** and shows **Hispanic = NaN** (see §2).

**Fix**
- You’re losing far too many cases in Model 3. Your missingness table shows **political intolerance is ~47% missing**, which is consistent with a big drop, but the *paper’s* N=503 implies either:
  1) they used a **different political intolerance measure** with less missingness, and/or  
  2) they used a **different base sample** (e.g., only those asked the intolerance battery), and then modeled within that, and/or  
  3) your merge/recode produced extra missing values.
- Reconstruct *exactly* the paper’s political intolerance index and confirm its valid range and item availability in 1993.

## 2) Variable names & inclusion — mostly OK, one major structural error

### Hispanic dropped in Model 3 (major mismatch)
- **True Model 3:** Hispanic is included with **β = +0.031 (ns)**.
- **Generated Model 3:** Hispanic is **dropped** (NaN).

**What this indicates**
- Perfect collinearity/aliasing in your Model 3 design matrix (e.g., you included *all* race dummies plus an intercept, or Hispanic became constant within the Model 3 subset).
- Or Hispanic got converted to all missing / single-valued in the reduced Model 3 frame.

**Fix**
- Ensure race is coded with a proper reference category:
  - Use (for example) White as reference, and include **Black, Hispanic, Other** only (NOT White dummy).
- Check within the Model 3 estimation sample (nonmissing on all Model 3 vars):
  - `table(hispanic)` and `var(hispanic)`; if all 0/1 only one value appears, you’ve inadvertently restricted the sample.
- If using factor coding, do **not** manually create all dummy columns plus also treat race as a factor (double-encoding).

## 3) Coefficients (standardized β) — many mismatches

Important: the paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**, while your “table1style” output is also β-like. Comparison should be done against your **beta** column / table1style values, not the raw unstandardized **b**.

### Model 1 β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.292 | **-0.322** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | close (minor) |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | close (minor) |
| Constant | 10.638 | **10.920** | differs |

**Fix**
- Constant difference + β difference + R² difference strongly suggests **different sample or different coding** (especially DV scaling or education measure).
- Verify DV construction (“num_genres_disliked”) exactly matches paper: same set of genres, same missing handling, same counting rule.
- Verify education is in **years** and not recoded/trimmed differently.

### Model 2 β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.229 | **-0.246** | too small magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.055 | -0.054 | close |
| Prestige | +0.002 | **-0.006** | sign mismatch |
| Female | -0.086* | -0.083* | close |
| Age | 0.125*** | **0.140*** | too small |
| Black | 0.022 | 0.029 | small |
| Hispanic | -0.026 | -0.029 | small |
| Other race | **-0.010** | **+0.005** | sign mismatch |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.092* | 0.059 | magnitude mismatch; also your sig differs (true shows no star) |
| No religion | -0.002 | -0.012 | magnitude mismatch |
| Southern | 0.062 | **0.097\*\*** | magnitude + significance mismatch |
| Constant | 8.490 | 8.507 | close |

**Fix**
- The sign flips (prestige, other race) and big shifts (southern, cons prot) are not rounding noise; they usually come from:
  1) **different dummy definitions/reference categories** (e.g., “Other race” defined differently; “Southern” coded differently), and/or  
  2) **different weighting** (paper may use GSS weights; your regression appears unweighted), and/or  
  3) **different sample** (your N is smaller).
- Check:
  - South: confirm it’s Census South and coded 1/0 consistent with paper.
  - Religion: confirm “Conservative Protestant” classification matches the paper’s scheme (often nontrivial).
  - Race: confirm mutually exclusive categories and the same reference group.

### Model 3 β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.145* | **-0.151\*\*** | sig level mismatch |
| Income pc | -0.015 | -0.009 | magnitude mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.010 | -0.022 | magnitude mismatch |
| Female | -0.100* | -0.095* | close |
| Age | 0.057 (ns) | **0.110\*** | major mismatch |
| Black | 0.056 | 0.049 | close-ish |
| Hispanic | (dropped) | **+0.031** | major structural error |
| Other race | 0.049 | 0.053 | close |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.084 | 0.066 | some mismatch |
| No religion | 0.026 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.064 | **0.121\*\*** | major mismatch |
| Political intolerance | **0.178*** | **0.164*** | somewhat high |
| Constant | **7.077** | **6.516** | notable mismatch |

**Fix**
- The biggest substantive problems are **Age**, **Southern**, and the **dropped Hispanic** plus the large N gap.
- These point to a **different estimation subsample** for Model 3 (likely not matching the paper’s), and/or incorrect political intolerance variable construction that induces selection and changes covariate distributions.
- Rebuild Model 3 sample to hit **N≈503** first; coefficients will not match until N and coding match.

## 4) Standard errors — reported when the true table does not report them
- **True results:** SEs are **not reported** in Table 1.
- **Generated results:** you report p-values/significance based on SEs.

This is not “wrong” statistically, but it **does not match the reported table**.

**Fix**
- If your goal is to replicate Table 1 formatting, suppress SEs/p-values and display only:
  - standardized β for predictors
  - unstandardized constant
  - stars using the paper’s thresholds
- Alternatively, keep SEs but clearly label them as **your computed SEs**, not extracted from the table.

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Because many β differ, your stars differ too. Concrete mismatches:

- **Model 2 Southern:** generated no star; true is **0.097\*\***.
- **Model 2 Conservative Protestant:** generated *; true shows **no star** (β=0.059, apparently ns in paper).
- **Model 3 Education:** generated *; true is **\*\***.
- **Model 3 Age:** generated ns; true is *.
- **Model 3 Southern:** generated ns; true is **\*\***.

**Fix**
- Once the **sample**, **weights**, and **coding** match, the p-values/stars should align more closely.
- Also confirm you’re using the same inference approach:
  - OLS with conventional SEs vs robust SEs vs design-based (GSS weights/strata/PSU). Different SE methods change stars without changing β much.

---

## 6) Core methodological discrepancies likely causing most mismatches (and how to correct)

1) **Wrong/extra subsetting across models**
   - Your N’s suggest you might be restricting earlier models to cases with nonmissing variables from later models (especially political intolerance).
   - **Fix:** Build each model’s analytic dataset separately using only vars in that model.

2) **Weights/design effects**
   - Many GSS replications require weights; the paper may use them.
   - **Fix:** Determine whether Table 1 uses `WTSSALL`/`WTSSNR` etc. If yes, run weighted OLS and (if appropriate) design-correct SEs.

3) **Dummy coding/reference categories**
   - Hispanic being dropped is a red flag for dummy construction.
   - **Fix:** Use factor variables with a defined reference (or drop one dummy manually), and verify no redundant columns.

4) **Political intolerance index construction**
   - Your missing rate and N=421 vs 503 suggests a different index or stricter missing rule.
   - **Fix:** Match the paper’s index: same items, same scaling (0–15), same rule for partial completion (e.g., mean of answered items vs listwise across items).

5) **Dependent variable construction**
   - Constant and R² differences often arise from DV differences.
   - **Fix:** Confirm the exact genre items included and how “disliked” is counted; ensure “don’t know/NA” handled as paper did.

---

## Checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1
1) Recreate DV exactly; verify its distribution vs paper if available.
2) Recreate each IV coding exactly (esp. conservative Protestant; South; race categories).
3) Build model-specific complete-case samples; confirm N hits **787 / 756 / 503**.
4) Ensure standardized coefficients computed the same way as the paper (standardize X and Y before OLS, or compute β from b using SD ratios).
5) Apply the same weighting/design (if used).
6) Re-run; then format output to show only standardized β (and unstandardized constant), no SEs, with stars.

If you share your code (or at least how each variable is constructed and what weights you use), I can pinpoint which of the above is the actual source of each mismatch rather than the plausible set.
