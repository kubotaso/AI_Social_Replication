Score: 41/100
============================================================

Below is a term-by-term comparison of your **Generated Results** versus the **True (Table 1) results**, flagging *every* mismatch in (a) variable names/coding, (b) coefficients (standardized β and constants), (c) model fit stats (N, R², adj. R²), and (d) interpretation/significance. I also explain how to fix each issue so the generated analysis reproduces Table 1.

---

## 1) What the “true” table reports vs what you generated (root cause)

### True Table 1
- Reports **standardized OLS coefficients (β)** for predictors.
- Reports **unstandardized constants**.
- **Does not report standard errors**.
- Stars reflect significance of the underlying OLS model (two-tailed).

### Generated output
- You produced **both unstandardized b and standardized beta** (fine), **but your “Table1-style” output uses the standardized beta**, which is the right target.
- However, your **standardized betas do not match** the table’s betas in many places, and your **constants, N, R², adj R²** also do not match.
- Your p-values/stars frequently don’t match the stars in Table 1.

This pattern strongly suggests you did **not replicate the paper’s analytic sample and/or variable construction** (especially listwise deletion rules and coding of race categories, region, and the political intolerance scale), and possibly not the same weighting/design choices.

---

## 2) Fit statistics mismatches (N, R², adjusted R²)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Generated:** n=747, R²=0.088, adj R²=0.085  
- **True:** n=787, R²=0.107, adj R²=0.104  
**Mismatch:** N is **-40**, R² and adj R² are **too low**.

**How to fix**
1. **Match the paper’s inclusion criteria for Model 1** (likely listwise deletion only on SES vars + outcome, not extra filters).
2. Ensure the dependent variable is exactly **“Number of music genres disliked”** as constructed in the paper (same items, same missing handling).
3. Check you didn’t inadvertently drop cases due to recodes of demographics that aren’t in Model 1.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Generated:** n=507, R²=0.138, adj R²=0.119  
- **True:** n=756, R²=0.151, adj R²=0.139  
**Mismatch:** N is **-249**. R²/adj R² are also off (adj R² especially much lower, consistent with too-small N or different variables).

**How to fix**
- Your Model 2 sample is collapsing because of missingness in *something you included or required* that the paper did not require for Model 2.
- The smoking gun is your **missingness table**: `hispanic` shows **35% missing**, which is atypically high for a simple Hispanic indicator and would indeed destroy N if treated as required.
  - In many GSS extracts, “Hispanic” is **derivable from race/ethnicity variables** or may require special handling; you may have used a variable with extensive NIU/INAP codes and treated them as missing instead of “not Hispanic.”

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Generated:** n=286, R²=0.148, adj R²=0.111  
- **True:** n=503, R²=0.169, adj R²=0.148  
**Mismatch:** N is **-217**, and fit is too low.

**How to fix**
- Your `pol_intol` is **47% missing** per your missingness table; if you’re listwise deleting, that alone can force N down. The paper’s Model 3 still has **503 cases**, so the paper’s political intolerance measure is not missing nearly as much *in the analytic sample*.
- Likely issues:
  1. You built `pol_intol` from items with different universe/skip patterns and treated skips as missing rather than valid.
  2. You used the wrong year/filter so many intolerance items are absent.
  3. You required `pol_intol` even for respondents who legitimately weren’t asked some items (paper may use a different scale construction or imputation rule).

## 3) Variable name / category mismatches (structural problems)

### Race categories: “Other race”
- **Generated terms:** Black, Hispanic, Other race  
- **True terms:** Black, Hispanic, Other race  
Names match, but **your “Other race” coefficient sign differs in Model 2** (see below), which often indicates **reference category/coding differences** (e.g., you made “Other race” a residual category differently than the paper).

**Fix**
- Ensure race dummies are mutually exclusive and match the paper:
  - Reference group: typically **White non-Hispanic**.
  - “Hispanic” often overrides race in some constructions (paper may code Hispanic as separate ethnicity category; you might have treated it as a standalone dummy without excluding Hispanics from “White/Black/Other”).

### “Southern”
- Same name, but your coefficient is consistently smaller and loses significance compared to true table, suggesting different region coding or sample.

**Fix**
- Verify South is defined identically (GSS region vs. South dummy from `REGION`/`SRCBELT`/`XNORCSIZ` etc.). The paper’s “Southern” is usually a Census South indicator.

### Outcome variable
- Your generated output references `num_genres_disliked` in missingness but Table 1 DV is “Number of music genres disliked”.
- If your DV construction differs (e.g., different genre list or handling “don’t know”), coefficients and constants will drift.

**Fix**
- Reconstruct DV exactly as in the paper: same genre items, same coding of “dislike,” same additive index, and same missing rule.

## 4) Coefficient mismatches (standardized β in Table 1)

Your “table1_combined” uses standardized betas, which is correct. Below are the mismatches term-by-term.

### Model 1 (SES): β and constant
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | **Mismatch** |
| HH income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | Slight mismatch |
| Occ prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | Slight mismatch |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | **Mismatch** |

Also fit stats mismatch (Section 2).

**Fix**
- Primary: fix sample (N should be 787), DV construction, and any weights.
- Secondary: confirm standardized betas computed as in the paper:
  - Standardize predictors and outcome (or compute β from unstandardized b using SDs). Different standardization conventions can create modest differences, but your Education gap (-0.292 vs -0.322) is larger than rounding error and likely sample/DV mismatch.

### Model 2 (Demographic): β and constant
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | **Mismatch** |
| HH income pc | -0.054 | -0.054 | **Match** |
| Occ prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | Mismatch |
| Female | -0.087* | -0.083* | Small mismatch |
| Age | 0.103* | 0.140*** | **Big mismatch (size + stars)** |
| Black | 0.036 | 0.029 | Small mismatch |
| Hispanic | -0.027 | -0.029 | Small mismatch |
| Other race | -0.020 | 0.005 | **Mismatch (sign differs)** |
| Cons Prot | 0.081 | 0.059 | Mismatch |
| No religion | -0.018 | -0.012 | Mismatch |
| Southern | 0.063 | 0.097** | **Mismatch (size + stars)** |
| Constant | 9.703 | 8.507 | **Mismatch** |

**Interpretation mismatches (stars):**
- **Age**: you have `*` (p≈.02) but true is `***` and larger β (0.140).
- **Southern**: you have no star; true is `**`.
- These are not just “star formatting” issues—they reflect different estimates.

**Fix**
- Fix the **demographic variable coding** (especially “Other race” and “Hispanic” construction) and especially the **analytic sample** (your N is drastically smaller).
- Once N and coding match, re-run OLS and then compute standardized betas.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): β and constant
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157* | -0.151** | Mismatch (stars differ) |
| HH income pc | -0.050 | -0.009 | **Big mismatch** |
| Occ prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | Mismatch |
| Female | -0.126* | -0.095* | Mismatch |
| Age | 0.091 | 0.110* | Mismatch (stars differ) |
| Black | 0.085 | 0.049 | Mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.007 | 0.031 | Mismatch |
| Other race | 0.051 | 0.053 | Close match |
| Cons Prot | 0.038 | 0.066 | Mismatch |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.024 | **Match** |
| Southern | 0.068 | 0.121** | **Big mismatch (size + stars)** |
| Political intolerance | 0.183** | 0.164*** | **Mismatch (size + stars)** |
| Constant | 7.619 | 6.516 | **Mismatch** |

**Fix**
- The biggest red flags here are:
  1. **Income**: -0.050 vs -0.009 (huge difference).
  2. **Southern**: 0.068 vs 0.121**.
  3. **Political intolerance**: star level and size differ.
  4. **N**: 286 vs 503.
- These point to a **different sample and/or different construction of political intolerance and income per capita** (e.g., scaling, top-coding, inflation adjustment, equivalization, or handling of missing/NIU).
- Rebuild `pol_intol` exactly as the paper defines (items included, scoring range, and treatment of “don’t know”/skips).
- Ensure income per capita matches the paper (household income divided by household size? and whether size includes adults only?).

## 5) Standard errors: you reported them indirectly via p-values; Table 1 has none

You were instructed to compare standard errors, but:
- **Generated:** p-values (implies SEs exist); also unstandardized b.
- **True:** Table 1 explicitly **does not report SEs**.

**Mismatch in presentation**
- Your output implies a precision level that Table 1 doesn’t provide. That’s not “wrong” for an analysis replication, but it **does not match** the reported table format.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match Table 1 presentation: suppress SEs/p-values and show only standardized β and stars.
- If the goal is to match the *underlying regression*: you can keep SEs, but the estimates must match first (via sample/coding).

---

## 6) Specific generated elements that are inconsistent with “matching Table 1”

### A) You mix unstandardized constants with standardized betas (this part is correct)
Table 1 does that too. No fix needed.

### B) “dropped_predictors” column
Not part of the paper’s table. Not an error, but it means your pipeline is not aimed purely at reproduction.

**Fix**
- Remove from the final reproduction table.

### C) Missingness patterns are incompatible with the paper’s Ns
Your own missingness table shows:
- `pol_intol` 47% missing
- `num_genres_disliked` 44% missing
- `hispanic` 35% missing

But the paper achieves N=787/756/503. With DV missing at 44%, you generally wouldn’t get N=787 unless the full dataset is far larger than 1993 GSS subsample used or unless your DV variable is not the same as the paper’s.

**Fix**
- Recreate the DV and key predictors from raw items; don’t rely on a partially-missing derived variable unless you know it matches the paper.
- Treat GSS missing codes correctly (e.g., DK/NA/INAP) consistent with the paper; do not blanket-convert all non-substantive codes to NA if the paper recoded some to 0 or used different universes.

---

## 7) How to make the generated analysis match (action checklist)

1. **Lock the dataset**: confirm it is **GSS 1993** and the same subsample restrictions as the paper (age limits? valid interviews only?).
2. **Rebuild the dependent variable** (“# genres disliked”) from the exact genre items used in the paper:
   - Same set of genres
   - Same rule for “dislike”
   - Same index scoring
   - Same missing handling
3. **Rebuild key predictors**:
   - `inc_pc`: match the paper’s per-capita definition (income / household size) and handle top-coding/missing codes.
   - `pol_intol`: match items, scaling (0–15), and skip/missing rules to get N close to **503** in Model 3.
   - Race/ethnicity: enforce mutually exclusive categories and correct reference group (likely White non-Hispanic).
   - South: correct regional dummy.
4. **Use the same estimation choices**:
   - OLS (as paper)
   - If the paper used weights (unclear from your excerpt), apply the same weight; if not, don’t weight.
5. **Compute standardized betas exactly like Table 1**:
   - Use the same sample as each model (listwise deletion within-model).
   - Standardize consistently (prefer: compute β from the fitted model using sample SDs of X and Y used in that model).
6. **Recreate Table 1 output**:
   - Report standardized β with stars
   - Report unstandardized constant
   - Include R², adj R², and N matching the paper.

If you share (a) your code for constructing `num_genres_disliked` and `pol_intol`, and (b) the exact GSS variable names you used for Hispanic and income/household size, I can pinpoint the precise coding step that’s causing the N collapse and the sign flip for “Other race.”
