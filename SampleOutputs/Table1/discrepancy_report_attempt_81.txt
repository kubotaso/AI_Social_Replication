## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is incorrectly dropped in Models 2 and 3**
- **Generated** (`coefficients_long`): `hispanic` has `included = False` and `beta_std = NaN` in **Model 2** and **Model 3**; the table also shows a blank/emdash row where Hispanic would be.
- **True (Table 1)**: Hispanic **is included** in both models:
  - Demographic: **-0.029**
  - Political intolerance: **0.031**

**How to fix**
- Ensure `hispanic` is actually in the regression formula/design matrix and not being removed due to:
  1) perfect collinearity (e.g., you included a full set of race dummies *and* an intercept), or  
  2) coding mistakes (e.g., `hispanic` is constant in the estimation sample), or  
  3) an “include/exclude” filter in code that mistakenly flags it false.
- If race is coded with dummies, use **one omitted reference category** (e.g., White as the reference), and include **black, hispanic, other_race** only (with intercept). That should keep all three estimable.
- Verify `hispanic` varies in the analysis sample: `df.loc[mask, 'hispanic'].value_counts()`.

### B. **Occupational prestige term name differs (not fatal, but must match the PDF naming)**
- **Generated term**: `prestg80`
- **True label**: “Occupational prestige”

**How to fix**
- Either relabel `prestg80` to “Occupational prestige” in the output table, or map variable labels consistently in a codebook-driven table builder.

## 2) Coefficient (standardized beta) mismatches — by model

All coefficients below are **standardized** in the true Table 1. Your generated betas are close for a few terms, but many are off.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.310*** | **-0.322*** | coefficient differs |
| income_pc | -0.038 | **-0.037** | small difference |
| prestg80 | 0.025 | **0.016** | coefficient differs |
| Constant | 10.848 | **10.920** | differs |
| R² | 0.097 | **0.107** | differs |
| Adj R² | 0.094 | **0.104** | differs |
| N | 748 | **787** | differs |

**Fixes**
- Your estimation sample differs from the paper’s (N 748 vs 787). Match the paper’s **year restriction, missing-data rules, and sample construction** exactly. Any difference in listwise deletion rules or filtering will move standardized betas and fit stats.
- Confirm you’re using the same year (you reference 1993 counts), same weights (if any), and same coding/recodes.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.245*** | **-0.246*** | essentially matches |
| income_pc | -0.042 | **-0.054** | differs |
| prestg80 | 0.005 | **-0.006** | sign differs |
| female | -0.072* | **-0.083***? (true shows -0.083*) | differs |
| age | 0.099** | **0.140*** | differs (size + sig) |
| black | 0.033 | **0.029** | small difference |
| hispanic | (dropped) | **-0.029** | **missing entirely** |
| other_race | 0.004 | **0.005** | close |
| conservative_protestant | 0.085* | **0.059** | differs |
| no_religion | -0.005 | **-0.012** | differs |
| southern | 0.067 | **0.097** ** | differs (size + sig) |
| Constant | 8.780 | **8.507** | differs |
| R² | 0.122 | **0.151** | differs |
| Adj R² | 0.109 | **0.139** | differs |
| N | 696 | **756** | differs |

**Fixes**
- Same core issue: **wrong sample** (696 vs 756) + **Hispanic omitted**.
- Also check **age coding**: the paper’s standardized age effect is much larger (0.140). If you used a restricted age range, top-coded age, or treated “age” differently (e.g., age in decades vs years), the standardized beta changes.
- Confirm religion and region coding matches theirs (e.g., “Southern” definition, “Conservative Protestant” classification scheme).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.152* | **-0.151** ** | sig differs |
| income_pc | -0.013 | **-0.009** | differs |
| prestg80 | -0.009 | **-0.022** | differs |
| female | -0.098* | **-0.095*** | close |
| age | 0.040 | **0.110*** | differs a lot (and sig) |
| black | 0.075 | **0.049** | differs |
| hispanic | (dropped) | **0.031** | **missing entirely** |
| other_race | 0.057 | **0.053** | close |
| conservative_protestant | 0.076 | **0.066** | close-ish |
| no_religion | 0.017 | **0.024** | differs |
| southern | 0.065 | **0.121** ** | differs a lot (and sig) |
| political_intolerance | 0.149** | **0.164*** | differs (size + sig) |
| Constant | 7.467 | **6.516** | differs |
| R² | 0.122 | **0.169** | differs |
| Adj R² | 0.097 | **0.148** | differs |
| N | 394 | **503** | differs |

**Fixes**
- Again: wrong sample (394 vs 503) and Hispanic dropped.
- Your `political_intolerance` has **402 missing** (893→491 nonmissing), then you end up at **394** after listwise deletion. The paper ends with **503**, which strongly implies:
  - They are not starting from the same initial N (you have 893 with DV complete; their final N suggests a different starting pool), **and/or**
  - Their political intolerance variable is less missing than yours (different construction, imputation, or scale), **and/or**
  - They used different listwise deletion rules (e.g., allowed some covariate missing via mean substitution or category “missing”), though Table 1 usually implies listwise.
- Rebuild the political intolerance index exactly as in the paper (items, coding direction, allowable missing items, scale range). A different scale construction changes both missingness and standardized beta.

## 3) Standard errors: the generated table is not “wrong”, but it cannot be validated against Table 1

- **Generated output** shows a second line under each coefficient that *looks like a standard error row*, but your `coefficients_long` only contains `beta_std` and `p_raw`—no SE column is shown there. Meanwhile the **true Table 1 explicitly does not provide SEs**.

**Mismatch**
- You present SE-like numbers (e.g., under educ: `-0.310***` then `-0.038`) even though the true source has **no SEs to compare**.

**How to fix**
- If you want to match the PDF Table 1: **remove standard errors from the printed table entirely** and print **only standardized coefficients with stars**.
- If you want to keep SEs for your own reporting: clearly label them as **SEs from your re-estimation**, and do *not* claim they are “as printed” or comparable to the PDF’s Table 1.

---

## 4) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Because the true table’s stars are based on their p-values and your model/sample differs, several significance levels don’t match:

Key ones:
- **Model 3 education**: Generated `*` vs True `**`
- **Model 3 political_intolerance**: Generated `**` vs True `***`
- **Model 2 age**: Generated `**` vs True `***`
- **Model 3 age**: Generated none vs True `*`
- **Southern** in Models 2 and 3: Generated none vs True `**` in both

**How to fix**
- Significance stars will only align if:
  1) you match the **exact sample (N)**,  
  2) match **variable construction** (especially political intolerance), and  
  3) match the **estimator details** (OLS, weights if used, robust vs classical SEs—though note Table 1 doesn’t print SEs, they still used some p-value calculation internally).
- Once you match the sample and coding, compute p-values the same way (plain OLS t-tests unless the paper specifies robust/clustered).

---

## 5) Fit statistics and constants are inconsistent with the true table

All models show mismatches in:
- **Constant**
- **R² / Adjusted R²**
- **N**

These are not cosmetic: they confirm you are not reproducing the same analysis conditions.

**How to fix**
- Align your pipeline to the paper:
  - Same population/year subset
  - Same DV construction (“number of music genres disliked”—ensure identical set of genres and coding of “dislike”)
  - Same missing-data handling
  - Same covariate coding
  - Same weighting (if applicable)
- Then re-run and re-standardize coefficients (or use standardized variables before OLS).

## 6) Practical checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1) **Recreate the exact analytic sample sizes**: 787 / 756 / 503.  
   - Your Ns (748/696/394) are the biggest red flag.
2) **Fix Hispanic being dropped** by using a proper reference category for race and verifying variation.
3) **Reconstruct political intolerance** to match the paper’s index and missingness rules.
4) **Confirm age units/coding** (years vs decades; handling of top-codes).
5) **Match table formatting**: Table 1 prints **standardized coefficients only**, no SEs.
6) After matching sample + coding, recompute stars with the paper’s thresholds (*, **, ***).

If you share the code used to (a) build `num_genres_disliked` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) define the model samples, I can point to the exact step causing the N drop and the Hispanic exclusion.
