Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True Results (Table 1 in the PDF)**, grouped into (A) variable inclusion/name problems, (B) coefficient/significance mismatches, (C) fit statistics and constants, (D) standard errors/reporting, and (E) interpretation. For each, I say how to fix it so the generated analysis reproduces Table 1.

---

## A) Variable inclusion and naming mismatches

### A1) **“black” is missing/NaN in Generated Models 2 and 3**
- **Generated** (`coefficients_long`): `black` appears with `beta_std = NaN`, `p_std = NaN`, `included = False`.
- **True (Table 1)**: Black is included in Models 2 and 3 with coefficients:
  - Model 2: **0.029**
  - Model 3: **0.049**

**How to fix**
- You are likely dropping `black` due to a coding/typing problem (e.g., all values identical after filtering, wrong column name, or it’s being treated as a non-numeric category and silently excluded).
- Ensure `black` is **present in the regression design matrix** and numeric (0/1).
  - If race is represented via multiple dummies, ensure you create **exactly the same dummy set and reference category** as the paper.
  - Verify after listwise deletion that `black` still has variation (both 0 and 1). If not, your sample restriction is wrong (see Section C3 on N).

## B) Coefficient (standardized beta) and significance mismatches (by model)

### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.310*** | **-0.322*** | coefficient differs |
| income_pc | -0.038 (ns) | -0.037 (ns) | essentially matches (rounding) |
| prestg80 | 0.025 (ns) | 0.016 (ns) | coefficient differs |
| R² | 0.097 | 0.107 | mismatch |
| N | 748 | 787 | mismatch |

**How to fix**
- The beta differences (educ, prestg80) and R²/N differences strongly suggest your **estimation sample or variable construction differs** from the paper:
  1. Reproduce the paper’s **exact sample selection** (year, age limits if any, valid-response filters).
  2. Reproduce the paper’s **exact standardization method**:
     - Standardized OLS betas can be obtained either by (i) z-scoring variables and using unstandardized OLS, or (ii) converting from unstandardized coefficients using SD ratios. Both match if done correctly, but discrepancies happen if you standardize on a different sample than the model’s estimation sample.
  3. Reproduce the paper’s **exact variable operationalization** for:
     - `income_pc` (household income per capita): equivalence scale? household size? top-coding? inflation adjustment? log vs. level?
     - `prestg80` (occupational prestige): treatment of missing, retirees, unemployed, etc.

### Model 2 (Demographic)

Key mismatches:

| Variable | Generated beta (sig) | True beta (sig) | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.295*** | **-0.246*** | coefficient too negative |
| female | -0.085 (p≈.051; borderline) | **-0.083*** | sig marker differs (paper prints *) |
| age | 0.084 (ns) | **0.140*** | coefficient far too small + wrong sig |
| black | **excluded/NaN** | 0.029 | missing variable |
| other_race | 0.025 | 0.005 | coefficient differs |
| conservative_protestant | 0.083 | 0.059 | coefficient differs |
| southern | 0.074 (ns) | **0.097** ** | coefficient + sig differ |
| constant | 10.403 | 8.507 | big mismatch |
| R² | 0.147 | 0.151 | slightly low |
| N | 476 | 756 | massive mismatch |

**How to fix**
- The **huge N gap (476 vs 756)** is the main red flag: your Model 2 listwise deletion is removing ~280 more cases than the paper.
  - In your missingness table, `hispanic` has **298 missing**. In the paper, Model 2 still has N=756, so `hispanic` in the paper is *not* missing for 298 cases in the analytic sample, or they are not listwise-deleting those cases as you are.
- Likely issue: you coded `hispanic` (and maybe race) incorrectly, e.g.:
  - treating “not asked / inapplicable” as NA instead of 0,
  - pulling `hispanic` from a different wave/module,
  - constructing Hispanic as a stand-alone variable with many missings instead of deriving it from a single race/ethnicity scheme used in the paper.

Concrete fixes:
1. **Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies exactly as the paper does.**
   - Usually: mutually exclusive categories (e.g., White reference, Black, Hispanic, Other).
   - If so, *Hispanic should not be missing for hundreds of cases*—it should be derivable for almost everyone with valid race/ethnicity.
2. **Do not listwise-delete on variables that the paper did not use or did not treat as missing.**
   - If “Hispanic” is missing because the respondent is non-Hispanic and you stored that as NA, recode to 0.
3. Once the sample is corrected, re-estimate and re-standardize. The age and education betas should move toward **0.140*** (age) and **-0.246*** (educ), and southern should become **0.097**.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated beta (sig) | True beta (sig) | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.180***? (table shows *) | **-0.151** | coefficient + sig mismatch |
| income_pc | -0.061 (ns) | -0.009 (ns) | coefficient far too negative |
| female | **-0.125*** | **-0.095*** | coefficient too negative |
| age | 0.066 (ns) | **0.110*** | too small + wrong sig |
| black | excluded/NaN | 0.049 | missing variable |
| hispanic | -0.026 | 0.031 | sign differs |
| southern | 0.084 (ns) | **0.121** | too small + wrong sig |
| political_intolerance | 0.168* | **0.164*** | sig mismatch (should be ***) |
| constant | 8.660 | 6.516 | mismatch |
| R² | 0.132 | 0.169 | mismatch |
| N | 269 | 503 | massive mismatch |

**How to fix**
- Again, **N is dramatically too small**. Your missingness shows `political_intolerance` has 402 missing (only 491 nonmissing), and after also losing cases to `hispanic` missingness you end at 269. The paper has **503** cases, meaning:
  - either political intolerance is measured differently in the paper (different items/scale construction, more available cases),
  - or they allow partial item nonresponse (e.g., compute the scale if ≥k items answered), whereas you require complete data or are using the wrong threshold.

Concrete fixes:
1. **Match the paper’s political intolerance scale construction.**
   - Your diagnostics mention `polintol_min_answered_used = 15`, suggesting you required answering all 15 items; that will shrink N a lot.
   - The paper likely uses a **less strict rule** (e.g., mean of answered items with a minimum like 8/15) or uses an already-constructed scale variable with better coverage.
2. Fix Hispanic/race coding (same as Model 2) so you don’t unnecessarily drop cases.
3. After matching the sample and scale, re-run: R² should rise to ~0.169 and political intolerance should have *** significance (and age/southern should become significant and larger).

## C) Fit statistics, constants, and sample sizes

### C1) **All three constants are wrong**
- **Generated constants**: 10.848, 10.403, 8.660
- **True constants**: 10.920, 8.507, 6.516

**Why this happens**
- If you’re reporting a constant from a model on **standardized variables**, the intercept has a different meaning (often ~0 if DV is standardized). But your intercepts are large, suggesting DV is unstandardized and predictors maybe standardized—still, the intercept will be sample-dependent.
- The much higher constants in Models 2 and 3 align with your samples being *different* (and much smaller), shifting the mean DV.

**Fix**
- Ensure you are using the **same estimation sample** (N) as the paper and the **same DV scaling**.
- If Table 1 uses standardized betas but unstandardized intercept, compute standardized betas while keeping the model otherwise identical (same DV, same sample).

### C2) **R² and Adjusted R² do not match**
- Model 1: 0.097 vs 0.107
- Model 3: 0.132 vs 0.169 (big)

**Fix**
- Almost certainly sample/variable construction differences; R² is very sensitive to those. Once N and variable coding match, R² should align closely.

### C3) **N is wrong in every model**
- Generated vs True:
  - Model 1: 748 vs 787
  - Model 2: 476 vs 756
  - Model 3: 269 vs 503

**Fix**
- Audit the pipeline that creates the analytic dataset:
  1. Apply the paper’s **same base sample restriction** first.
  2. Construct all variables.
  3. Apply **model-specific** missing-data handling consistent with the paper (likely listwise deletion, but only after variables are constructed correctly).
- Your biggest avoidable losses are from `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` construction/NA rules.

---

## D) Standard errors: Generated table prints SEs, but True Table 1 has none

### D1) You are showing standard errors that cannot be validated against Table 1
- **Generated `table1_style`** includes a second line per coefficient that looks like SEs.
- **True**: explicitly says **Table 1 does not print standard errors**.

**Fix**
- If your goal is to match Table 1, **remove SEs from the presentation** (or add a note: “SEs not reported in original table”).
- If you must include SEs, you need to obtain them from the authors’ replication materials or recompute from the same data—but you still won’t be able to claim they match Table 1 because Table 1 doesn’t report them.

---

## E) Interpretation/significance-coding mismatches

### E1) Significance stars differ for multiple variables
Examples:
- Model 3 `political_intolerance`: Generated `*` vs True `***`
- Model 3 `educ`: Generated `*` vs True `**`
- Model 2/3 `age`: Generated ns vs True significant
- Model 2/3 `southern`: Generated ns vs True `**`

**Fix**
- Once coefficients and N match, p-values will likely match too.
- Also confirm you’re using the same:
  - two-tailed tests (paper says two-tailed),
  - alpha thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001),
  - standard error type (classical OLS vs robust). If you used robust SEs, p-values can differ even if betas match.

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Recreate the analytic sample** so N matches: 787 / 756 / 503.
2. **Fix race/ethnicity coding** so `black` is included and `hispanic` is not massively missing.
3. **Reconstruct political intolerance** using the same item set and missing-data rule as the paper (do not require 15/15 if the paper didn’t).
4. **Compute standardized betas exactly as in the paper** (standardize within each model’s estimation sample).
5. **Present results like Table 1**: standardized coefficients + stars; do not print SEs (or clearly separate them as additional information not in the original).

If you share the code (or just how you constructed `hispanic`, `black`, and `political_intolerance`, plus your sample filters), I can pinpoint the exact step that causes the N collapses and the NaN “black” term.
