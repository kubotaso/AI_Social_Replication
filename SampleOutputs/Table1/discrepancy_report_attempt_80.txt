============================================================

Below is a full item-by-item audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, grouped by (a) model fit, (b) coefficients/significance, (c) variable naming/coding, and (d) interpretation/reporting. I also explain exactly how to fix each issue so the generated output matches Table 1.

---

## 1) Sample size and model-fit statistics: all three models mismatch

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your model 1 estimation is dropping too many cases. Ensure Model 1 is run on the Table 1 sample (likely listwise deletion only on Model 1 variables: outcome + educ + inc_pc + prestige), not on additional variables used in later models.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, **Adj. R² = 0.085**
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, **Adj. R² = 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once you match the correct sample (N=787) and correct variable construction, recompute. R² will change with sample and any recoding differences.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** You are almost certainly (implicitly) requiring non-missingness on variables that are *not* in Model 2 (most likely **pol_intol**, which has ~47% missingness in your missingness table). Model 2 should not be restricted by political intolerance.
  - Concretely: build the analysis dataset separately per model:
    - Model 2 complete cases on: outcome + SES vars + demographics + religion + south.
    - Do **not** filter on `pol_intol` until Model 3.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.138**, **Adj. R² = 0.119**
  - True: **R² = 0.151**, **Adj. R² = 0.139**
  - **Fix:** This will largely correct when you (i) use the right N/sample and (ii) match the paper’s coding/standardization conventions (see below).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Same root cause: your analysis is using a much smaller complete-case subset than the paper. Likely differences:
    1) You are listwise-deleting on additional items (e.g., component variables used to *construct* `pol_intol`) rather than on the final scale.
    2) You may be inadvertently requiring non-missingness on `hispanic` (which shows 35% missing in your report—this is a red flag; race/ethnicity dummies in GSS typically shouldn’t be missing at that scale).
  - To match Table 1: replicate the paper’s construction of the intolerance scale and dummy coding, and apply listwise deletion only on the variables in Model 3 (not extra upstream items unless the paper did).

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.149**, **Adj. R² = 0.112**
  - True: **R² = 0.169**, **Adj. R² = 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Correcting N and variable construction should move these toward the true values.

## 2) Coefficients (β) and significance: many mismatches by model

**Key point:** The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except constants). Your “table1style” outputs appear to use your computed `beta`, which is the right *type* of statistic—but your values and stars often do not match the true table, indicating sample/coding problems.

### Model 1: SES coefficients (β)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | coefficient too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | small numeric mismatch |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | mismatch |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | mismatch |

**Fixes:**
- Use the correct Model 1 sample (N=787).
- Ensure the dependent variable is exactly “**number of music genres disliked**” as defined in the paper (your missingness shows `num_genres_disliked`, but confirm it matches the paper’s constructed DV).
- Confirm that β is computed as the standardized slope (i.e., run OLS on z-scored variables or compute β from unstandardized b using SD ratios). Any weighting differences (see §4) can also shift β.

### Model 2: Demographic coefficients (β) and stars
| Variable | Generated β (stars) | True β (stars) | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.266*** | -0.246*** | coefficient mismatch |
| Income pc | -0.053 | -0.054 | tiny mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.010 | -0.006 | mismatch |
| Female | -0.086* | -0.083* | tiny mismatch |
| **Age** | **0.103***? (you show 0.103*) | **0.140*** | coefficient and significance too low |
| Black | 0.051 | 0.029 | mismatch |
| **Hispanic** | **0.030** | **-0.029** | **sign flips** |
| **Other race** | **-0.022** | **0.005** | sign/size mismatch |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.082 | 0.059 | mismatch |
| No religion | -0.017 | -0.012 | mismatch |
| **Southern** | **0.064 (ns)** | **0.097** ** | coefficient and significance mismatch |
| Constant | 9.489 | 8.507 | mismatch |

**Fixes (likely causes):**
1) **You used the wrong sample (major)**: Generated N=507 vs true N=756 will distort age, region, and ethnicity effects and their p-values.
2) **Race/ethnicity coding is inconsistent with the paper** (sign flips for Hispanic; “Other race” negative vs near zero).
   - Ensure mutually exclusive race categories with the same reference group as the paper (almost certainly **White** as omitted category).
   - Ensure Hispanic is coded the same way as the paper (in GSS, “Hispanic” is sometimes ethnicity separate from race; the paper may treat Hispanic as a category possibly overriding race or using a specific recode).
3) **Southern**: likely coded differently (e.g., South vs non-South based on region variable vs census region; or missingness/weights shifting it).

### Model 3: Political intolerance coefficients (β) and stars
| Variable | Generated β (stars) | True β (stars) | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | star mismatch (p-value too big in your run) |
| Income pc | -0.054 | -0.009 | **large mismatch** |
| Prestige | -0.014 | -0.022 | mismatch |
| Female | -0.128* | -0.095* | mismatch |
| Age | 0.090 (ns) | 0.110* | mismatch + star mismatch |
| Black | 0.071 | 0.049 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | -0.033 | 0.031 | sign flip |
| Other race | 0.049 | 0.053 | close |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.039 | 0.066 | mismatch |
| No religion | 0.025 | 0.024 | close |
| **Southern** | **0.068 (ns)** | **0.121** ** | coefficient + star mismatch |
| **Political intolerance** | **0.185** ** | **0.164*** | coefficient and stars mismatch |
| Constant | 7.763 | 6.516 | mismatch |

**Fixes:**
- **Sample alignment is critical**: Generated N=286 vs true N=503 will strongly affect coefficients and especially significance.
- **Political intolerance scale construction** must match the paper:
  - Same items, same coding direction, same range, same handling of missing items.
  - Your label says “(0–15)” but the paper reports a standardized β and doesn’t emphasize range; you need the *same underlying scale* to get β comparable.
- **Income pc**: your β (-0.054) is nowhere near the true (-0.009). That suggests either:
  - income is scaled differently (e.g., raw dollars vs categories vs logged), or
  - the “per capita” transformation differs (household size adjustment), or
  - the wrong variable was used (inc_pc vs total income), or
  - sample restriction is severely biasing it.
  - **Fix:** replicate the paper’s exact income-per-capita construction and scaling.

## 3) Standard errors: generated output reports SE/p-values; Table 1 does not

- Generated output includes **p-values and sig stars** derived from them.
- True Table 1: **no SE reported**, only stars.

This is not a “numerical mismatch” per se, but it creates **interpretive mismatches**:
- Your stars are based on your model’s p-values; the paper’s stars are based on *their* p-values from *their* sample/coding/possibly weights.
- **Fix:** If your goal is to match Table 1, you should:
  1) stop presenting SE/p in the “Table 1 style” output (or mark them as not applicable), and
  2) only present β and stars *after* you’ve replicated their sample/coding/weights so the stars align.

---

## 4) Interpretation/reporting mismatches: what your generated table implies vs what Table 1 says

### A. You implicitly treat coefficients as “standardized β” correctly—but your constants are inconsistent
- The paper: constants are **unstandardized** and reported as-is.
- You report constants, but they don’t match in any model.
- **Fix:** constants will align only if:
  - DV is identical,
  - the unstandardized model uses the same coding,
  - same weighting/estimation, and
  - same sample.

### B. The biggest substantive interpretation errors caused by mismatches
1) **Hispanic effect changes sign** (Model 2 and Model 3).
   - Generated implies Hispanic increases disliked genres in Model 2 (β=+0.030), decreases in Model 3 (β=-0.033).
   - True results: Hispanic is slightly negative in Model 2 (β=-0.029) and positive in Model 3 (β=+0.031).
   - **Fix:** race/ethnicity coding and/or sample is wrong.

2) **Southern effect is understated and loses significance**
   - Generated: small, non-significant Southern in Models 2 and 3.
   - True: Southern is **positive and significant** in both (Model2 **; Model3 **).
   - **Fix:** South coding, sample, and/or weights.

3) **Political intolerance significance level is wrong**
   - Generated: β=0.185** (p≈0.0036)
   - True: β=0.164*** (p<.001)
   - **Fix:** match sample (N=503), scale construction, and any weights; then stars should become *** and β move closer.

## 5) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1) **Recreate the paper’s analytic samples per model (do not reuse the smallest sample)**
   - Model 1: listwise delete on DV + (educ, inc_pc, prestige) only → target N=787
   - Model 2: listwise delete on DV + all Model 2 covariates (exclude pol_intol) → target N=756
   - Model 3: listwise delete on DV + all Model 3 covariates (include pol_intol) → target N=503

2) **Verify the dependent variable construction**
   - Confirm `num_genres_disliked` exactly equals the paper’s “Number of Music Genres Disliked” (same items, same missing handling, same range).

3) **Match variable coding to the paper**
   - Race/ethnicity: ensure categories and reference group match.
     - Likely dummy variables: Black, Hispanic, Other (ref=White non-Hispanic). But confirm how Hispanic interacts with race in the paper.
   - South: ensure definition matches (Census South vs “South” based on a different regional scheme).
   - Religion: confirm “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” definitions.

4) **Match scaling/transformations**
   - Income per capita: replicate exact per-capita computation and any transformations (e.g., log, rescale).
   - Political intolerance: replicate exact index composition and scoring.

5) **Use the same estimation conventions**
   - Check whether the paper uses **weights** (common in GSS analyses). If Table 1 is weighted and your run is unweighted, β and R² will differ.
   - Use the same OLS settings (no robust SE if paper used conventional OLS; but stars depend on SE choice).

6) **Generate Table 1 output the way the paper does**
   - Report **standardized β** for predictors, **unstandardized constant**, **R²**, **Adj R²**, **N**, and stars using the paper’s thresholds.

If you want, paste your code (or at least: how you recoded race/Hispanic, constructed `inc_pc`, constructed `pol_intol`, and filtered missingness per model). With that, I can pinpoint the exact line(s) causing the N collapse (507/286) and the Hispanic/Southern sign and significance reversals.
