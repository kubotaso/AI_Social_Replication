Score: 20/100
============================================================

### 1) Outcome / variable naming mismatches

- **DV name mismatch**
  - **Generated DV:** `music_exclusive` (shown in model_frames).
  - **True DV:** *Number of music genres disliked*.
  - **Fix:** Rebuild the dependent variable to match the paper’s construction (count of genres disliked) and name it accordingly (e.g., `num_genres_disliked`). Do **not** substitute a different scale (like “exclusive” tastes) or a different count.

- **Predictor naming mostly OK but must match coding**
  - Generated uses: `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south`, `pol_intol`.
  - These correspond to the table labels, but the *coding* is clearly not matching (see NaNs and sample size collapse below).
  - **Fix:** Ensure these are coded identically to the paper (especially race/ethnicity, religion, region, and political intolerance construction).

---

### 2) Fit statistics and sample size mismatches (major)

#### Model 1
- **Generated n = 793** vs **True n = 787** (mismatch)
- **Generated R² = 0.107613; adj R² = 0.104220** vs **True R² = 0.107; adj R² = 0.104** (close; rounding OK)
- **Fix:** Apply the *same missing-data rule* as the paper. The paper’s n=787 indicates additional exclusions beyond what your Model 1 frame used (or you included extra valid cases). Harmonize by:
  1) using the same GSS year/subsample (1993),
  2) applying the same valid-range filters / recodes,
  3) listwise deletion on the exact variables in Model 1.

#### Model 2
- **Generated n = 37** vs **True n = 756** (catastrophic mismatch)
- **Generated R² = 0.489; adj R² = 0.343** vs **True R² = 0.151; adj R² = 0.139** (not comparable because n is wrong)
- **Fix:** Your Model 2 design matrix is collapsing to 37 cases because of missingness/coding errors—confirmed by `NaN` coefficients for `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `norelig`.
  - Recode categorical variables properly (see Section 4).
  - Ensure they are numeric and not all-missing after recode.
  - Then run OLS on the full analytic sample; you should get hundreds of cases (≈756).

#### Model 3
- **Generated n = 19** vs **True n = 503** (catastrophic mismatch)
- **Generated R² = 0.588; adj R² = 0.176** vs **True R² = 0.169; adj R² = 0.148**
- **Fix:** Same issue, worse: adding `pol_intol` leaves only 19 complete cases. You must reconstruct `pol_intol` the same way as the paper and handle missing codes correctly, then listwise delete on Model 3 variables to reach ≈503.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (direction, magnitude, and signs)

#### Model 1 (SES)
True standardized betas (β): Educ -0.322***, Inc -0.037, Prestige 0.016; Constant 10.920  
Generated: Educ -0.3297*** (close), Inc -0.0336 (close), Prestige 0.0291 (too high), Constant 10.833 (off)

- **Education:** close enough (likely rounding/sample difference).
- **Income:** close enough.
- **Prestige:** **generated 0.029 vs true 0.016** (mismatch).
- **Constant:** **10.833 vs 10.920** (mismatch).
- **Fix:** Once n is corrected to 787 and the DV matches (“disliked”), prestige and intercept should move toward the paper values. Also ensure:
  - you are reporting **standardized** coefficients for predictors (see Section 5),
  - constants are **unstandardized**.

#### Model 2 (Demographic) — generated results are fundamentally wrong
True (selected): Educ -0.246***; Inc -0.054; Prestige -0.006; Female -0.083*; Age 0.140***; South 0.097**; Constant 8.507  
Generated: Educ -0.795**; Inc +0.182; Prestige +0.425*; Female +0.077; Age -0.018; South +0.224; Constant 8.690

Mismatches:
- **Education magnitude wildly off** (-0.796 vs -0.246).
- **Income sign wrong** (+0.182 vs -0.054).
- **Prestige sign wrong** (+0.425 vs -0.006).
- **Female sign wrong** (+0.077 vs -0.083).
- **Age sign wrong** (-0.018 vs +0.140).
- **South magnitude/significance wrong** (and n is tiny).
- **Fix:** These are exactly what you’d expect from (a) wrong DV, (b) n=37 selection artifact, and (c) not using standardized coefficients. Fix the sample and standardization first; then check coding of gender, age scaling, and region.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance) — generated results are fundamentally wrong
True: Educ -0.151**; Inc -0.009; Prestige -0.022; Female -0.095*; Age 0.110*; South 0.121**; Pol intolerance 0.164***; Constant 6.516  
Generated: Educ -0.284; Inc +0.207; Prestige +0.511; Female +0.206; Age +0.148; South +0.218; Pol intolerance +0.313; Constant -7.185

Mismatches:
- **Intercept totally wrong** (-7.19 vs +6.52) → strong evidence the DV is not the same and/or model is not comparable (and n=19).
- **Income sign wrong**; **prestige sign wrong**; **female sign wrong**.
- **Political intolerance coefficient not comparable** (n=19, likely different scale/coding).
- **Fix:** Rebuild `pol_intol` exactly as in the paper and recover n≈503; standardize predictors; ensure DV is “disliked”.

---

### 4) “NaN” coefficients indicate model matrix problems (must fix)

Generated tables show `NaN` for:
- `hispanic`, `otherrace` (Models 2 & 3)
- `norelig` (Models 2 & 3)

This typically happens when a column is:
- all missing after filtering,
- constant (no variance) within the tiny retained sample,
- perfectly collinear with other dummies (dummy-variable trap / reference category mis-specification).

**Fixes:**
1) **Recode GSS missing values** (often 8/9/98/99 etc.) to actual NA before analysis.
2) **Create race/ethnicity dummies correctly** with a clear reference group (usually White as reference). Include *k-1* dummies, not all categories.
   - Example: include `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, and omit `white`.
3) **Religion variable:** ensure `norelig` is a valid binary indicator and that `cons_prot` is defined as in the paper (often a composite from denomination/fundamentalism measures). Don’t inadvertently code almost everyone as missing.
4) After recodes, **verify variance**:
   - `df[['hispanic','otherrace','norelig']].mean()`, `nunique()`, missingness counts.

---

### 5) Standardized coefficients vs unstandardized (interpretation mismatch)

- **True table reports standardized OLS coefficients (β) for predictors.** Constants are unstandardized. SEs are not reported.
- **Generated output claims `beta` but it is almost certainly unstandardized slopes** (and you also compute p-values/SEs).
  - Evidence: magnitudes like `prestg80 = 0.425` and `inc_pc = 0.182` in Model 2 are implausible as standardized betas given typical scaling, and the intercept in Model 3 is nonsensical relative to the DV scale shown elsewhere.
- **Fix:** To match the paper:
  1) **Standardize all continuous predictors** (and usually binary predictors too if the table reports fully standardized betas; the paper appears to treat all as standardized coefficients).
     - Practically: run OLS on z-scored X’s (and keep y unstandardized if you want the constant in original units).
  2) **Report standardized coefficients only** and **do not report SEs** (or mark as not reported), because the “true results” table has no SEs.

---

### 6) Significance stars / inference mismatch

- Generated significance is computed from your (incorrect) tiny samples and wrong specification; stars therefore don’t match.
- True stars correspond to the paper’s full sample and standardized model.
- **Fix:** Once:
  - DV is correct,
  - n matches (≈787/756/503),
  - predictors are coded correctly and standardized,
  - listwise deletion matches the paper,
  
  then recompute p-values and apply the same two-tailed thresholds (*, **, ***) used in the paper.

---

### 7) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the “true” table

1) **Construct the correct DV**: count of “music genres disliked” exactly as in the article (same items, same coding of “dislike,” same handling of “don’t know/NA”).
2) **Use the 1993 GSS sample** and reproduce the paper’s inclusion/exclusion rules.
3) **Recode missing values** for all predictors before listwise deletion.
4) **Create race/ethnicity and religion indicators correctly** with a proper reference category and no collinearity.
5) **Rebuild `pol_intol`** to match the paper’s index/scale and missing-data handling.
6) **Standardize predictors** (to obtain β) while keeping the intercept unstandardized.
7) **Run three OLS models** with **the exact covariate sets** and then verify:
   - n equals 787 / 756 / 503,
   - R² approximately 0.107 / 0.151 / 0.169,
   - coefficient signs match (notably: education negative; income negative; female negative; age positive; south positive; political intolerance positive).

If you share the code used to build `music_exclusive` and `pol_intol` (and the missing-value recodes), I can pinpoint exactly which recode/filter step is causing the n=37 and n=19 collapses and the NaN columns.
