Score: 42/100
============================================================

Below is every discrepancy I can see between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1 in the PDF)**, grouped by (A) fit statistics/sample size, (B) variable names, (C) standardized coefficients + stars, (D) constants, and (E) interpretation/reporting problems. For each, I note how to fix it so the generated output matches the published table.

---

## A) Fit statistics and N: mismatches

### 1) **N differs in all three models**
- **True N:** Model 1 = **787**, Model 2 = **756**, Model 3 = **503**
- **Generated N:** Model 1 = **758**, Model 2 = **523**, Model 3 = **343**

**Why this is a problem:** Your generated regressions are being estimated on much smaller (and different) subsets than the paper’s models, which will mechanically change coefficients, R², constants, and p-values.

**How to fix**
- Replicate the paper’s **exact sample restrictions and missing-data handling**.
- Your “missingness” tables show massive missingness for `hispanic` (281) and `polintol` (312), which is likely due to **coding errors** (e.g., treating nonresponse codes as NA incorrectly, or constructing `hispanic`/`polintol` from variables with special codes but not recoding them).
- Ensure you:
  1. Recode all “don’t know/refused/not applicable” codes to the same missing definition used by the paper.
  2. Construct race/ethnicity variables correctly (see section B).
  3. Use the same listwise deletion rule as the paper (usually listwise per model), *after* correct recodes.

---

### 2) **R² and Adjusted R² do not match**
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R² **0.107**, Adj R² **0.104**  
  - Model 2 R² **0.151**, Adj R² **0.139**  
  - Model 3 R² **0.169**, Adj R² **0.148**
- **Generated:**  
  - Model 1 R² **0.108770**, Adj **0.105224** (close but not exact)  
  - Model 2 R² **0.158211**, Adj **0.140090** (R² too high)  
  - Model 3 R² **0.150331**, Adj **0.119434** (too low)

**How to fix**
- First fix **N/sample construction** (above). R² will not match until the same cases and same variable coding are used.
- Also confirm the dependent variable matches exactly (see section E).

---

## B) Variable name / construction mismatches

### 3) **Dependent variable name mismatch: `exclusiveness` vs “Number of music genres disliked”**
- Generated missingness tables include `exclusiveness` as a model variable.
- True DV is **Number of music genres disliked** (the table’s outcome). The generated output never explicitly names the DV in the regression tables, but the presence of `exclusiveness` suggests you may be modeling the wrong outcome or misnaming it.

**How to fix**
- Ensure the outcome variable is exactly the count index used in the paper (number of genres disliked), with the same coding and range.
- If `exclusiveness` is your internal name for that outcome, rename it in outputs to match the paper, and ensure its construction matches the paper’s index.

---

### 4) `inc_pc` may not match “Household income per capita” definition
Even small coefficient differences can be driven by:
- using household income not per-capita,
- per-capita computed with a different household-size variable,
- income coded in different units (e.g., categories vs dollars).

**How to fix**
- Verify the exact construction: **household income per capita = household income / household size** (or equivalent) consistent with the paper.
- Confirm whether the paper standardized before estimation or standardized betas were computed post hoc.

---

### 5) Race/ethnicity coding likely wrong (driving huge missingness for `hispanic`)
- Generated: `hispanic` has **281 missing**, meaning ~31% missing.
- In most survey datasets, Hispanic ethnicity is not missing for 31% unless miscoded (e.g., recoding “not Hispanic” to missing, or not combining race + ethnicity correctly).

**How to fix**
- Recreate `hispanic` as a binary indicator using the dataset’s ethnicity question, and **do not** treat “No” as missing.
- If the paper uses mutually exclusive race categories (Black, Hispanic, Other race, with White as reference), ensure you:
  - define **Hispanic** based on ethnicity regardless of race *if that is how the paper did it*, or
  - follow the paper’s stated rule for mutually exclusive categories.

---

### 6) `polintol` missingness extremely high (312; 35%)
- This is likely not “true missing” but due to:
  - failure to recode special codes,
  - not constructing the index the same way (dropping if any item missing vs allowing partial).

**How to fix**
- Rebuild the political intolerance scale exactly as described (items, coding direction, averaging/summing rule, and missing-data rule).
- If the paper allows scale computation with partial completion (e.g., mean of non-missing items when at least k items answered), implement that rather than strict listwise.

---

## C) Standardized coefficients (betas) + significance stars: all mismatches

Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only**. Your `table1_style_betas` and `beta_std` should match those values (within rounding). They don’t.

Below I list **True beta** vs **Generated beta**:

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | **-0.332*** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.037 | **-0.034** | slightly off |
| Occ prestige | 0.016 | **0.029** | too positive |
| Constant | 10.920 | **11.086** | too high |

**Fix:** correct sample (N should be 787) + variable construction/standardization procedure.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | **-0.301*** | far too negative |
| Income pc | -0.054 | **-0.057** | close |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | **-0.005** | close |
| Female | -0.083* | **-0.076** (no star) | star + magnitude mismatch |
| Age | 0.140*** | **0.110*** (actually generated shows 0.110* in betas table but p shows *) | magnitude + star mismatch |
| Black | 0.029 | **0.037** | off |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **-0.033** | close |
| Other race | 0.005 | **-0.011** | sign flips |
| Cons Prot | 0.059 | **0.034** | too small |
| No religion | -0.012 | **-0.017** | close |
| Southern | 0.097** | **0.079** (no **; p=0.0607) | magnitude + significance mismatch |
| Constant | 8.507 | **10.087** | much too high |

**Fix priorities:**
1) Fix sample/coding so N=756; 2) fix Hispanic/other race coding; 3) use the paper’s standardization approach; 4) ensure you are using the same p-value computation (but note: Table 1 stars are based on their model’s SEs; if your sample differs, stars will differ).

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | **-0.157***? (generated shows -0.157* in betas table; p=0.0169 so *) | star mismatch (** vs *) |
| Income pc | -0.009 | **-0.075** | huge mismatch |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | **0.015** | sign flips |
| Female | -0.095* | **-0.118***? (p=0.0239 so *) | magnitude mismatch |
| Age | 0.110* | **0.079** | too small + loses star |
| Black | 0.049 | **0.080** | off |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | **0.013** | off |
| Other race | 0.053 | **0.032** | off |
| Cons Prot | 0.066 | **0.004** | near zero vs positive |
| No religion | 0.024 | **0.079** | too large |
| Southern | 0.121** | **0.079** | too small + loses ** |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | **0.210*** | too large |
| Constant | 6.516 | **7.256** | too high |
| R² | 0.169 | **0.150** | too low |
| N | 503 | **343** | too low |

**Fix priorities:** `polintol` construction + missing handling (to recover N=503), plus income per capita and prestige coding/standardization.

## D) Standard errors: the generated output cannot be “matched” to Table 1 as-is

### 7) Table 1 does **not** report SEs; your output implies them
- True Results explicitly: **no standard errors printed** in Table 1.
- Generated includes p-values and implicitly SEs (via regression output), but you can’t “match” SEs to Table 1 because they are not available there.

**How to fix (reporting)**
- If your goal is to reproduce Table 1, produce an output table with:
  - standardized betas only,
  - stars using your model p-values,
  - and **do not claim Table 1 contains SEs**.
- If you must include SEs, you need them from another table in the paper, an appendix, replication files, or by re-estimating the model on the identical dataset (but then they are *your* SEs, not “extracted from Table 1”).

---

## E) Interpretation/reporting mismatches and internal inconsistencies

### 8) Your “table1_style_betas” row order/labels are missing
The generated beta table has values but no variable labels, and includes NaNs. This makes it easy to misalign terms with the paper’s order.

**How to fix**
- Print variable names alongside betas in the same order as Table 1:
  Education, Income pc, Occ prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Political intolerance, Constant.

---

### 9) Significance coding differs from the paper’s printed stars
Even when coefficients are close, stars differ (e.g., Model 3 Education is ** in true but only * in generated).

**How to fix**
- Once you fix the sample and coding, stars will likely align more closely.
- Ensure you are using **two-tailed tests** and the same alpha cutoffs (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001).
- Also verify whether the paper used robust SEs or survey-adjusted SEs; that can change p-values without changing coefficients much.

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Outcome**: confirm the DV is exactly “number of music genres disliked” (correct construction and range).
2. **Recode missing values**: convert all special codes (DK/Refused/NA) consistently *before* creating composites.
3. **Rebuild `hispanic` and race dummies** so “not Hispanic” is not treated as missing; ensure the same reference group as the paper.
4. **Rebuild `polintol`** using the paper’s index recipe and missing rule (likely the biggest driver of Model 3 N and coefficient differences).
5. **Use the same estimation details** as the paper (weights? robust/survey SEs?).
6. **Compute standardized betas the same way** (either standardize inputs before OLS or compute post-estimation; be consistent with what the paper did).
7. **Regenerate Table 1-style output**: standardized betas only + stars; don’t claim SEs were “extracted” from Table 1.

If you share the code used to construct `exclusiveness` (DV), `inc_pc`, `hispanic`, and `polintol`, I can pinpoint exactly which recode/index rule is causing the N collapses and the sign flips.
