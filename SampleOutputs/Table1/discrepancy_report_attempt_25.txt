============================================================

### A. What “generated” is reporting vs what the “true” table reports (core incompatibility)

**True Table 1 reports standardized coefficients only and does *not* report standard errors.**  
Your **generated table prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like a standard error** (e.g., educ: `-0.332***` then `-0.034`). Those SEs are not verifiable against Table 1 because **Table 1 contains none**. So every SE shown in the generated output is, by definition, **not matchable** to the “true results” source.

**Fix:** If you want to match Table 1, **remove SE rows entirely** (or replace them with blanks/“—”), and label the column as “Standardized coefficients” (beta). If you want SEs, you must compute them from the dataset and then compare to a source that actually prints SEs (not Table 1).

---

## B. Variable-name mismatches (labeling/definition mismatches)

The generated model uses internal variable names that don’t match the Table 1 printed names:

| True Table 1 name | Generated term | Status | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Education | `educ` | OK (name differs only) | In the table, **rename** `educ` → “Education”. |
| Household income per capita | `income_pc` | OK (name differs only) | Rename `income_pc` → “Household income per capita”. Also ensure construction matches the paper (see section E). |
| Occupational prestige | `prestg80` | Potential mismatch | Rename to “Occupational prestige”; verify it’s the same prestige metric/year and coding used in the paper. |
| Female | `female` | OK | Rename to “Female”. Verify coding (1=female). |
| Age | `age` | OK | Rename to “Age”. |
| Black | `black` | OK | Rename to “Black”. Verify reference group matches the paper. |
| Hispanic | `hispanic` | **Potential construction mismatch** | The generated diagnostics say `hispanic_assumed0_when_ethnic_missing=281`, meaning you set missing ethnicity to 0. That may not match the paper. Fix in section E. |
| Other race | `other_race` | OK | Rename to “Other race”. |
| Conservative Protestant | `conservative_protestant` | OK | Rename to “Conservative Protestant”. Verify classification scheme. |
| No religion | `no_religion` | OK | Rename to “No religion”. |
| Southern | `southern` | OK | Rename to “Southern”. |
| Political intolerance | `political_intolerance` | OK | Rename to “Political intolerance”. Verify scale/range (your sample shows values like 0–7). |

**Bottom line:** The *labels* can be fixed easily; the bigger problem is that some variables (especially `hispanic`, possibly `prestg80`, and `political_intolerance`) may not be constructed the way the paper did.

## C. Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I compare each coefficient shown in your generated output (from `coefficients_long`, which appears to be standardized betas) to the true Table 1 standardized coefficients.

### Model 1 (SES): mismatches

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch (Generated − True) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.322*** | -0.332*** | -0.010 |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | +0.003 |
| Occ prestige | 0.016 | 0.029 | +0.013 |
| Constant | 10.920 | 11.086 | +0.166 |
| R² | 0.107 | 0.10877 | +0.00177 |
| Adj R² | 0.104 | 0.10522 | +0.00122 |
| N | 787 | 758 | **-29 cases** |

**Interpretation:** Coefficients are close-ish but *not identical*; the **sample size differs**, so you are not replicating the same estimation sample, and that will shift standardized betas and constants.

**Fix:** Match the paper’s sample restrictions and missing-data handling (see section E). The N discrepancy is the biggest red flag.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic): mismatches

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.260*** | -0.014 |
| HH income pc | -0.054 | -0.051 | +0.003 |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | 0.007 | **sign differs** (+0.013) |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.090** | -0.007 and **star differs** |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.129*** | -0.011 |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.009 | -0.020 |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | 0.026 | **sign differs** (+0.055) |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.001 | -0.004 |
| Cons Protestant | 0.059 | 0.065 | +0.006 |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.005 | +0.007 |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.085* | -0.012 and **star differs** |
| Constant | 8.507 | 8.804 | +0.297 |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.14547 | -0.00553 |
| Adj R² | 0.139 | 0.13284 | -0.00616 |
| N | 756 | 756 | **matches** |

**Interpretation:** Here N matches, but several coefficients differ materially, especially **Hispanic (sign flip)** and **Occupational prestige (sign flip)**, and the **significance stars differ** for Female and Southern.

**Fix:** This pattern strongly suggests **coding/definition differences** for race/ethnicity and possibly prestige, and/or different standardization procedure (e.g., standardizing using full sample vs estimation sample). See sections E and F.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): mismatches

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.155** | -0.004 |
| HH income pc | -0.009 | -0.016 | -0.007 |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | -0.008 | +0.014 |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.116* | -0.021 |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.060 | **-0.050 (and significance lost)** |
| Black | 0.049 | -0.005 | **sign differs** (-0.054) |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | 0.090 | +0.059 |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.052 | ~0 |
| Cons Protestant | 0.066 | 0.051 | -0.015 |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.017 | -0.007 |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.090 | -0.031 and **stars lost** |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.172** | +0.008 and **stars differ** |
| Constant | 6.516 | 7.258 | +0.742 |
| R² | 0.169 | 0.14304 | **-0.026** |
| Adj R² | 0.148 | 0.11814 | **-0.030** |
| N | 503 | 426 | **-77 cases** |

**Interpretation:** This model is **not reproduced**: big N drop, big R² drop, multiple coefficient shifts and sign flips (Black), and major changes in inference (Age, Southern, Political intolerance stars).

**Fix:** Your `political_intolerance` variable has **402 missing out of 893**, yielding N=426 complete cases. The paper’s N is 503, so the paper either:
- used **a different construction** of political intolerance with fewer missings, and/or
- used **a different missing-data rule** (e.g., scale computed when partially missing), and/or
- used **different survey year/subsample filters**.

## D. Standard errors: every “SE” line is a mismatch relative to the true table

Because the true table does not print SEs, you cannot “match” them. Additionally, your “table1_style” second lines do **not correspond** to the p-values/stars consistently (e.g., Model 3 political_intolerance has `0.172**` but p≈0.00103 in `coefficients_long`, which would typically merit `***` under the paper’s rule p<.001; it barely misses .001, but the true table says `***` with 0.164***, so inference still won’t align).

**Fix options:**
1) **To match the PDF Table 1:** remove SEs and show only standardized betas + stars based on the paper’s thresholds.
2) **If you insist on reporting SEs anyway:** compute robust/clustered SEs per the paper’s method (if known) and compare to a source that includes SEs.

---

## E. Sample-size and missing-data discrepancies (main driver of mismatch)

### Model 1: N mismatch (787 true vs 758 generated)
Your missingness table shows missing: income_pc=71, educ=47, prestg80=33 out of 893 with DV complete. Complete cases would be 893 − (union of missing across predictors). You ended with **758**, but the paper ended with **787**.

**Likely causes:**
- You may be using **additional filters** the paper didn’t (e.g., year==1993 only?).
- You may be treating some “inapplicable” codes as missing differently than the paper.
- You may be constructing `income_pc` in a way that introduces extra missingness (e.g., dividing by household size when household size missing).

**Fix:** Recreate the paper’s exact sample definition:
- Confirm the paper’s **year(s)** and whether weights were used.
- Recode special missing values (DK/NA) exactly as the paper did.
- Check whether the paper used **listwise deletion** (likely) but with different variable availability.

### Model 3: N mismatch (503 true vs 426 generated)
This is severe and points to `political_intolerance` construction.

Your diagnostics: `polintol_nonmissing_strict15 = 491` but M3 complete cases are 426. That suggests even among those with some polintol info, many are dropped due to other covariate missingness—or you required a stricter completion rule for the scale.

**Fix:** Align the intolerance scale computation:
- If political intolerance is an index from multiple items, compute it using the paper’s rule (e.g., **mean of available items if at least X items present**, rather than requiring all items).
- Do **not** force missing ethnicity to 0 (see below), and treat “not asked” vs “missing” properly.

### Ethnicity handling error (likely)
You explicitly report: `hispanic_assumed0_when_ethnic_missing = 281`. That is a major methodological discrepancy: coding “missing” as “not Hispanic” will bias coefficients and can flip signs.

**Fix:** If Hispanic is asked only of some respondents or missing for some, then:
- Code Hispanic as missing when the source item is missing/not asked.
- Then decide: listwise delete (to match paper) or impute (if paper did). But **do not set missing to 0** unless the survey skip pattern guarantees that missing implies non-Hispanic (rare).

This single issue can plausibly explain the **Hispanic sign flip** in Model 2 and shifts in Model 3.

---

## F. Standardization procedure mismatch (another likely contributor)

The true table reports “standardized OLS coefficients.” There are multiple ways to get them:
1) Standardize all variables first (z-scores) then run OLS (no intercept or with intercept).
2) Run unstandardized OLS then convert to beta using SDs from the estimation sample.

If you standardized using:
- the **full dataset SDs** instead of the model’s estimation sample SDs, or
- handled missingness differently when computing SDs,

you will not match the printed betas.

**Fix:** Standardize **within each model’s analytic sample**:
- Build the complete-case dataset for that model.
- Compute z-scores for DV and each predictor using that model sample’s means/SDs.
- Refit OLS on z-scored variables.

---

## G. Significance-star mismatches (inference/SE method mismatch)

Examples:
- Model 2 Female: true `-0.083*`, generated `-0.090**`
- Model 2 Southern: true `0.097**`, generated `0.085*`
- Model 3 political intolerance: true `0.164***`, generated `0.172**`
- Model 3 Age: true `0.110*`, generated nonsignificant

These arise from:
- different **N** (Model 3),
- different **variable construction** (race/ethnicity, intolerance),
- possibly different **SE type** (robust vs classical),
- possibly **survey weights/design** in the paper.

**Fix:** After matching sample and variable construction, match the paper’s estimation details:
- If the paper uses weights: run weighted OLS.
- If complex survey design: use survey-adjusted SEs.
- Use the same two-tailed thresholds as printed.

## H. Concrete checklist to make generated output match the “true” Table 1

1) **Do not print SEs** (Table 1 doesn’t have them).  
2) **Rename variables** in the output to match Table 1 labels.  
3) **Rebuild `hispanic`**: do not set missing ethnicity to 0; respect skip patterns; align to paper’s coding.  
4) **Rebuild `political_intolerance`** using the paper’s scale construction rules (partial-item allowance, same range). Aim to reproduce **N=503**.  
5) **Match the analytic sample** for each model to the paper’s N (M1=787, M2=756, M3=503).  
6) **Standardize correctly**: compute standardized betas using the model-specific estimation sample.  
7) **Match estimation method**: weights/survey design/robust SEs if the paper used them (this primarily affects stars).  
8) Recompute and verify **R² and constants**—they should align once sample and coding align.

If you paste the code you used to construct `income_pc`, `hispanic`, and `political_intolerance` (and any sample filters like year restrictions), I can point to the exact lines that are producing the N drops and sign flips and propose corrected code.
