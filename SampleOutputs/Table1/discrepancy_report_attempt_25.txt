## 1) Fit statistics: all mismatches

### Model Ns
- **Mismatch:** Generated N’s are **747 / 507 / 286**; true N’s are **787 / 756 / 503**.
- **Why it’s wrong:** Your generated models are being fit on much smaller samples, especially Models 2–3, which will change β’s, p-values, and R².
- **How to fix:**
  1. Ensure you are using the **same GSS year (1993)** and the same **DV** and **coding** as the paper.
  2. Apply the paper’s **listwise deletion rule per model** (or whatever missing-data rule the paper used). Your missingness table suggests you may be listwise-deleting on variables not in a given model (see section 4).
  3. Confirm that Model 2 does **not** require `pol_intol` (it’s not in Model 2). If your pipeline pre-filters on `pol_intol`, you’ll shrink Model 2 incorrectly.

### R² and adjusted R²
- **Mismatch:**  
  - Model 1: generated **R² 0.088** vs true **0.107**  
  - Model 2: generated **0.138** vs true **0.151**  
  - Model 3: generated **0.150** vs true **0.169**
- **How to fix:** Once the **sample and variable coding match**, re-estimate OLS and recompute R² on the correct estimation sample. R² differences of this size are consistent with wrong N + coding differences.

## 2) Table 1 coefficients (standardized β): mismatches by model

### Important: what Table 1 reports
- **True:** Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**; constants are **unstandardized**; **SEs are not reported**.
- **Generated:** You report β’s in the “Table1” columns (good), but your **stars and magnitudes** often do not match the paper (because the underlying model differs).

### Model 1 (SES)
**Variable name issues**
- **Mismatch:** Paper uses “Education”; generated uses **“Education (years)”**. Substantively fine, but if you’re “matching Table 1,” keep names identical.

**Coefficients (β)**
- Education: generated **-0.292*** vs true **-0.322*** (mismatch)
- Income pc: generated **-0.039** vs true **-0.037** (small mismatch)
- Prestige: generated **0.020** vs true **0.016** (mismatch)
- Constant: generated **10.638** vs true **10.920** (mismatch)

**Fix:** correct estimation sample (N=787), verify standardization method for β (see section 5).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
**Coefficients (β)**
- Education: **-0.265*** vs **-0.246*** (mismatch)
- Income pc: **-0.056** vs **-0.054** (small mismatch)
- Prestige: **-0.012** vs **-0.006** (mismatch)
- Female: **-0.087*** vs **-0.083*** (close, mismatch)
- Age: **0.104*** vs **0.140*** (big mismatch)
- Black: **0.013** vs **0.029** (mismatch)
- Hispanic: **0.036** vs **-0.029** (**sign flip**)
- Other race: **-0.027** vs **0.005** (**sign flip**)
- Conservative Protestant: **0.081** vs **0.059** (mismatch)
- No religion: **-0.020** vs **-0.012** (mismatch)
- Southern: **0.063** vs **0.097** (mismatch)
- Constant: **9.645** vs **8.507** (mismatch)
- N and R² also wrong (above).

**Interpretation mismatch implied by sign flips**
- Your generated analysis implies Hispanics/Other race dislike *more/less* genres in the opposite direction of the paper for Hispanics and “Other race.”
- **Fix likely needed:** dummy coding / reference category problems (see section 3).

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
**Coefficients (β)**
- Education: **-0.154*** vs **-0.151**** (close; but your star is * not ** in full output; Table1 shows * — mismatch in significance)
- Income pc: **-0.058** vs **-0.009** (**large mismatch**)
- Prestige: **-0.017** vs **-0.022** (mismatch)
- Female: **-0.123*** vs **-0.095*** (mismatch)
- Age: **0.092** vs **0.110*** (mismatch, also significance)
- Black: **0.045** vs **0.049** (close)
- Hispanic: **0.059** vs **0.031** (mismatch)
- Other race: **0.050** vs **0.053** (close)
- Cons Prot: **0.032** vs **0.066** (mismatch)
- No religion: **0.017** vs **0.024** (mismatch)
- Southern: **0.073** vs **0.121** (mismatch)
- Political intolerance: **0.183** vs **0.164** (mismatch; also your stars ** vs true ***)
- Constant: **7.590** vs **6.516** (mismatch)

**Fix:** again, wrong estimation sample (N should be 503), plus likely different coding of `inc_pc` and `pol_intol`.

---

## 3) Dummy variables / reference categories: likely coding discrepancies

Your generated output includes dummies: `Black`, `Hispanic`, `Other race`, plus religion dummies `Conservative Protestant`, `No religion`, and region `Southern`.

### Race/ethnicity
- **Evidence of mismatch:** Model 2 has **Hispanic sign flip** and **Other race sign flip** relative to the paper.
- **Common causes:**
  1. **Different reference group** (e.g., paper uses White as reference; you might have a different baseline or included/defined categories differently).
  2. **Mutually exclusive vs overlapping Hispanic indicator.** In many surveys, “Hispanic” can be an ethnicity indicator that overlaps with race; the paper’s “Hispanic” row likely assumes a specific construction (often mutually exclusive categories: White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Other).
- **Fix:**
  - Recreate the paper’s race/ethnicity scheme exactly. If the paper uses mutually exclusive groups, implement:
    - `black = 1` for Black non-Hispanic
    - `hispanic = 1` for Hispanic (any race), and then set race categories accordingly (or vice versa), **but ensure mutual exclusivity** as in the paper.
  - Confirm that **White (non-Hispanic)** is the omitted category.

### Religion
- **Potential issue:** “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” depend on classification scheme (Steensland et al. style vs simple denomination codes).
- **Fix:** Use the same **religious tradition recode** the paper used, and keep the same omitted category (often “Mainline Protestant” or “Catholic,” etc.). If the omitted category differs, coefficients won’t match.

### Southern
- Usually stable, but your β is consistently smaller than the paper’s.
- **Fix:** Confirm `south` is coded the same (Census South vs respondent self-ID).

## 4) Missing data handling: your pipeline is almost certainly dropping the wrong rows

Your missingness table shows:
- DV (`num_genres_disliked`) has **713 missing** out of 1606 (44%).
- `pol_intol` has **756 missing** (47%).
- `hispanic` has **562 missing** (35%).

Given the true Ns (787/756/503), the paper is not using the same “available cases” pattern as your generated run.

**Key discrepancy:** Your Model 2 N is **507**, far below the paper’s **756**. That strongly suggests you are *accidentally requiring* variables that are not in Model 2 (most plausibly `pol_intol`) or using an overly strict complete-case filter across all variables.

**Fix:**
- For each model, do **model-specific listwise deletion**:
  - Model 1 complete cases on: DV + educ + inc_pc + prestige
  - Model 2 complete cases on: DV + Model 1 vars + gender + age + race dummies + religion dummies + south
  - Model 3 complete cases on: Model 2 vars + political intolerance
- Do **not** pre-drop based on variables not in that model.
- Re-check N after filtering; it should match (or be extremely close to) **787/756/503**.

---

## 5) Standardization / β computation: possible mismatch

The paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)**. Your “full” tables show both `b` and `beta`. That’s good, but β can differ depending on method:
- Standardize **all variables including dummies?** Some software reports standardized coefficients even for 0/1 dummies; others don’t, or the paper may standardize only continuous predictors.
- Use **sample SD from estimation sample** (must match the paper’s sample per model).

**Fix:**
- Compute β exactly as:  
  \[
  \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{\text{SD}(X_j)}{\text{SD}(Y)}
  \]
  using SDs from the **same estimation sample** for that model.
- Verify whether the paper standardized **after** listwise deletion per model (it almost certainly did implicitly, since the regression sample defines SDs).

---

## 6) Significance stars / p-value thresholds: mismatches

Even when β is close, your stars don’t match:
- Model 3 Education: generated `p=0.0288` → `*`, but true table shows `**`.
- Political intolerance: generated `p=0.0039` → `**`, true shows `***`.

**Fix:** Once sample and coding match, p-values will change. Also confirm:
- **Two-tailed tests** (paper says two-tailed).
- Same alpha cutoffs: * <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001 (you appear to use these, but current p’s don’t meet the paper’s star levels).

---

## 7) Variable label / range mismatch: political intolerance

- **Mismatch:** Generated label “Political intolerance (0–15)” but true table just “Political intolerance.”
- **Substantive risk:** If your index range differs (0–15 vs paper’s construction), β will differ. Even if standardized, construction differences change correlations and R².
- **Fix:** Rebuild the political intolerance index exactly as in the paper (items, coding direction, handling of DK/NA, summing vs averaging). Then refit Model 3.

---

## Summary of what to change so the generated analysis matches the true Table 1
1. **Use the correct dataset/year (GSS 1993) and correct DV construction** (“number of music genres disliked”).
2. **Reproduce variable recodes exactly** (race/ethnicity mutual exclusivity; religion tradition; South; political intolerance index).
3. **Apply model-specific listwise deletion** (don’t filter Model 2 on Model 3 variables).
4. **Recompute standardized β’s** using SDs from the model’s estimation sample.
5. Refit OLS and then verify: **N, R²/Adj R², β’s, and stars** align with the paper.

If you share the code you used to (a) construct DV, (b) build race/religion/political intolerance variables, and (c) filter missingness per model, I can point to the exact line(s) causing the N collapse and the Hispanic/Other-race sign reversals.
