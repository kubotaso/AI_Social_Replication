Score: 32/100
============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics: n, R², adjusted R² all mismatch

### Model 1 (SES)
- **n**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s. To match, you must replicate the paper’s listwise-deletion rules *exactly* (which variables were required nonmissing for Model 1) and the same filters (e.g., year=1993, valid responses only). Check you didn’t additionally drop on variables not in Model 1 (e.g., race/religion/political intolerance).

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.088 / 0.085**
  - True: **0.107 / 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample matches (n=787) and coefficients match (standardized βs), R² should move closer. Also ensure you are modeling the same DV coding (see interpretation section).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **n**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is a major discrepancy. You are almost certainly (a) mistakenly requiring nonmissingness on a variable that is *not* in Model 2 (most likely **pol_intol**, given your missingness table), or (b) using a different DV or different missing-value handling. Model 2 should *not* require `pol_intol` nonmissing.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.139 / 0.120**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Primarily sample alignment + correct standardized reporting.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **n**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** You are losing far too many cases beyond what `pol_intol` missingness would imply. In your missingness table, `pol_intol` has **850 nonmissing**, so you *should* have plenty of cases available. This suggests additional unintended drops (e.g., you’re intersecting with another variable with high missingness, using complete.cases over the whole dataframe, or filtering incorrectly).

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.149 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** sample + coding + standardized β output.

## 2) Variable naming/definition mismatches (conceptual, not just labels)

### Dependent variable name mismatch
- True DV: **Number of Music Genres Disliked**
- Your missingness table includes `num_genres_disliked` (good), but your “Generated Results” headers don’t explicitly tie the regression DV to that variable.
- **Fix:** Explicitly ensure all models use the exact DV used in the paper (same exclusions for “don’t know,” “not asked,” etc.). If you accidentally used a different DV (or reversed coding), coefficients/R² won’t match.

### Political intolerance variable mismatch risk
- Generated calls it **Political intolerance**; missingness table uses `pol_intol`.
- That’s fine *if* it’s the same construct and scaling as the paper.
- **Fix:** Confirm `pol_intol` is coded and scaled the same way as in the article (range, direction). A different scale won’t change standardized β, but *will* change unstandardized b, and could affect missingness if you treated special codes as valid.

### Race/religion region indicators
Your labels: Black / Hispanic / Other race; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern.
- The **signs** in your Model 2 for Hispanic and Other race differ from the paper (see below), which often signals **different reference categories** or **different dummy construction** (mutually exclusive vs overlapping indicators).
- **Fix:** Replicate dummy coding exactly:
  - Race: typically create **three mutually exclusive dummies** (Black, Hispanic, Other), with **White as reference**.
  - Religion: Conservative Protestant dummy + No religion dummy, with “other religions” as reference (as the paper likely did).
  - Region: Southern dummy with non-South reference.
If you instead coded Hispanic independent of race (allowing someone to be both Black and Hispanic) or used a different base group, signs/magnitudes will diverge.

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized β) and constants

Important: the **paper reports standardized coefficients (β)**, while your “model*_full” mixes unstandardized **b** and standardized **beta**. Comparisons should be on **beta** (except constants).

### Model 1 (SES): mismatches
Standardized betas:
- Education
  - Generated β: **-0.292***  
  - True β: **-0.322***  
  - **Mismatch magnitude:** -0.030
- Income per capita
  - Generated β: **-0.039**
  - True β: **-0.037**
  - Close (minor mismatch)
- Occupational prestige
  - Generated β: **0.020**
  - True β: **0.016**
  - Minor mismatch
Constant (unstandardized):
- Generated: **10.638**
- True: **10.920**
- **Fix:** These will usually reconcile once (a) sample matches n=787, and (b) DV and predictors are coded identically (especially how missing values are handled). Constants are sensitive to centering/coding.

### Model 2 (Demographic): mismatches
Standardized betas:
- Education: Generated **-0.265*** vs True **-0.246*** (too negative)
- Income: Generated **-0.051** vs True **-0.054** (close)
- Prestige: Generated **-0.011** vs True **-0.006** (small)
- Female: Generated **-0.085***? (you show * in table; β=-0.085) vs True **-0.083*** (close)
- **Age:** Generated **0.103*** (actually only * in your output) vs True **0.140*** (**big mismatch**)
- **Black:** Generated **0.100** vs True **0.029** (**big mismatch**)
- **Hispanic:** Generated **+0.074** vs True **-0.029** (**sign mismatch**)
- **Other race:** Generated **-0.027** vs True **+0.005** (**sign mismatch**)
- Conservative Protestant: Generated **0.087** vs True **0.059** (moderate)
- No religion: Generated **-0.015** vs True **-0.012** (close)
- **Southern:** Generated **0.061** vs True **0.097** (moderate; also significance differs: you have none, true is **)

Constant:
- Generated **8.675** vs True **8.507** (off)

**Fixes (Model 2):**
1. **Stop dropping to n=507.** That’s likely the dominant cause of these shifts (age, race effects can swing with composition).
2. **Rebuild race dummies** to match paper’s scheme (mutually exclusive, white reference). Your Hispanic/Other sign reversals are classic symptoms.
3. Verify **age**: the paper’s larger β (0.140) may reflect:
   - different age variable (e.g., age in years vs age categories treated numeric),
   - different standardization approach (see section 5),
   - or sample difference (most likely, given your n collapse).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): mismatches
Standardized betas:
- Education: Generated **-0.155***? (you show *; β=-0.155) vs True **-0.151** (close; but stars differ: true **, you have *)
- **Income:** Generated **-0.052** vs True **-0.009** (**large mismatch**)
- Prestige: Generated **-0.015** vs True **-0.022** (small)
- Female: Generated **-0.127** vs True **-0.095** (moderate)
- Age: Generated **0.091 (ns)** vs True **0.110*** (mismatch in magnitude and significance)
- Black: Generated **0.060** vs True **0.049** (close)
- **Hispanic:** Generated **-0.030** vs True **+0.031** (**sign mismatch**)
- Other race: Generated **0.053** vs True **0.053** (matches)
- Conservative Protestant: Generated **0.036** vs True **0.066** (moderate)
- No religion: Generated **0.023** vs True **0.024** (matches)
- **Southern:** Generated **0.068** vs True **0.121** (large)
- Political intolerance: Generated **0.184** (**) vs True **0.164*** (magnitude + stars mismatch)

Constant:
- Generated **7.999** vs True **6.516** (**large mismatch**)

**Fixes (Model 3):**
1. **Fix the sample (n should be 503, not 286).** Your current sample is extremely selective and likely distorts income, region, intolerance effects.
2. **Check income scaling/coding**: the huge β discrepancy for income (−0.052 vs −0.009) suggests either:
   - wrong income variable (household vs per-capita, logged vs raw),
   - or incorrect handling of income missing/special codes,
   - or sample distortion (again).
3. **Recheck Hispanic coding** (sign flips again), consistent with Model 2.

## 4) Standard errors: generated output includes them implicitly (via p), but the “true” table does not

- True results: **SE not reported**; only β and stars.
- Generated results: you report **p-values and significance** (and unstandardized b).
- This isn’t “wrong,” but it **cannot be compared** to the paper for SE because the paper doesn’t provide SE.
- **Fix:** To match the paper’s presentation, output **only standardized β (and stars)** plus constants, R², adj R², and n. Remove SE/p from the comparison table, or clearly separate “replication output” (with SE) from “paper table” (without SE).

---

## 5) Interpretation/reporting mismatches: β vs b used inconsistently

- The paper’s Table 1 coefficients are **standardized β**.
- Your “table1style” uses β (good), but your narrative/“model_full” tables prominently show **b** and β together. This increases the chance you (or downstream code) compared the wrong column.
- **Fix:** For replication matching, treat:
  - **β** as the coefficient to compare for all predictors,
  - **Constant** as unstandardized,
  - Do not compare unstandardized **b** to the paper’s β.

Also, verify your standardization method matches the paper:
- Standardized β in OLS typically means variables standardized (z-scored) and then OLS run, or computed from unstandardized b using SD ratios. These are equivalent *if* computed on the **same estimation sample**.
- **Fix:** Compute β using the estimation sample for each model (after listwise deletion for that model), not on the full dataset.

---

## 6) The single biggest mechanical error implied by your own tables: wrong listwise deletion set

Your missingness table shows `pol_intol` missing ~47%. If you inadvertently required `pol_intol` to be nonmissing for **all models**, Model 1 and Model 2 n would collapse—consistent with your too-small n’s.

- **Fix (implementation):**
  - For Model 1, filter complete cases on: DV + educ + inc_pc + prestige only.
  - For Model 2, complete cases on: DV + Model 1 vars + female + age + race dummies + religion dummies + south.
  - For Model 3, complete cases on: DV + Model 2 vars + pol_intol.
  - Do **not** do `complete.cases(data)` across the entire dataframe.

## 7) Checklist to make generated analysis match the paper

1. **Recreate the exact analysis sample** (GSS 1993; same inclusion criteria).
2. **Recode DV exactly** (valid range; handle DK/NA as missing).
3. **Construct dummies with correct reference categories** (race, religion, region), ensuring mutual exclusivity where intended.
4. **Apply listwise deletion per model**, not globally.
5. **Report standardized β only** (plus constants, R², adj R², n) to match Table 1.
6. **Recompute standardized β within each model’s estimation sample**.
7. Recheck that your final n’s match: **787**, **756**, **503**; if not, stop and diagnose before interpreting coefficients.

If you paste your variable coding rules (especially race/Hispanic construction and income definition) and the exact sample-filtering code, I can pinpoint which step is causing the n collapse and the sign flips.
