### 1) What the “true” table contains vs what the generated output contains (core discrepancy)

**True Results (PDF Table 1):**
- Reports **standardized coefficients only (betas)**.
- **Does not report standard errors** at all.
- Includes **Hispanic** in Models 2 and 3.
- Has different **N, R², Adj. R², constants, and several betas** than the generated output.

**Generated Results:**
- Produces a regression table that *looks like* “coefficient + standard error”, but:
  - the header says “table1_style” yet the rows appear to be **betas** and/or unlabeled numbers;
  - it includes **a second line per variable that is not a true SE from Table 1** (since Table 1 has none).
- Drops **hispanic** entirely (“set to 0.0 for all to avoid listwise deletion”), which guarantees mismatch with the printed table.

**Fix (structural):** If your goal is to match the PDF table, you must:
1) output **standardized betas only** (no SEs), and  
2) estimate on the **same analytic sample and coding** as the paper, including Hispanic.

## 2) Variable-name mismatches (and inclusion/exclusion problems)

### A. “Hispanic” incorrectly excluded
- **True table:** Hispanic is present in Models 2 and 3 with coefficients:
  - Model 2: **-0.029**
  - Model 3: **0.031**
- **Generated:** `hispanic` is **dropped** in Models 2 and 3 (`included=False; dropped_no_variance = hispanic`) with the rule:
  - “Not available in extract; set to 0.0 for all to avoid listwise deletion.”

**Why this is a mismatch:** Setting a variable to a constant (0 for everyone) forces **zero variance**, so OLS drops it. That’s not what the paper did.

**Fix:** Properly construct `hispanic` from the data (or, if it exists, do not overwrite it). You need a 0/1 indicator with actual variation. Then re-run Models 2 and 3.

---

### B. Variable naming differences (minor but should be aligned)
Generated uses internal names:
- `educ` vs **Education**
- `income_pc` vs **Household income per capita**
- `prestg80` vs **Occupational prestige**
- `female`, `age`, `black`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`

These aren’t inherently wrong, but your final table should **rename** them to match Table 1 labels exactly.

**Fix:** Apply a rename map at output time so labels match the PDF.

## 3) Coefficient (beta) mismatches — by model

Below I compare **standardized coefficients (betas)** since that’s what the true table reports.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | **-0.316** | **-0.322** | off by 0.006 |
| Income pc | **-0.035** | **-0.037** | off by 0.002 |
| Occ prestige | **0.025** | **0.016** | off by 0.009 |
| Constant | **10.903** | **10.920** | off by 0.017 |
| R² | **0.100** | **0.107** | off by 0.007 |
| Adj R² | **0.096** | **0.104** | off by 0.008 |
| N | **757** | **787** | off by 30 |

**Likely cause:** different sample restriction / missing-data handling / year filter / variable construction than the paper.

**Fix:** Replicate the paper’s sample definition (e.g., exactly the same survey year subset, exclusion criteria, and missingness rules). Your own diagnostics show `N_year_1993=1606` and `N_complete_music_18=893`, then listwise down to 757—while the paper’s Model 1 is 787. That indicates you’re dropping additional cases the paper kept (or the paper used a different base “complete” definition).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.245 | -0.246 | ~match |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | off by 0.003 |
| Occ prestige | 0.003 | -0.006 | sign mismatch |
| Female | -0.091 | -0.083 | off by 0.008 (and stars differ) |
| Age | 0.127 | 0.140 | off by 0.013 |
| Black | 0.031 | 0.029 | ~match |
| Hispanic | **dropped** | -0.029 | major mismatch |
| Other race | -0.008 | 0.005 | sign mismatch |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.067 | 0.059 | off by 0.008 |
| No religion | -0.004 | -0.012 | off by 0.008 |
| Southern | 0.081 | 0.097 | off by 0.016 (and stars differ) |
| Constant | 8.659 | 8.507 | off by 0.152 |
| R² | 0.136 | 0.151 | off by 0.015 |
| Adj R² | 0.125 | 0.139 | off by 0.014 |
| N | 755 | 756 | off by 1 |

**Likely causes:**
1) **Hispanic incorrectly forced to 0 → dropped** (big).
2) remaining differences suggest **different coding/standardization sample** or **different included cases** (even N differs by 1, and betas shift).

**Fixes:**
- Restore Hispanic variation and include it.
- Ensure standardized betas are computed the same way as the authors (usually: standardize variables on the *model estimation sample*; your note says you do this, but sample differs).
- Verify categorical codings match the paper (e.g., what is the reference group for race? how are “other race” and “black” defined?).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.161 | -0.151 | off by 0.010 |
| Income pc | -0.012 | -0.009 | off by 0.003 |
| Occ prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | off by 0.014 |
| Female | -0.114 | -0.095 | off by 0.019 |
| Age | 0.060 | 0.110 | off by 0.050 (large) |
| Black | 0.062 | 0.049 | off by 0.013 |
| Hispanic | **dropped** | 0.031 | major mismatch |
| Other race | 0.051 | 0.053 | ~match |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.053 | 0.066 | off by 0.013 |
| No religion | 0.020 | 0.024 | off by 0.004 |
| Southern | 0.087 | 0.121 | off by 0.034 (large) |
| Political intolerance | 0.166 | 0.164 | ~match (but stars differ) |
| Constant | 7.355 | 6.516 | off by 0.839 |
| R² | 0.139 | 0.169 | off by 0.030 |
| Adj R² | 0.117 | 0.148 | off by 0.031 |
| N | 426 | 503 | off by 77 |

**Likely causes:**
- Massive N gap: your `political_intolerance` has **402 missing (nonmissing 491)**, but your Model 3 N is **426**, while the paper reports **503**. That implies:
  - Either the paper used **a different intolerance measure** with fewer missings,
  - or you constructed it incorrectly (e.g., requiring too many answered items, coding DK/NA differently, or mistakenly treating valid values as missing),
  - or you restricted the sample beyond the paper (e.g., different year/subsample).

**Fixes:**
- Rebuild the political intolerance scale exactly as the paper:
  - same item set,
  - same rules for missing (e.g., allow partial completion and average/sum across answered items),
  - same handling of “don’t know/refused”.
- Re-check you’re using the same **survey wave/year** and population restrictions as Table 1.
- After fixing the scale, Model 3 N should move toward **503**, and R²/coefficients should shift toward the printed values.

---

## 4) Standard errors: every SE is inherently a mismatch (because the true table has none)

- **True:** “Table 1 … does not print standard errors.”
- **Generated table:** prints a second line under each coefficient (e.g., educ has “-0.316***” then “-0.035” under it), which reads like an SE row—but those values do not correspond to anything in the true table.

**Fix options (choose one consistent with the paper):**
1) **Drop SEs entirely** from the output to match Table 1.  
2) If you want SEs for your own appendix, label clearly as “SE (not in Table 1)” and don’t claim they are from the printed table.

---

## 5) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation mismatch)

Because coefficients (and N) don’t match, stars don’t match either:
- Example: **Political intolerance**: generated `**` (p=.00147) vs true `***`.
- Example: **Southern**: generated `*` in Model 2 vs true `**`.
- Example: **Age**: generated not significant in Model 3 vs true `*`.

**Fix:** Once you replicate the exact sample + variable construction, recompute p-values and apply the paper’s thresholds. But note: if Table 1’s stars come from the authors’ model with standardized betas, you must run the same model to get the same p-values (standardizing doesn’t change p-values if you just rescale predictors, but differences in sample/coding will).

---

## 6) Constants, R², and N mismatches (model fit discrepancies)

All three models show mismatches in:
- **N** (especially Model 1 and Model 3),
- **R² / Adj R²** (all lower in generated),
- **constants** (notably Model 3: 7.355 vs 6.516).

These are downstream consequences of **different estimation samples and/or variable construction**.

**Fix checklist to align fit stats:**
1) Match the paper’s **case selection** exactly (year, age restrictions, any exclusions).
2) Match **missing-data rules** (listwise? pairwise? scale construction allowing partial items?).
3) Match **coding** of categorical variables (race/region/religion).
4) Then compute R²/Adj R² and N; they should align closely.

---

## 7) Summary of required changes to make generated analysis match the true table

1) **Stop fabricating/zero-filling `hispanic`**. Reconstruct it properly and include it in Models 2–3.
2) **Reconstruct `political_intolerance` exactly as in the paper** to reduce missingness and raise Model 3 N to ~503.
3) **Replicate the paper’s analytic sample** so Model 1 N becomes 787 (not 757) and Model 3 N becomes 503 (not 426).
4) **Output only standardized betas** (and stars) to match Table 1; remove SE lines entirely (since Table 1 has none).
5) **Rename variables in output** to match the PDF labels exactly.

If you share the code you used to (a) build `political_intolerance` and (b) subset to the analytic sample, I can point to the exact lines producing the N gaps and the Hispanic drop, and propose precise edits.
