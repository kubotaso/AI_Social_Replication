Below is a line‑by‑line audit of where the **Generated Results** fail to reproduce the **True Results (Table 1)**, grouped into (A) fit statistics / sample sizes, (B) coefficients (standardized betas + stars), (C) variable-name/specification problems, and (D) interpretation/reporting problems. For each mismatch I explain the likely cause and exactly how to fix it so the generated analysis matches the printed table.

---

## A) Fit statistics and N: mismatches

### A1) Sample sizes (N) do not match Table 1
**True N**
- Model 1: **787**
- Model 2: **756**
- Model 3: **503**

**Generated N**
- Model 1: **793**
- Model 2: **401**
- Model 3: **227**

**Why this is a discrepancy**
- The printed table clearly uses much larger N for Models 2 and 3 than your generated models. Your “missingness” tables show huge missingness (e.g., `conserv_prot` missing for 333 cases; `polintol` missing for 402), and the model Ns collapse accordingly—suggesting **you listwise-deleted on variables that were not missing in the authors’ construction**, or you coded key variables in a way that turned many observations into NA.

**How to fix**
1. **Replicate the paper’s analytic sample rules exactly** (often: restrict to valid responses, recode “don’t know/refused” to missing *only* where the paper does).
2. **Reconstruct the same binary indicators** used in the article (race dummies, religion, etc.) from the raw items, ensuring that “not in category” becomes 0 (not NA).
3. Confirm you are not inadvertently turning values into NA during recoding (common error: using `ifelse(condition, 1, NA)` instead of `ifelse(condition, 1, 0)` for dummy variables).
4. If the published table uses **pairwise deletion** or **imputation** (less likely for classic OLS tables, but possible), adopt the same approach. Table 1 Ns are consistent with **listwise deletion on a more complete set of constructed variables**, not with the massive NA rates you produced.

### A2) R² and Adjusted R² do not match Table 1
**True**
- Model 1 R² **0.107**, Adj R² **0.104**
- Model 2 R² **0.151**, Adj R² **0.139**
- Model 3 R² **0.169**, Adj R² **0.148**

**Generated**
- Model 1 R² **0.107613**, Adj R² **0.104220** (this is essentially consistent)
- Model 2 R² **0.176241**, Adj R² **0.157280** (too high)
- Model 3 R² **0.191060**, Adj R² **0.153609** (too high)

**Why**
- Because your Model 2 and 3 samples are much smaller and likely non-random due to coding-induced missingness, the fit statistics change.
- Also, if the dependent variable or predictors are not coded identically to the paper, R² will differ.

**How to fix**
- First fix the **N/sample construction** (A1). Once you match the sample, R² will typically move toward the published values.
- Verify the dependent variable matches exactly: the paper’s DV is **“Number of music genres disliked”**; ensure you constructed it the same way (same genre list, same “dislike” definition, same handling of missing).

## B) Coefficients (standardized) and significance: mismatches

### Critical note about your output format
The **True Results** are **standardized betas** from Table 1. Your `coefficients_long` includes both `coef_raw` and `beta_std`, but your `table1_style_betas` appears to print betas without variable labels, and your p-values are computed from your model (not from the paper’s table). So the comparison must be on **beta_std values and star patterns**.

I’ll compare variable-by-variable using the **standardized betas in your `coefficients_long`**.

---

### B1) Model 1 (SES): standardized betas don’t match exactly

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta_std | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.322*** | **-0.329748*** | differs (more negative) |
| Income pc | -0.037 | -0.033565 | differs (small) |
| Occ prestige | 0.016 | 0.029083 | differs (noticeable) |
| Constant (raw) | 10.920 | 10.833 | differs |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.107 / 0.104 | 0.1076 / 0.1042 | essentially OK |
| N | 787 | 793 | mismatch |

**How to fix**
- Even though fit is close, the N mismatch indicates you are not using the same complete-case definition as the authors.
- Ensure you’re using the *same* weighting (if any). A frequent reason for small coefficient shifts is: **paper uses survey weights**; your output looks unweighted OLS. Check the article methods: if weighted, use weighted regression and compute standardized betas accordingly.

### B2) Model 2 (Demographic): multiple coefficient mismatches + missingness-induced distortions

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta_std | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.310*** | **major** |
| Income pc | -0.054 | -0.031 | moderate |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | +0.040 | **sign flips** |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.079 (p=0.091, no star) | star mismatch |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.134** | star mismatch (*** vs **) |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.061 | differs |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | NaN (coef ~0, beta NaN) | **wrong / missing** |
| Other race | 0.005 | -0.002 | differs (sign) |
| Cons Prot | 0.059 | 0.055 | close |
| No religion | -0.012 | NaN (0 with NaN p) | **wrong / missing** |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.129** | differs |
| Constant | 8.507 | 8.816 | differs |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.151 / 0.139 | 0.176 / 0.157 | too high |
| N | 756 | 401 | **major** |

**What’s going wrong (most likely)**
1. **You are not reproducing the authors’ sample** (N collapses to 401).
2. **`hispanic` and `no_religion` are broken in your model**: you literally have coefficients ~0 and `beta_std = NaN`. That usually happens when:
   - the variable has **zero variance in the analysis sample** (all 0s or all 1s after listwise deletion), or
   - it was coded as all missing then filled with 0 in coef but variance=0 for standardization, or
   - it is collinear / dropped and your extraction mishandled it.
3. The **occupational prestige** sign flip (true -0.006 vs your +0.040) is consistent with either:
   - different sample,
   - different prestige variable (wrong year/scale), or
   - incorrect standardization (e.g., standardizing within the wrong subset).

**How to fix**
- Fix the coding so that `hispanic` and `no_religion` are proper 0/1 indicators with variance in the correct sample.
  - Example fix pattern: define `hispanic = 1 if ethnicity==Hispanic else 0`, **not** NA for non-Hispanic.
  - Same for `no_religion`: 1 if “none”, 0 otherwise.
- Recreate race categories exactly as the paper: “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race”, likely with “White” as reference.
- Ensure your demographic model uses the **same N=756**. Once the sample matches, the betas and stars should move toward the table.

### B3) Model 3 (Political intolerance): key predictor and several others mismatch

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta_std | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.167* | beta differs; star mismatch (** vs *) |
| Income pc | -0.009 | -0.015 | differs small |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | +0.010 | **sign flips** |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.091 (no star) | star mismatch |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.110 (no star; p=0.102) | star mismatch |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.105 | differs |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | NaN | **wrong / missing** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.064 | close-ish |
| Cons Prot | 0.066 | 0.040 | differs |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN | **wrong / missing** |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.142* | star mismatch |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.188** | beta differs; star mismatch |
| Constant | 6.516 | 6.416 | differs |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.169 / 0.148 | 0.191 / 0.154 | too high |
| N | 503 | 227 | **major** |

**What’s going wrong**
- Same core issue: **N is far too small** because your `polintol` has **402 missing (45%)**, which is implausible if the paper reports N=503 in Model 3.
- `hispanic` and `no_religion` again collapse to NaN standardized betas → still broken coding/variance.
- The star mismatches are consistent with using the wrong sample and/or wrong standard errors (weights, robust SEs, etc.). But since the *printed* stars are based on the authors’ p-values, you won’t reproduce them unless you reproduce their estimation approach and sample.

**How to fix**
1. **Reconstruct `polintol` exactly as the paper** (same items, scale, direction, missing handling). Your missingness suggests you may be using the wrong variable name/source or treating valid codes as missing.
2. Confirm whether the paper uses a **scale** (e.g., additive index) vs a single item; if it’s a scale, compute it and only set missing when necessary (e.g., require at least k items).
3. After fixing `polintol`, your Model 3 N should rise to ~503.

## C) Variable name / model specification discrepancies

### C1) Your output includes `exclusiveness` in missingness tables but Table 1 DV is “number of genres disliked”
- In your missingness tables, `exclusiveness` appears as a variable with 0 missing, suggesting it might be the dependent variable in your models.
- The paper’s DV is explicitly **“Number of music genres disliked.”**

**Fix**
- Ensure the regression DV is the correct constructed count of “genres disliked”.
- If the DV in your dataset is named `exclusiveness`, verify it is exactly the same measure as the paper’s DV. If not, rename/replace and rerun.

---

### C2) Mismatch between table output and coefficient list (presentation issue)
- `table1_style_betas` shows rows of betas without variable names and contains `NaN` rows, making it easy to misalign variables vs coefficients.
- The “True Results” table is explicitly aligned variable-by-variable.

**Fix**
- Build the table directly from `coefficients_long` by joining on `term` and mapping to the paper’s variable labels, ensuring ordering matches Table 1:
  1) Education  
  2) Income pc  
  3) Prestige  
  4) Female  
  5) Age  
  6) Black  
  7) Hispanic  
  8) Other race  
  9) Conservative Protestant  
  10) No religion  
  11) Southern  
  12) Political intolerance  

---

## D) Standard errors and interpretation/reporting problems

### D1) Generated results implicitly treat p-values/stars as comparable to Table 1, but Table 1 does not provide SEs and may use different SE assumptions
- The True Results note: **Table 1 prints standardized coefficients only; SEs not printed.**
- Your generated output reports p-values and stars from your own models. Even if you matched betas, your stars may still differ if:
  - the paper used **survey weights** and design-based SEs,
  - the paper used **robust SEs**,
  - the paper used a slightly different sample or coding.

**Fix**
- First match **sample + coding + weights**.  
- Then, if the paper specifies robust or survey SEs, use the same:
  - robust (HC) SEs, or
  - survey package with strata/cluster/weights.
- Only then compare star cutoffs.

## Summary of “every mismatch” that must be corrected

1. **N mismatch in all models** (793 vs 787; 401 vs 756; 227 vs 503).
2. **Model 2 & 3 R²/Adj R² too high** (sample/coding mismatch).
3. **Many standardized betas differ**, including some **sign flips** for occupational prestige (Model 2 and 3).
4. **`hispanic` and `no_religion` are broken** (beta_std NaN; essentially zero coefficient), implying miscoding or zero variance due to listwise deletion.
5. **Political intolerance (`polintol`) missingness is far too large**, collapsing Model 3 sample; likely wrong construction/coding.
6. **Stars/significance patterns do not match** in multiple places (female, age, south, polintol, educ), consistent with wrong sample and/or different SE method.
7. **DV naming/definition uncertainty**: `exclusiveness` appearing suggests DV may not match “genres disliked.”

---

## What to do next (practical path to make your generated analysis match)

1. **Confirm DV**: show the exact code used to compute the dependent variable and verify it matches “number of music genres disliked.”
2. **Show recodes** for: `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conserv_prot`, `no_religion`, `south`, and especially `polintol`.
3. **Verify weights/design** from the paper; rerun with the same estimation approach.
4. **Force table alignment**: print a labeled coefficient table (term → beta) for each model and compare directly to Table 1 ordering.
5. **Recompute standardized betas exactly as the authors** (ideally by standardizing variables on the analysis sample used for each model, then running OLS on standardized variables—this matches “standardized coefficients” most transparently).

If you paste the code (or at least the recoding logic) used to create `polintol`, `hispanic`, and `no_religion`, I can pinpoint precisely why you’re getting NaNs and the N collapse, and specify the exact recode changes needed.
