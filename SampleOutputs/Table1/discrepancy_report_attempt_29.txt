Score: 54/100
============================================================

## A) Mismatches in **variable names / model specification**

### 1) DV labeling mismatch (minor but real)
- **Generated:** “DV: Number of music genres disliked”
- **True:** Same DV, phrased “Number of music genres disliked”
- **Fix:** No substantive change needed—just match the exact printed label/capitalization if you’re reproducing the PDF.

### 2) Predictor naming mismatches (presentation-level, but should be aligned)
These appear to be the same constructs but labeled differently.

| True Table 1 name | Generated term | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Education | `educ` | abbreviation vs printed label | relabel in table output to “Education” |
| Household income per capita | `income_pc` | abbreviation vs printed label | relabel to “Household income per capita” |
| Occupational prestige | `prestg80` | variable coding name vs printed label | relabel to “Occupational prestige” |
| Political intolerance | `political_intolerance` | different naming style | relabel to “Political intolerance” |

No evidence here of *wrong variables*—mostly naming.

## B) Mismatches in **coefficients (standardized betas)**

Below are **every coefficient that differs** between Generated vs True, by model and variable.

### Model 1 (SES): coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332*** | -0.322*** | -0.010 |
| Household income per capita | -0.034 | -0.037 | +0.003 |
| Occupational prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | +0.013 |
| Constant | 11.086 | 10.920 | +0.166 |
| R² | 0.109 | 0.107 | +0.002 |
| Adj. R² | 0.105 | 0.104 | +0.001 |
| N | 758 | 787 | **-29 cases** |

**Fix (substantive):** You are not estimating on the same sample and/or not using the same standardization protocol. The N discrepancy strongly indicates different case inclusion rules (see Section D).

### Model 2 (Demographic): coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.260*** | -0.246*** | -0.014 |
| Household income per capita | -0.051 | -0.054 | +0.003 |
| Occupational prestige | 0.007 | -0.006 | +0.013 |
| Female | -0.090** | -0.083* | -0.007 (and **sig level differs**) |
| Age | 0.129*** | 0.140*** | -0.011 |
| Black | 0.004 | 0.029 | -0.025 |
| Hispanic | 0.034 | -0.029 | **+0.063 (sign flip)** |
| Other race | 0.001 | 0.005 | -0.004 |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.065 | 0.059 | +0.006 |
| No religion | -0.005 | -0.012 | +0.007 |
| Southern | 0.085* | 0.097** | -0.012 (**sig level differs**) |
| Constant | 8.807 | 8.507 | +0.300 |
| R² | 0.145 | 0.151 | -0.006 |
| Adj. R² | 0.133 | 0.139 | -0.006 |
| N | 756 | 756 | match |

**Fix (substantive):** Even with matching N, multiple coefficients (especially **Black** and **Hispanic sign**) indicate you are not reproducing the same coding / reference groups / standardization approach as the PDF table.

Common causes:
- race/ethnicity dummies built differently than the authors (e.g., “Hispanic” possibly mutually exclusive vs not; “Other race” definition differs; handling of multiracial differs)
- different base category (e.g., if “White” is not the omitted group in your dummy set)
- different treatment of missing race/ethnicity (but your missingness table shows none missing—still could be recodes)

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.155** | -0.151** | -0.004 |
| Household income per capita | -0.016 | -0.009 | -0.007 |
| Occupational prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | +0.014 |
| Female | -0.116* | -0.095* | -0.021 |
| Age | 0.060 | 0.110* | **-0.050 (and sig differs)** |
| Black | -0.009 | 0.049 | **-0.058 (sign flip)** |
| Hispanic | 0.086 | 0.031 | +0.055 |
| Other race | 0.052 | 0.053 | -0.001 (close) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.051 | 0.066 | -0.015 |
| No religion | 0.017 | 0.024 | -0.007 |
| Southern | 0.091 | 0.121** | -0.030 (**sig differs**) |
| Political intolerance | 0.173*** | 0.164*** | +0.009 |
| Constant | 7.259 | 6.516 | +0.743 |
| R² | 0.143 | 0.169 | **-0.026** |
| Adj. R² | 0.118 | 0.148 | **-0.030** |
| N | 426 | 503 | **-77 cases** |

**Fix (substantive):** The **N mismatch is huge** and will mechanically change coefficients, SEs, and fit. Your “strict15” intolerance completeness rule (and/or construction of the intolerance scale) is almost certainly not what the original authors used.

---

## C) Mismatches in **standard errors**
This is straightforward:

- **Generated:** The table prints a second line under coefficients that looks like **standard errors** (e.g., under -0.332*** appears “-0.034”, etc.).
- **True:** The PDF Table 1 **does not print standard errors at all** (“standardized coefficients only”).

So in the generated “table1_style”:
- Those second-line numbers **cannot be compared to the PDF** and are presented in a confusing way (they even look like *more coefficients*, not SEs).
- They are also sometimes negative (SEs cannot be negative), which strongly suggests the table formatting routine is misplacing coefficients from other rows or printing something other than SEs.

**Fix:**
1) If your goal is to match the PDF: **remove SE rows entirely** and print only standardized betas with stars.
2) If you want SEs for your own output: compute and print them clearly, but do **not** claim they match Table 1.

---

## D) Mismatches in **sample sizes and case selection** (root cause of many coefficient gaps)

### 1) Model 1 N mismatch
- **Generated N:** 758  
- **True N:** 787  
**Difference:** 29 cases

Your missingness table implies:
- DV nonmissing = 893
- Then you drop to 758 because of missing in `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`.

But the true model keeps 787, meaning **the authors either:**
- had fewer missings after different recodes/imputations/top-coding, or
- used a different year/filter than your “N_year_1993” logic, or
- handled “don’t know/refused” differently (e.g., recoding to median/mean, or using different source variables)

**Fix:** Replicate the authors’ *exact* missing-data handling and inclusion rules. Concretely:
- Verify you are using the **same survey year(s)** and the same subset criteria as the paper.
- Verify all special codes (DK/NA/refused) are recoded exactly as in the original replication instructions (often in appendices).
- Do not listwise-delete unless the paper did.

### 2) Model 3 N mismatch (biggest problem)
- **Generated N:** 426  
- **True N:** 503  
**Difference:** 77 cases

Your diagnostics show:
- `political_intolerance` nonmissing = 491, and then you drop further to 426 after combining with other predictors.

But the true table has N=503, which is **greater than your polintol nonmissing (491)**—this indicates your constructed `political_intolerance` variable is not aligned with the authors’ measure. Likely you are:
- requiring too many items (“strict15” suggests a 15-item complete-case scale), or
- coding missing items as missing rather than using a scale rule (e.g., allow up to k missing and average), or
- using a different item set entirely, or
- filtering to 1993 incorrectly for the intolerance battery.

**Fix:**
- Rebuild `political_intolerance` exactly per the paper: same items, same coding direction, same allowance for partial completion, same scaling (sum vs mean), and same standardization.
- After rebuilding, confirm its nonmissing count is compatible with N=503 once combined with other covariates.

---

## E) Mismatches in **interpretation / reporting**
### 1) Standardized vs unstandardized confusion risk
The true table is **standardized coefficients**. Your long table labels `beta_std`, which is good, but your “table1_style” shows an intercept (constant) alongside standardized betas. Intercepts in “fully standardized” models are often 0; intercepts shown like 10.920 imply the DV is not standardized in the regression that produced the intercept.

**Fix:**
- To match the paper: produce **standardized betas** as they did (typically standardize X’s, keep Y in original units—common in sociology tables), which yields nonzero intercepts.
- Ensure your standardization method matches:  
  - either standardize each predictor (z-score) and regress raw DV; or  
  - use software’s “beta” conversion.  
Different approaches can shift values slightly.

### 2) Significance stars mismatches
Example: Female in Model 2 is **-0.090\*\*** generated but **-0.083\*** true. Southern in Model 2 is * vs **.

Because the true SEs are not available, we can’t compare SEs—but the star differences imply **different p-values**, caused by:
- different N (not in Model 2), or
- different coefficient/SE due to coding differences, weighting, clustering, or robust SE choices.

**Fix:**
- Match the authors’ inference method: OLS with (likely) survey weights? robust SEs? clustered? If the paper used design-based SEs, your plain OLS p-values will differ.
- Apply identical weighting/design corrections if applicable.

---

## Summary of what to change so the generated analysis matches the “True Results”
1) **Stop printing SE rows** in Table 1 output (the PDF doesn’t include them). Also fix the formatting bug where “SEs” appear negative/misaligned.
2) **Replicate the exact analytic samples** (N=787, 756, 503). Your Model 1 and Model 3 samples are wrong.
3) **Reconstruct/correct coding of race/ethnicity and political intolerance**, because you have multiple sign flips (Hispanic in Model 2; Black in Model 3) and big N loss for intolerance.
4) **Match the authors’ standardization and inference approach** (how betas were computed; whether weights/design-based SEs were used), to resolve remaining coefficient and star discrepancies.

If you share the code used to construct (a) race variables and (b) the political intolerance scale, I can pinpoint exactly where the sign flips and N losses are introduced and specify the exact recode changes.
