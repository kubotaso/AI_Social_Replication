Score: 34/100
============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics (n, R², adj. R²): mismatches

### Model 1 (SES)
- **n**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - Fix: you’re dropping ~40 extra cases. Ensure your model uses the same inclusion rules as the paper (same GSS year, same age restrictions if any, same treatment of DK/NA, and—crucially—same missing-data handling). If you did listwise deletion on variables not in Model 1 (e.g., pol_intol), that would incorrectly reduce n.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.088 / 0.085**
  - True: **0.107 / 0.104**
  - Fix: once the sample and variable coding match, R² should move. Also confirm you are using **OLS with the same dependent variable construction** (“number of genres disliked”) and not a recode/variant.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **n**
  - Generated: **745**
  - True: **756**
  - Fix: again, too many cases dropped. Check you didn’t inadvertently require nonmissingness on variables not in Model 2.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.127 / 0.114**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - Fix: will follow from correct n + correct coding of race, religion, region, and the standardized-coefficient reporting (see below).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **n**
  - Generated: **491**
  - True: **503**
  - Fix: you’re losing 12 extra cases beyond what the paper loses when adding political intolerance. Likely differences in how **pol_intol** is constructed (range, handling DK/NA, whether “don’t know” recoded to missing, etc.).

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.144 / 0.122**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - Fix: sample alignment + correct pol_intol scaling/coding.

---

## 2) Variable names / labeling: mismatches

- Generated uses **“Political intolerance (0–15)”** but missingness table lists the variable as **pol_intol** and doesn’t confirm the **0–15** construction matches the paper.
  - Fix: explicitly document and reproduce the paper’s index construction (items included, coding direction, sum vs mean, range). Then label consistently.

- Generated outcome labeled nowhere in models, but missingness references **num_genres_disliked** which is consistent with the paper’s DV (“Number of Music Genres Disliked”).  
  - Fix: verify your DV is built from the same set of genres and the same “dislike” definition and missing-data rules as the paper.

---

## 3) Coefficients: generated vs true (Table 1 uses standardized β)

### Critical reporting error: you mix b and β
- The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except constants).
- Your `model*_full` tables include both **b** and **beta**, but your “Table1style” output appears to (correctly) use **beta**—however you **mismatch values** for some terms (see below), and some signs/significance differ.

**Fix:** build the final table exclusively from standardized coefficients for predictors and unstandardized intercepts, matching the paper:
- In R: `lm.beta::lm.beta(lm(...))` or compute `scale()` for x and y and refit; or use `parameters::model_parameters(..., standardize="refit")`.
- Do **not** report standard errors if the paper doesn’t; if you show SEs, label them as your own estimates and don’t claim they match Table 1.

---

## 4) Term-by-term mismatches (β, signs, and stars)

Below I compare your **Table1style β** to the **True β** (since that’s what Table 1 reports).

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.292***  
  - True β: **-0.322***  
  - Fix: sample/coding mismatch (education or DV), and/or standardization method differs. Use the same sample (n=787) and same coding.

- **Income per capita**
  - Generated β: **-0.039**
  - True β: **-0.037**
  - Small mismatch; likely sample/coding.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **0.020**
  - True β: **0.016**
  - Small mismatch.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.638**
  - True: **10.920**
  - Fix: intercept depends on coding and sample. Align sample and variable coding.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.228***  
  - True β: **-0.246***  
  - Fix: sample/coding/standardization alignment.

- **Income per capita**
  - Generated β: **-0.055**
  - True β: **-0.054**
  - Close.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **0.005**
  - True β: **-0.006**
  - **Sign mismatch.**
  - Fix: likely coding mismatch in prestige variable (direction) or a different prestige measure. Confirm you used the same prestige scale/year-specific variable and that higher values mean higher prestige (as in the paper).

- **Female**
  - Generated β: **-0.084***? (you show `-0.084*` in Table1style; in full model p=.016)  
  - True β: **-0.083***? (true shows -0.083* only)  
  - Coefficient matches closely; star level should be * (p<.05), which your p=.016 supports.  
  - Fix: ensure you don’t accidentally add extra stars in the table formatter.

- **Age**
  - Generated β: **0.128***  
  - True β: **0.140***  
  - Fix: sample/coding.

- **Black**
  - Generated β: **0.037**
  - True β: **0.029**
  - Close.

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated β: **0.060**
  - True β: **-0.029**
  - **Sign mismatch and large difference.**
  - Fix: this almost certainly indicates a **different reference category or coding error** in race/ethnicity:
    - The paper has three dummies (Black, Hispanic, Other race) likely with **White as reference**.
    - Verify your Hispanic dummy: 1=Hispanic, 0=non-Hispanic (including Whites and Blacks), and that race dummies are mutually exclusive as intended in the paper. Also verify that “Hispanic” isn’t being double-counted with “Black” etc.

- **Other race**
  - Generated β: **-0.017**
  - True β: **0.005**
  - Sign mismatch (small).
  - Fix: same race-coding issue.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated β: **0.100** **(and significant)**  
  - True β: **0.059** **(not significant / no stars shown)**  
  - Fix: your religious tradition variable is not matching the paper’s definition. “Conservative Protestant” in GSS typically requires a **RELTRAD**-style classification (Steensland et al.) rather than a simple PROT + fundamentalist, etc. If you used a different operationalization, you will not match.

- **No religion**
  - Generated β: **0.002**
  - True β: **-0.012**
  - Fix: “no religion” coding mismatch (which GSS variable? `relig` vs `relig16`/`other`?), and/or reference category for religion differs.

- **Southern**
  - Generated β: **0.068** (no stars; p≈.058 in full model)
  - True β: **0.097** **(significant, **)**  
  - Fix: region coding and/or sample mismatch; also could be weighting differences.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **8.065**
  - True: **8.507**
  - Fix: sample/coding.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.124***? (you show `-0.124*`)
  - True β: **-0.151** **(should be ** per true table)**  
  - Fix: align sample and standardization; also your star level differs (true says **, yours says *).

- **Income per capita**
  - Generated β: **-0.036**
  - True β: **-0.009**
  - **Large mismatch.**
  - Fix: income-per-capita construction differs (equivalization, top-coding, inflation adjustment, or missing-data handling). The paper’s “per capita” may be constructed differently than your `inc_pc`.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **0.008**
  - True β: **-0.022**
  - **Sign mismatch.**
  - Fix: same prestige-measure issue as Model 2, possibly exacerbated by sample change.

- **Female**
  - Generated β: **-0.098***
  - True β: **-0.095***
  - Close.

- **Age**
  - Generated β: **0.087** (p≈.0567, no star in your Table1style)
  - True β: **0.110*** (true shows 0.110*).
  - Fix: sample/coding; also your p-value is borderline—paper’s model likely yields p<.05 with their sample/weights/coding.

- **Black / Hispanic / Other race**
  - Generated: **0.067 / 0.067 / 0.053**
  - True: **0.049 / 0.031 / 0.053**
  - Hispanic notably off again → race coding still inconsistent.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated β: **0.104*** (significant)
  - True β: **0.066** (no stars)
  - Fix: same RELTRAD / definition mismatch.

- **No religion**
  - Generated β: **0.037**
  - True β: **0.024**
  - Close.

- **Southern**
  - Generated β: **0.074** (not significant)
  - True β: **0.121** **(significant, **)**  
  - Fix: region coding/weights/sample.

- **Political intolerance**
  - Generated β: **0.191***  
  - True β: **0.164***  
  - Fix: your pol_intol scale or items differ, or standardization differs, or sample differs (n 491 vs 503).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **5.857**
  - True: **6.516**
  - Fix: sample/coding.

---

## 5) Standard errors: mismatch in principle
- The **true Table 1 does not report SEs**, but your generated outputs imply inferential tests from SEs/p-values.
- Fix: if your goal is to “match Table 1,” remove SE columns from the comparison output, and generate stars using the paper’s thresholds **on your p-values** only as a convenience—but be clear they won’t match unless the model setup matches exactly.

---

## 6) Interpretation errors (implied by your output formatting)
- Your “Table1style” displays **standardized betas** but labels them like raw coefficients (e.g., Education (years) shown as -0.292*** even though that’s β). In the full tables you have both `b` and `beta`, so it’s easy to accidentally interpret β as “years”.
- Fix: label columns explicitly:
  - `β (standardized)` for predictors
  - `b0 (constant, unstandardized)` for intercept
  - and don’t attach units (e.g., “years”) to β interpretations.

---

## 7) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the paper

1) **Match the analytic sample per model**
   - For Model 1, do **not** drop cases because of demographics or political intolerance missingness.
   - For Model 2, do **not** drop cases because of political intolerance.
   - Use model-specific listwise deletion: `lm(..., na.action = na.omit)` on *only variables in that model*.

2) **Recreate the paper’s variable constructions**
   - DV: same genres, same “dislike” coding, same handling of DK/NA.
   - `inc_pc`: replicate the paper’s “per capita” exactly (household income / household size? equivalence scale?).
   - `prestige`: confirm the exact GSS prestige variable used and direction.
   - Race/ethnicity: ensure mutually exclusive dummies with **White** as reference, and ensure Hispanic isn’t miscoded.
   - Conservative Protestant: use a **RELTRAD-style** classification if that’s what the paper used.

3) **Use standardized coefficients for predictors**
   - Refit standardized model or compute β correctly.
   - Ensure you’re extracting the same β definition used in the paper (typically SD change in y per SD change in x).

4) **Check weights**
   - Many GSS analyses use weights. If the paper used weights and you did not (or vice versa), n stays the same but coefficients/R² can shift.
   - Fix: apply the correct weight variable (and note that standard `lm()` handles weights but not complex survey SEs).

5) **Rebuild the Table 1 output**
   - Predictors: β only (rounded to 3 decimals like the paper).
   - Intercept: unstandardized constant.
   - R², adj. R², n: match per model.

If you share your code (or at least the exact GSS variable names used for DV, income, prestige, race, religion, south, and pol_intol), I can pinpoint which specific construction (e.g., RELTRAD vs simple denomination, Hispanic coding, income equivalization) is driving each sign flip.
