Score: 33/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: **all three models mismatch (R², adj. R², and N)**

**Model 1 (SES)**
- **Generated:** n=747, R²=0.088, adj R²=0.085  
- **True:** n=787, R²=0.107, adj R²=0.104  
**Fix:** You are not using the same estimation sample as the paper. To match the table, you must reproduce the paper’s listwise-deletion rule *for exactly the variables included in Model 1* and the same weighting/filters (e.g., valid skips, “don’t know,” “refused,” any age restrictions). Your missingness table suggests much larger overall N (1606), so the drop to 747 implies additional filtering/coding differences beyond simple missingness in SES vars.

**Model 2 (Demographic)**
- **Generated:** n=507, R²=0.138, adj R²=0.119  
- **True:** n=756, R²=0.151, adj R²=0.139  
**Fix:** Same issue but worse: your sample is far smaller than the paper’s. This typically happens when:
1) you accidentally require nonmissing on variables that aren’t in the model (e.g., `pol_intol`), or  
2) you coded race/region/religion in a way that creates missingness (e.g., treating inapplicables as NA), or  
3) you used a different year/subsample than “GSS 1993”.

**Model 3 (Political intolerance)**
- **Generated:** n=286, R²=0.150, adj R²=0.113  
- **True:** n=503, R²=0.169, adj R²=0.148  
**Fix:** Your `pol_intol` has ~47% missingness; the paper’s Model 3 clearly has **503 cases**, so their political intolerance measure (or its handling) yields many more usable observations than yours. You likely:
- built `pol_intol` from items but treated “don’t know”/“depends” as missing instead of recoding, or
- used a stricter rule (e.g., requiring all component items rather than allowing partial scoring), or
- used the wrong variable entirely.

### 2) Coefficients: **you’re mixing unstandardized b’s with a table of standardized β’s**

The “True Results” explicitly say Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except the constant). Your generated tables report **both**:
- `b` (unstandardized slope) and
- `beta` (standardized coefficient)

This creates two problems:

1) **Your narrative/“generated results” appear to treat b as the paper’s coefficient** in places, but the paper’s reported numbers are **β**, not b.  
2) Even when comparing your `beta` to the paper’s β, several don’t match (see below), which again indicates sample/coding differences.

**Fix:** If you want to “match the paper,” you should report **only standardized β (and stars)** and constants unstandardized—*and do not report SEs if the paper doesn’t*. Or, if you keep SEs for your own output, clearly label that they are from your replication and are not in the paper.

---

### 3) Variable-by-variable mismatches (β, sign, and significance)

Below I compare **Generated `beta`** to **True β** (because that’s what the paper reports).

#### Model 1 (SES)

- **Education**
  - Generated β = **-0.292*** vs True β = **-0.322*** → mismatch (magnitude)
  - **Fix:** sample/coding mismatch (education coding, range restriction, or weights). Ensure education is coded exactly as “years,” and exclude the same invalid codes.

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated β = **-0.039** vs True β = **-0.037** → essentially matches
  - But your **p=.31 (ns)** aligns with the paper having no stars.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β = **0.020** vs True β = **0.016** → close

- **Constant**
  - Generated constant = **10.638** vs True constant = **10.920** → mismatch
  - **Fix:** intercept changes with sample and with any centering/standardization approach. If you standardized predictors before fitting, that will alter the constant. The paper’s constant is from an unstandardized model with unstandardized predictors.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

Key mismatches:

- **Age**
  - Generated β = **0.104***? (p=.019, one star) vs True β = **0.140***  
  - **Fix:** age coding (years vs categories), inclusion of different cases, or different handling of top-coding/age restrictions. Also: paper finds ***; you find only *.

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated β = **+0.036** vs True β = **-0.029** → **sign reversal**
  - **Fix:** this is a classic dummy-coding/reference-category problem or a variable-definition mismatch:
    - You might have coded `hispanic` as “non-Hispanic” (1=not Hispanic) by mistake, or
    - You used a three-category race/ethnicity scheme and then also included race dummies, creating collinearity/interpretation shifts, or
    - You included Hispanics inside “Other race” or “Black” inconsistently.
  - To fix: replicate the paper’s coding exactly (mutually exclusive race categories and a separate Hispanic dummy if that’s what they did—or not). Ensure the reference group matches (typically White, non-Hispanic).

- **Other race**
  - Generated β = **-0.027** vs True β = **+0.005** → sign mismatch
  - **Fix:** same race-coding issue as above.

- **Southern**
  - Generated β = **0.063 (ns)** vs True β = **0.097** **(significant, **)**
  - **Fix:** region coding mismatch (e.g., using “born in South” vs “lives in South,” or different South definition), plus your reduced N kills significance.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated β = **0.081 (p=.08)** vs True β = **0.059 (ns)**  
  - **Fix:** denomination coding mismatch. “Conservative Protestant” is often built from detailed religion + denomination variables; if you used a rough proxy, effects and N will shift.

- **Constant**
  - Generated constant = **9.645** vs True = **8.507** → mismatch
  - **Fix:** again indicates different sample and/or you may have centered/standardized differently when fitting.

Some that are *close enough*:
- **Education:** Generated β=-0.265*** vs True -0.246*** (still a mismatch but same direction and significance)
- **Income:** Generated β=-0.056 vs True -0.054 (close)
- **Female:** Generated β=-0.087* vs True -0.083* (close)
- **Black:** Generated β=0.013 vs True 0.029 (diff but both ns)

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

- **Political intolerance**
  - Generated β = **0.183** (p=.0039, ** ) vs True β = **0.164***  
  - **Mismatch in significance level** (you get **, paper gets ***)
  - **Fix:** larger N in the paper (503 vs your 286) will increase power; also your intolerance measure construction likely differs.

- **Age**
  - Generated β = **0.092 (ns)** vs True β = **0.110* (sig)**
  - **Fix:** again N loss and/or age coding.

- **Southern**
  - Generated β = **0.073 (ns)** vs True β = **0.121** **(sig)**
  - **Fix:** region coding + N loss.

- **Income**
  - Generated β = **-0.058** vs True β = **-0.009** → big magnitude mismatch
  - **Fix:** this suggests your **income per capita** variable is not constructed the same way (or you used raw income per capita but paper used logged income per capita, or a different equivalence scale, or winsorized/capped extremes). Rebuild `inc_pc` exactly as the paper.

- **Constant**
  - Generated = **7.590** vs True = **6.516** → mismatch (sample/coding/standardization differences).

---

### 4) Standard errors: **not comparable / shouldn’t be presented as “matching”**

- **Generated output includes SE implicitly (via p-values)**, but the “True Results” explicitly: **SE not reported**.
- So any claim of matching SEs is impossible from the paper table alone.

**Fix:** Remove SE/p-values from the “match-to-paper” comparison and instead compare:
- standardized β
- significance stars (at the same thresholds)
- R²/adj R²
- N  
If you keep p-values, frame them as “replication inference,” not as discrepancies with the table.

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by the output structure

Two interpretive traps:

1) **Interpreting `b` as the paper’s reported coefficient.**  
   The paper reports **β**, so interpretations should be in SD units (“a 1 SD increase in education predicts X SD change in disliked genres”), not “per year of education predicts b units”.

2) **Interpreting “Political intolerance (0–15)” as identical to the paper’s measure.**  
   Your missingness (47% missing) and N (286) strongly suggests it’s not constructed/handled the same way; any substantive interpretation will diverge.

**Fix:** Align measurement first, then interpret.

---

### 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true table

1) **Use the same sample restrictions as the paper (GSS 1993)**
   - Filter to 1993 only (and the same subsample if applicable).
   - Apply the same eligibility criteria (e.g., respondents asked the music genre questions).

2) **Recreate variables exactly**
   - **Outcome:** `num_genres_disliked` must match the paper’s definition (which genres included, how “dislike” defined, how “don’t know” treated).
   - **Income per capita:** match equivalence scale, any transformations (log?), and handling of zero/negative/missing.
   - **Conservative Protestant / No religion:** use the same denominational classification scheme.
   - **Race/ethnicity:** ensure dummy variables correspond to the same categories and reference group used in the paper; fix Hispanic sign reversals by verifying coding.

3) **Listwise deletion by model (not globally)**
   - Model 1 should drop only cases missing on: outcome + educ + inc_pc + prestige.
   - Model 2 should drop only on variables in Model 2.
   - Model 3 should drop only on variables in Model 3.
   - Do **not** pre-drop on `pol_intol` when estimating Models 1–2.

4) **Compute standardized coefficients in the same way**
   - Standardize variables in the analytic sample for each model (or use a function that returns standardized β from an unstandardized fit).
   - Do not standardize the dependent variable if the paper’s β are standard “y and x standardized” betas—typically both are standardized, but implementations differ; choose the convention matching the paper (most regression β standardize both y and x; check).

5) **Match reporting**
   - Report: β with stars, constant (unstandardized), R², adj R², N.
   - Omit SEs/p-values in the “matching table” section (or segregate them).

If you want, paste (a) your variable construction code for `inc_pc`, race/Hispanic, and `pol_intol`, and (b) the exact model-fitting code (including any `na.omit` / filtering), and I can point to the precise line(s) causing each N drop and each sign reversal.
