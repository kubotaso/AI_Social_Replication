============================================================

## A. Structural/sample-size mismatches (biggest discrepancies)

### 1) Models 2 and 3 are missing entirely in the generated output
- **Generated:** Model 2 and Model 3 have **N = 0**, R²/Adj R² = NaN, every coefficient is `—/NaN`, and the estimation samples `m2` and `m3` are **empty data frames**.
- **True:** Model 2 has **N = 756** and Model 3 has **N = 503**, with many nonzero coefficients.

**How to fix**
- Your data prep is dropping all rows for Model 2/3. The most common causes:
  1) **An overly strict complete-case filter** across *all* variables (including ones not in that model), or
  2) **All values are missing** for one or more added predictors due to bad recodes/merges (e.g., `female`, `black`, religion dummies, `political_intolerance`), causing `dropna()` to eliminate everything.
- Implement model-specific complete-case filtering:
  - For Model 2: drop missing only on `{y, educ, income_pc, prestg80, female, age, black, hispanic, other_race, conservative_protestant, no_religion, southern}`
  - For Model 3: drop missing only on Model 2 vars + `{political_intolerance}`
- Verify recodes produce non-missing values:
  - Print missingness counts by variable **before** filtering.
  - Confirm dummies are 0/1 and not all NaN; confirm `political_intolerance` is numeric and within expected range.

### 2) N (sample size) mismatch even in Model 1
- **Generated:** Model 1 N = **758**
- **True:** Model 1 N = **787**

**How to fix**
- You are excluding ~29 extra cases relative to the paper. Likely causes:
  - You required non-missing on variables the paper didn’t require (e.g., accidentally requiring `music_18` complete items, year restriction logic, or other fields).
  - Different construction of `income_pc` (e.g., requiring household size, or merging income and size in a way that loses cases).
- Align the exact inclusion rule to the table: only require non-missing on DV + the three SES predictors for Model 1.

## B. Variable-name mismatches (and labeling issues)

### 3) Dependent variable labeling mismatch (and likely construction mismatch risk)
- **True DV name/meaning:** “**Number of music genres disliked**”
- **Generated DV column:** `num_genres_disliked` (that’s fine as an internal name), but your output table doesn’t print the DV or constant properly and you label models “SES/Demographic/Political intolerance” without confirming DV.

**How to fix**
- In the table, explicitly label DV and include the constant (see Section D).
- Ensure your DV is constructed identically (count of disliked genres) and uses the same set of genres and coding as the source table.

### 4) Predictor labels differ from the table wording (minor, but should match)
- **True labels:** Education; Household income per capita; Occupational prestige; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern; Political intolerance.
- **Generated variable names:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`.

These are fine internally, but your printed table should map them to the paper’s wording.

**How to fix**
- Add a label map when printing (e.g., `educ -> Education`, `income_pc -> Household income per capita`, etc.).

---

## C. Coefficient mismatches (Model 1) — all differences

The paper reports **standardized coefficients**. Your “coefficients_long.beta” appears to be standardized (or close), but it does **not match** exactly.

### 5) Education coefficient mismatch (Model 1)
- **Generated:** `educ` = **-0.332*** (beta = -0.331721)
- **True:** Education = **-0.322***  
- **Mismatch:** -0.010 (generated is more negative)

**How to fix**
- Ensure you are computing the *same* standardized coefficient definition as the paper.
  - Many papers standardize *all variables* (including DV) prior to OLS.
  - Others report “beta” by scaling unstandardized b with SDx/SDy.
- Replicate the paper’s approach explicitly:
  - If using z-scoring, z-score **DV and all predictors** on the estimation sample of each model, then run OLS (no robust SE).
  - Confirm you are using the same weighting (likely none), same handling of missingness, and same year/subsample restriction.

### 6) Income per capita coefficient mismatch (Model 1)
- **Generated:** `income_pc` = **-0.034**
- **True:** Household income per capita = **-0.037**
- **Mismatch:** +0.003 (generated is less negative)

**How to fix**
- Same as above (standardization + sample alignment).
- Additionally: confirm `income_pc` is computed the same way as the authors (e.g., income / household size, handling of top-codes, inflation adjustments, equivalence scales). A different construction will shift the standardized slope.

### 7) Occupational prestige coefficient mismatch (Model 1)
- **Generated:** `prestg80` = **0.029**
- **True:** Occupational prestige = **0.016**
- **Mismatch:** +0.013 (generated is more positive)

**How to fix**
- This gap is large enough to suspect either:
  - different prestige measure (wrong scale/variable/year), or
  - different sample (your N is already off), or
  - different standardization method.
- Verify `prestg80` is the exact prestige variable used in the paper and that it’s coded correctly (no reverse coding, no mistaken imputation, no rescaling).

## D. Standard errors and significance interpretation mismatches

### 8) You printed “standard errors” that the true table does not provide
- **True:** The PDF table reports **standardized coefficients only** and **does not print SEs**.
- **Generated:** table shows a second line under each coefficient that looks like an SE (e.g., `-0.034` followed by `0.029` etc.), but these values do not correspond to the paper (because the paper doesn’t report them).

**How to fix**
- Remove the SE row entirely to match the printed table; OR
- If you want SEs, compute them from your model output, but then you must **not** claim they come from Table 1 and you should state they are **computed**, not extracted.

### 9) Significance stars do not align with the paper’s stars (Model 1 income, prestige)
- **True:** Income = -0.037 (no stars), Prestige = 0.016 (no stars), Education has ***.
- **Generated:** Education has ***, Income has none (OK), Prestige has none (OK).
- But because your betas differ, your p-values may differ; also your output shows p-values (e.g., income p=0.365; prestige p=0.476) that cannot be validated against the paper’s table.

**How to fix**
- To match the paper, use the paper’s coefficients and stars (or reproduce them by matching sample + method).
- Don’t mix “extracted-from-table” results with “model-estimated p-values” unless you explicitly separate them.

### 10) Interpretation mismatch: you implicitly treat the coefficients as if they’re from your estimation, not as “as printed”
- **True table:** standardized betas “as printed”; no SE; stars correspond to authors’ tests.
- **Generated output:** includes p-values and asterisks derived from your model.

**How to fix**
- Decide which goal you have:
  1) **Reproduce the printed table:** report only standardized betas and the exact stars, omit SE/p-values, match N/R²/Adj R² exactly.
  2) **Re-estimate models from microdata:** then report betas/SE/p-values from your estimation and do not claim they equal the PDF unless they match within tolerance; explain any deviations.

## E. Fit statistics mismatches

### 11) R²/Adj R² mismatch (Model 1)
- **Generated:** R² = **0.10877**, Adj R² = **0.105224**
- **True:** R² = **0.107**, Adj R² = **0.104**
- **Mismatch:** small but real (and consistent with N mismatch + coefficient differences)

**How to fix**
- Align sample (N=787) and variable construction/standardization; then R² should move toward the printed values.

### 12) R²/Adj R² missing for Models 2 and 3
- **Generated:** NaN (because N=0)
- **True:** Model 2 R²=0.151 Adj=0.139; Model 3 R²=0.169 Adj=0.148

**How to fix**
- Fix the empty-sample issue (Section A).

---

## F. Missing rows in the generated table (constant, R², N formatting)

### 13) Constant is missing / not printed correctly
- **True:** Constants are 10.920; 8.507; 6.516
- **Generated:** no constant row appears; table ends with “0.109 / 0.105 / 758 0 0” which looks like fit stats jammed into the coefficient area.

**How to fix**
- Fix table-building code so:
  - “Constant” is a row with the intercept value
  - R², Adj R², N are separate fit-stat lines/blocks, not inserted as coefficients.

---

## Summary of what you must change to match the “True Results”

1) **Fix data filtering** so Model 2 has N=756 and Model 3 has N=503 (model-specific complete cases; verify recodes).
2) **Match Model 1 sample** so N=787 (don’t over-drop cases).
3) **Ensure standardized coefficients are computed the same way** (z-score approach and sample-specific standardization are the usual culprit).
4) **Use the same variable constructions** (especially `income_pc`, `prestg80`, and `political_intolerance`).
5) **Remove SEs/p-values from the “as printed” reproduction** (or clearly label them as your own estimates).
6) **Repair table formatting**: include constant and proper fit-stat rows, and map variable names to the table’s labels.

If you paste your code for (a) variable construction, (b) missing-data filtering, and (c) how you compute “standardized betas,” I can point to the exact lines that are causing N=0 for Models 2/3 and the beta drift in Model 1.
