============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True Results (Table 1)**, covering **variable names/inclusion, coefficients, (improper) standard errors, fit stats, N, and interpretation/significance**—and exactly what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the printed table.

---

## 1) Variables included / variable-name mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is missing in the generated models (major mismatch)**
- **True Results:** Hispanic appears in Model 2 and Model 3 with coefficients:
  - Model 2: **Hispanic = -0.029**
  - Model 3: **Hispanic = 0.031**
- **Generated Results:** `hispanic_available_in_file = False` and `hispanic` is shown as `included=False` in all models.

**How to fix**
1. Ensure the dataset you’re using actually contains the Hispanic indicator used in the paper (may be named differently, e.g., `hispan`, `hispanic`, `ethnic`, `latino`, or a multi-category race/ethnicity variable that must be recoded).
2. Recreate the paper’s coding:
   - If the paper uses mutually exclusive race/ethnicity dummies (White omitted), you likely need **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race** indicators constructed from a single race/ethnicity variable.
3. Re-run Model 2 and Model 3 with Hispanic included.

> Until Hispanic is present and coded the same way, you cannot match the published coefficients for race or the overall fit/N.

### B. **Model 2 table display shows a “—” row that shouldn’t be there**
In `table1_style` under Model 2, there is a line:
- `—    —    —`
This looks like a placeholder for a variable (likely “Hispanic”) but it’s blank.

**How to fix**
- Once `hispanic` is correctly added, that row should become Hispanic’s coefficient (and align with Table 1 ordering).

### C. Potential naming mismatch: `income_pc`
- True Results label: “Household income per capita”
- Generated term: `income_pc`
This is fine **if** it’s constructed identically (same year dollars, equivalization, top-coding, scaling). But given coefficient mismatches (below), construction/scaling may be off.

**How to fix**
- Verify the exact transformation used in the paper for “household income per capita” (household income ÷ household size? adults? logged?).
- Confirm whether the paper standardized *after* computing per-capita income (it likely did).

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

The True Results table reports **standardized coefficients**. Your `coefficients_long` includes `beta_std`, which is what should match—yet it does not.

### Model 1 (SES): standardized coefficients don’t match
| Variable | True | Generated `beta_std` | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | **-0.331721** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.037 | **-0.033879** | off |
| Prestige | 0.016 | **0.029360** | too positive |

**How to fix**
- The most common reasons standardized betas differ from a published table:
  1. **Different sample used** (your N differs—see Section 4).
  2. **Different coding/cleaning** of variables (income construction, prestige scale, etc.).
  3. **Standardization method differs** (e.g., standardizing using full sample vs model listwise sample; or using weighted SDs vs unweighted SDs).

To match Table 1, you must:
- Use the **same estimation sample N as the paper** for each model (see Section 4).
- Standardize predictors and DV **exactly as the authors did**:
  - Most likely: z-score variables **within the model estimation sample** (listwise) and run OLS, or compute standardized betas from raw OLS using sample SDs from the same estimation sample.
  - If the paper uses survey weights, standardization might be weighted.

### Model 2 (Demographic): multiple coefficient mismatches
Key differences:

| Variable | True | Generated `beta_std` |
|---|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.258902 |
| Income pc | -0.054 | -0.050131 |
| Prestige | -0.006 | **0.006332** (sign flip) |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.089375 |
| Age | 0.140*** | **0.128883** |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.029598 (close) |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.001379 |
| Cons Prot | 0.059 | 0.066592 |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.004236 |
| Southern | 0.097** | **0.083709** |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **missing** |

**How to fix**
- **Prestige sign flip** is a strong warning that you are not reproducing the same:
  - prestige variable (e.g., `prestg80` vs another prestige measure),
  - coding (reverse coding),
  - or sample/weights/standardization.
- Add **Hispanic** (Section 1A).
- Align sample and standardization method.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): many mismatches + wrong significance for political intolerance
| Variable | True | Generated `beta_std` | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.160579 | off |
| Income pc | -0.009 | -0.012314 | off |
| Prestige | -0.022 | **-0.007835** | off |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.114208 | off |
| Age | 0.110* | **0.060288** | much smaller |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.061988 | off |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | missing | missing |
| Southern | 0.121** | **0.086865** | too small |
| Political intolerance | **0.164*** | **0.166456** | close magnitude, **wrong stars** in generated |

**How to fix**
- Correct Model 3 **sample size** (you have 426; paper has 503), which will affect coefficients and especially p-values/stars.
- Ensure **political intolerance** is measured on the same scale and constructed identically (index composition, missingness handling).
- Add Hispanic; align standardization + weights.

## 3) Standard errors: generated output prints SEs that the “true” table does not contain

### A. Generated table prints numbers that look like SEs
In `table1_style`, each coefficient line is followed by a second line (e.g., for educ in Model 1: `-0.332***` then `-0.034`). That implies you are printing **standard errors**, but:

- **True Results:** explicitly states **Table 1 does not print standard errors**.

**How to fix**
- If your goal is to “match Table 1,” **remove SE rows entirely** from the presentation.
- Or, if you want to keep SEs for your own appendix, label them clearly and do not claim they are from Table 1.

### B. If you insist on matching significance stars, SE/p-values must be based on the same design
Even if Table 1 omits SEs, it includes stars. Your stars will only match if:
- same sample (N),
- same weighting,
- same model specification,
- same missingness rules,
- and same variance estimator (plain OLS vs robust vs clustered vs survey).

---

## 4) Fit statistics and N mismatches (biggest reproducibility failure)

### A. N differs in Model 1 and Model 3
- **True N**
  - Model 1: **787**
  - Model 2: **756**
  - Model 3: **503**
- **Generated N**
  - Model 1: **758** (29 fewer)
  - Model 2: **756** (matches)
  - Model 3: **426** (77 fewer)

**How to fix**
1. Replicate the paper’s **missing-data handling**:
   - Your diagnostics show `political_intolerance` nonmissing = 491, yet Model 3 N=426. That suggests **additional items/strict completeness rules** are being imposed (`polintol_strict_complete_case_items = 15`), likely creating extra listwise deletion not used by the authors.
2. For Model 1: your listwise N=758 suggests you are dropping cases for income/education/prestige more aggressively than the authors did (or your variables differ).
3. Confirm whether the authors:
   - used **imputation**,
   - used **pairwise present** for scale construction,
   - or used different item-availability rules for indexes.

### B. R² / Adjusted R² do not match
- **True R²:** (0.107, 0.151, 0.169)
- **Generated R²:** (0.10877, 0.14520, 0.13940)

Model 3 is especially far off (0.139 vs 0.169), consistent with the wrong N and/or different political intolerance construction.

**How to fix**
- Once you match the paper’s sample and variable construction, R² should move into alignment.
- Also confirm whether the paper used **weighted R²** (many survey analyses do). Unweighted vs weighted can shift R² and coefficients.

### C. Constants do not match
- True constants: 10.920; 8.507; 6.516
- Generated constants: 11.086; 8.788; 7.355

**How to fix**
- If Table 1 truly reports **standardized coefficients only**, the constant should correspond to the *unstandardized* DV scale with unstandardized predictors, or to a particular centering scheme. Your mismatch suggests:
  - different sample mean of DV (due to different N),
  - or you are mixing standardized betas with an intercept from a differently transformed model.
- Decide what you are reproducing:
  - If you run the model on standardized variables, intercept should be ~0.
  - If you compute standardized betas from an unstandardized regression, intercept can be on the DV scale.
- Match the authors’ method: they report standardized betas but also print a constant; that typically means: **run unstandardized OLS, then report standardized betas separately**, while keeping the unstandardized intercept. To match, compute standardized betas post-estimation (using the same sample SDs).

---

## 5) Significance-star mismatches / interpretation errors

### A. Political intolerance stars differ
- **True:** 0.164*** (p < .001)
- **Generated:** 0.166** (p_raw = 0.00147, which is **< .01 but > .001**)

This is not just cosmetic—it reflects different p-values due to N/SE differences.

**How to fix**
- Fix Model 3 sample to N=503 and match the variance estimator/weights. That will change SEs/p-values and should restore *** if the paper had it.

### B. Age in Model 3 should be significant (*), but generated is not
- **True:** Age = 0.110*
- **Generated:** Age = 0.060 (p=0.219)

**How to fix**
- Same as above: correct Model 3 sample/variable construction and weighting.

### C. Southern in Model 3 should be **, generated is marginal
- **True:** Southern = 0.121**
- **Generated:** 0.087 (p=0.067)

**How to fix**
- Again consistent with wrong sample/weights/coding.

## 6) What to change in your pipeline (concrete checklist)

To make the generated analysis match Table 1:

1. **Rebuild Hispanic**
   - Identify the original variable(s) for ethnicity/race and create:
     - `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` (with White as reference, likely).
   - Verify counts match paper’s descriptive stats (if available).

2. **Match the paper’s estimation samples**
   - Enforce the same inclusion criteria as the authors (year=1993 appears right).
   - Replicate their missingness rules for:
     - income per capita,
     - prestige,
     - the political intolerance scale/index (avoid overly strict item completeness if the authors used partial scoring).
   - Target Ns: **787**, **756**, **503**.

3. **Use the same weighting/variance approach**
   - If the study uses survey weights (common in sociology with GSS), apply them.
   - If stars are based on design-based SEs (survey package), use the same method.

4. **Standardized coefficients: compute the same way**
   - Preferred for matching tables like this:
     - Fit **unstandardized OLS** on the model sample (possibly weighted),
     - then compute standardized betas using **SDs from that same sample** (weighted SDs if weighted model),
     - report those standardized betas in the table.
   - Do not standardize using the full dataset if the paper standardizes within-model.

5. **Table formatting**
   - Remove standard errors from the main table output (since Table 1 doesn’t show them).
   - Keep only standardized coefficients + stars, plus constant, R², adj R², N.

## 7) Summary of “every mismatch” (quick list)

- **Missing variable:** Hispanic absent in generated Model 2 & 3.
- **Model Ns wrong:** Model 1 (758 vs 787), Model 3 (426 vs 503).
- **R²/Adj R² wrong:** especially Model 3 (0.139/0.117 vs 0.169/0.148).
- **Constants wrong:** all three models.
- **Standardized coefficients differ** for many predictors (education, prestige, age, southern, etc.).
- **Prestige sign mismatch in Model 2** (true -0.006 vs generated +0.006).
- **Significance stars mismatched:** political intolerance (*** vs **), age and southern in Model 3 (significant in true, not in generated).
- **Standard errors printed in generated table** despite true Table 1 not printing SEs (presentation mismatch).

If you share the code that constructs `income_pc`, `political_intolerance`, and the race/ethnicity dummies (or a codebook/variable list), I can pinpoint which specific transformation (weights, strict complete-case rule, or recode) is causing the N drop and the coefficient/significance shifts.
