============================================================

Below is a variable-by-variable and model-by-model audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True (Table 1) Results**, covering **names, coefficients (β), constants, fit stats (N/R²/adj. R²), and interpretation/significance**—plus what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the table.

---

## 1) Core structural discrepancies (these cascade into many mismatches)

### A. Sample size (N) is wrong in every model
**Generated fit_stats N**
- Model 1: **747** (true **787**)
- Model 2: **507** (true **756**)
- Model 3: **286** (true **503**)

**Why it matters:** With different case counts you will not match β’s, p-values, constants, or R².

**Fix**
1. Reproduce the paper’s **exact analytic sample** rules.
2. Do **not** listwise-delete on variables that are not in that model.
   - Your “missingness” block shows very high missingness on race and pol_intol; it looks like you may be (a) using variables from a later model too early, or (b) coding race in a way that introduces missingness.
3. For each model, define the dataset as:
   - Model 1: complete cases on {educ_yrs, inc_pc, prestg80_v, outcome}
   - Model 2: complete cases on Model 2 vars (adds demographics)
   - Model 3: complete cases on Model 3 vars (adds pol_intol)
4. Confirm N matches: **787 / 756 / 503** respectively.

---

### B. You mixed coefficient types (unstandardized b vs standardized β)
The **True table reports standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors, and **unstandardized constants**. Your generated outputs show both:
- `model*_full` includes **b** and **beta**
- `model*_table1style` uses **beta** values (good in principle)

But: your βs still don’t match the true βs, which strongly suggests the **sample** and/or **variable coding** differ (see below).

**Fix**
- Compute **standardized coefficients** exactly as the authors did (typically: z-score predictors and outcome, OLS; or post-hoc standardization via SD ratios). Then report those βs in the “Table1style”.
- Keep **constants unstandardized** (as the paper does). This requires fitting the model on original metric but computing standardized β separately, or fitting on standardized variables and then manually inserting the original-metric constant (more complex). Easiest: fit on original variables; compute standardized betas post-estimation.

---

### C. “Other race” is dropped/NA in generated models but present in true table
Generated:
- Model 2: `Other race` = **NaN** and fit_stats says **dropped otherrace**
- Model 3: same

True:
- Model 2: Other race **β = 0.005**
- Model 3: Other race **β = 0.053**

**Likely causes**
- Perfect collinearity (e.g., you included all race dummies plus an intercept, or miscoded a factor with a reference category incorrectly).
- Or `otherrace` is mostly missing due to coding (your missingness says ~35% missing for each race dummy—unusually high for a dummy unless constructed incorrectly).

**Fix**
- Ensure race is coded as **one categorical variable** (e.g., `race` with categories White/Black/Hispanic/Other), then include it as a factor with **White as the reference** (intercept included).
  - If using dummies: include **only three** (Black, Hispanic, Other) and leave White implicit.
- Fix missingness in race variables: do not create missing values for “White”; code White as 0 on all three dummies, not NA.
- After correct coding, `Other race` should estimate (not drop) and yield a β close to the table.

## 2) Model-by-model coefficient mismatches (β) and constants

### Model 1 (SES)

**Fit statistics mismatches**
- R²: generated **0.088** vs true **0.107**
- Adj R²: generated **0.085** vs true **0.104**
- N: generated **747** vs true **787**

**Coefficients (β) mismatches**
- Education: generated **-0.292*** vs true **-0.322*** (too small in magnitude)
- Income: generated **-0.039** vs true **-0.037** (close)
- Prestige: generated **0.020** vs true **0.016** (close)

**Constant mismatch**
- generated **10.638** vs true **10.920**

**Fix**
- Primary: match the **sample N=787** and the exact coding/scaling of education, income per capita, prestige, and outcome.
- Verify the dependent variable construction: the paper’s DV is **Number of Music Genres Disliked**; your variable name in missingness suggests `num_genres_disliked` (good), but ensure it’s computed identically (range, exclusions, handling of “don’t know,” etc.).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

**Fit statistics mismatches**
- R²: generated **0.135** vs true **0.151**
- Adj R²: generated **0.118** vs true **0.139**
- N: generated **507** vs true **756**
- Dropped variable: generated drops **otherrace**, but true includes it.

**β mismatches (Generated β → True β)**
- Education: **-0.264*** → **-0.246*** (too negative)
- Income: **-0.053** → **-0.054** (match)
- Prestige: **-0.016** → **-0.006** (too negative)
- Female: **-0.090***? (your star is `*`) → **-0.083***? (true has `*`) (close)
- Age: **0.104***? (`*`) → **0.140*** (too small; also significance differs: true is ***)
- Black: **0.043** → **0.029** (close-ish)
- Hispanic: **0.030** → **-0.029** (**sign is wrong**)
- Other race: missing/dropped → **0.005** (present)
- Cons. Protestant: **0.090** → **0.059** (too large)
- No religion: **-0.019** → **-0.012** (close)
- Southern: **0.063** → **0.097** (**too small; significance mismatch: true is **)

**Constant mismatch**
- generated **9.285** vs true **8.507** (substantial)

**Fix priorities**
1. **Restore the correct N=756** (your model is using far fewer cases).
2. **Fix Hispanic coding** (your sign flip is a red flag):
   - Ensure Hispanic is 1 for Hispanic, 0 otherwise; not reversed, not including “not asked” as 1, etc.
   - Ensure the reference race is White (implicit), not Hispanic.
3. Fix race dummy construction so **Other race is estimable**.
4. Re-check **Age** variable (scale/transform):
   - If you used `age_v` as-is, fine; but if the paper used age in decades or centered age, that will alter β slightly (though β should be invariant to linear rescaling of X if Y is standardized—but only if done properly; errors in standardization or missingness can still change it).
5. Confirm **Southern** coding matches GSS “South” region definition used by authors.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

**Fit statistics mismatches**
- R²: generated **0.145** vs true **0.169**
- Adj R²: generated **0.111** vs true **0.148**
- N: generated **286** vs true **503**
- Dropped Other race again (should not be dropped)

**β mismatches (Generated β → True β)**
- Education: **-0.157***? (`*`) → **-0.151** (true is **; yours is *; magnitude close)
- Income: **-0.050** → **-0.009** (**way off**; suggests different income variable or scaling/coding/sample)
- Prestige: **-0.011** → **-0.022** (off)
- Female: **-0.122***? (`*`) → **-0.095* **(too negative)
- Age: **0.083** → **0.110* **(too small; significance mismatch)
- Black: **0.107** → **0.049** (too large)
- Hispanic: **0.028** → **0.031** (close)
- Other race: missing → **0.053** (present)
- Cons Protestant: **0.037** → **0.066** (too small)
- No religion: **0.024** → **0.024** (matches)
- Southern: **0.065** → **0.121** (too small; significance mismatch)
- Political intolerance: **0.190** (**) → **0.164*** (**magnitude too large; star level differs**)

**Constant mismatch**
- generated **7.360** vs true **6.516**

**Fix priorities**
1. **Get N to 503** by applying the paper’s missing-data handling and correct variable coding.
2. Verify the **political intolerance scale** construction:
   - Your label says “0–15”; the paper’s “Political intolerance” is likely a summed scale; you must match item selection, coding, and missing handling (e.g., require at least k items answered, or treat DK as missing).
   - If your scale has different variance, standardized β will change.
3. Investigate why **income β is -0.050** instead of **-0.009**:
   - This looks like you might be using a *different income measure* (not per capita, not the same year dollars, or logged vs not).
   - Or the severe sample restriction (N=286) is distorting the estimate.

## 3) Standard errors: reported vs not reported (and interpretation issues)

### A. The true table does not report SEs; generated output implies inferential precision from p-values
The “True Results” explicitly say **SEs are not reported**; only stars are shown. Your generated tables provide p-values (and implicitly SEs in the background). That’s not a “mismatch” in the strict sense unless you claim Table 1 contains SEs—but it *is* an interpretive mismatch if your narrative treats SEs/p-values as table-extracted.

**Fix**
- For a replication-style table, report **β and stars only**, omitting SEs/p-values (or clearly label them as computed from your replication, not extracted from the paper).
- Align star cutoffs to the paper: * <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001 (you appear to use that, but because your estimates/p differ, stars diverge).

### B. “Interpretation” mismatches caused by sign errors and star-level differences
Key substantive interpretation conflicts:
- **Hispanic (Model 2)**: generated positive, true negative. This flips the story.
- **Age and Southern**: generated weaker and often nonsignificant; true is stronger and significant.
- **Political intolerance**: generated larger β but weaker star than true (true is ***). That suggests your p-value is not as small as it should be—again likely sample/scale issues.

**Fix**
- Do not interpret coefficients until (1) sample sizes match and (2) variable coding matches.

---

## 4) Variable naming / labeling mismatches

### A. Inconsistent naming between “Generated Results” and “missingness”
Generated tables use labels like:
- “Education (years)”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”

Missingness uses raw names:
- `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, `pol_intol`, `otherrace`, etc.

This is not inherently wrong, but it becomes a replication problem if labels obscure that the underlying variables may not match the paper’s exact operationalization.

**Fix**
- In your replication output, include both: **label + raw variable name** (e.g., “Education (years) [educ_yrs]”).
- Ensure the underlying raw variable corresponds to the paper’s measure (year, coding, trimming, etc.).

---

## 5) A concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Recreate the DV exactly** (Number of music genres disliked), including handling of missing/DK/NA.
2. **Recreate Political intolerance** exactly as in the paper (items, coding, missing rule, range).
3. **Race coding**: build a single race factor or proper dummy set so:
   - White is reference
   - Black/Hispanic/Other are 0/1 with **no structural missingness**
   - “Other race” is not collinear and is estimable
4. **Model-specific listwise deletion** only on variables in that model.
5. Confirm the resulting **N** equals **787, 756, 503**.
6. Compute **standardized β** in the same way as the authors and report those in the Table1-style output; keep constants unstandardized.
7. Only after all above: verify **R²/adj R²** match (0.107/0.104; 0.151/0.139; 0.169/0.148) and then compare β term-by-term.

If you share the actual code (or at least: how you constructed race and political intolerance, and how you filtered/missing-dropped cases per model), I can pinpoint exactly which line(s) are creating the N collapse and the Hispanic sign flip, and give an exact corrected specification.
