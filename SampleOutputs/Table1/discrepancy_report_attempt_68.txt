Score: 24/100
============================================================

Below is a complete discrepancy audit between the **Generated Results** and the **True (paper) Table 1**. I separate (a) *mechanical mismatches* (names, Ns, coefficients) from (b) *interpretation/reporting mismatches*, then give concrete fixes so the generated output can be made to match the paper.

---

## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (R², adjusted R², N)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N mismatch**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller. Use the same case-selection rules as the paper (likely different missing-data handling and/or variable coding). At minimum, ensure you:
    - restrict to **GSS 1993** (and the exact subsample used by the author),
    - use the same definitions for income per capita / prestige / education,
    - apply the same missing-data rule (paper likely uses listwise deletion *within model*, but your missingness table suggests substantial missingness on some items; see Section 5).

- **R² mismatch**
  - Generated: **0.0883**
  - True: **0.107**
- **Adjusted R² mismatch**
  - Generated: **0.0846**
  - True: **0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample and variable coding match the paper, R² should move. If it does not, you are not estimating the same specification (e.g., weights, transformations, or dependent variable definition differ).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N mismatch**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
- **R² mismatch**
  - Generated: **0.1387**
  - True: **0.151**
- **Adjusted R² mismatch**
  - Generated: **0.1196**
  - True: **0.139**
  - **Fix:** The N gap is huge (249 cases). This is almost certainly from (i) different missing-data treatment, (ii) different coding of race/ethnicity/religion, or (iii) accidentally requiring non-missingness on variables not in the model (e.g., pol_intol). Ensure Model 2’s dataset requires non-missingness **only** on Model 2 variables + outcome.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N mismatch**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
- **R² mismatch**
  - Generated: **0.1486**
  - True: **0.169**
- **Adjusted R² mismatch**
  - Generated: **0.1112**
  - True: **0.148**
  - **Fix:** Again, likely listwise deletion is being applied too aggressively (e.g., requiring complete data on additional variables beyond Model 3, or misconstructed pol_intol causing excessive missingness). Your missingness table shows **pol_intol is 47% missing**, which alone could push N down—but the paper’s Model 3 still has 503, so your pol_intol variable is probably **not coded the same way** (or you are using an item that is missing for many more respondents than the paper’s index).

---

## 2) Variable name / labeling mismatches

### Dependent variable name
- Generated uses/labels: `num_genres_disliked` (and table refers to “Number of Music Genres Disliked” implicitly)
- True: “Number of Music Genres Disliked”
- **No substantive mismatch** as long as `num_genres_disliked` is the same constructed count used in the paper.
- **Fix check:** Confirm the genre list and coding rules match the paper (e.g., which genres included; handling of “don’t know”; whether “dislike” includes “strongly dislike,” etc.). If not identical, coefficients and R² will differ.

### Predictor naming consistency
- Generated labels match conceptually, but you should verify these map **exactly** to the paper’s measures:
  - `educ_yrs` → Education (years)
  - `inc_pc` → Household income per capita
  - `prestg80_v` → Occupational prestige
  - `cons_prot` → Conservative Protestant
  - `norelig` → No religion
  - `south` → Southern
  - `pol_intol` → Political intolerance (0–15)

**Main risk:** Even if labels match, the **coding** may not (especially `inc_pc`, `pol_intol`, race/ethnicity dummies, and prestige scale).

---

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model (including sign and magnitude)

Important: the paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)**; your generated tables report **both** unstandardized `b` and standardized `beta`. Comparisons to the paper must be done using **beta**, not b.

### Model 1 (SES): β mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | magnitude off |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | small difference |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | small difference |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | mismatch |

**Fix:** Align sample (N 787) and variable construction. The constant being off is expected if the sample differs; if you used different scaling for outcome or predictors, it will also shift.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic): β mismatches (and sign errors)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | magnitude off |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | small difference |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | small difference |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close |
| **Age** | **0.103***? (actually sig “*” in your output) | **0.140*** | magnitude + significance off |
| Black | 0.100 | 0.029 | large difference |
| **Hispanic** | **0.074** | **-0.029** | **sign mismatch** |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **0.005** | sign mismatch |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.087 | 0.059 | magnitude off |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | close |
| **Southern** | **0.061** | **0.097** | magnitude + significance mismatch (yours is ns; true is **) |
| Constant | 8.675 | 8.507 | mismatch |

**Fixes (likely causes):**
1. **Race/ethnicity coding is not the same.**
   - Your “Hispanic” and “Other race” signs differ from the paper, which often indicates a different reference category or overlapping dummies (e.g., Hispanic not mutually exclusive with race).
   - **Fix:** Recreate mutually exclusive categories exactly as the paper:
     - Typically: White (reference), Black, Hispanic, Other (all mutually exclusive).
     - Ensure Hispanic respondents are not simultaneously counted as White/Black.
2. **Age variable scaling or sample differs.**
   - Paper has much stronger age effect (0.140***). Your smaller N (507 vs 756) could reduce both precision and magnitude.
   - **Fix:** Use same age coding (years, not categories; treat missing like paper).
3. **Southern and religion differences usually reflect sample/coding differences or weights.**
   - If the paper uses GSS weights and you do not, coefficients can shift and stars can change.
   - **Fix:** Check whether the paper uses weights (common in GSS analyses). If yes, apply the same weight (e.g., `WTSSALL` or year-appropriate weight).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): β mismatches (several sign and star differences)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | stars mismatch |
| **Income pc** | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | **large magnitude mismatch** |
| Prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | difference |
| **Female** | **-0.127***? (your star is *) | **-0.095***? (paper *) | magnitude mismatch |
| **Age** | **0.091 (ns)** | **0.110*** | magnitude + significance mismatch |
| Black | 0.060 | 0.049 | close |
| **Hispanic** | **-0.030** | **0.031** | **sign mismatch** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.036 | 0.066 | magnitude mismatch |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | matches |
| **Southern** | **0.068 (ns)** | **0.121** | magnitude + significance mismatch |
| Political intolerance | 0.184** | 0.164*** | stars + magnitude mismatch |
| **Constant** | **7.999** | **6.516** | mismatch |

**Fixes (likely causes):**
1. **Political intolerance scale construction differs.**
   - Your `pol_intol` has 47% missing; the paper’s Model 3 retains 503 cases, implying a less-missing index or different imputation/rules.
   - **Fix:** Rebuild the intolerance index exactly as in the paper (which items; summing vs averaging; treatment of “don’t know”; allowable missing items; rescaling to 0–15).
2. **Income per capita is almost certainly not comparable.**
   - Paper β is near zero (-0.009). Yours is much larger (-0.052), suggesting:
     - different income measure (raw vs per-capita; logged; top-coded; inflation adjusted),
     - or per-capita division differs (household size, adult equivalents),
     - or you standardized differently (e.g., including zeros/missing coded values).
   - **Fix:** Audit `inc_pc` construction: remove invalid codes, apply the same transformation, and then standardize on the estimation sample.
3. **Hispanic sign flips again.**
   - Same race/ethnicity dummy problem as Model 2.
   - **Fix:** enforce mutually exclusive categories and correct reference group.

---

## 4) Standard errors: reporting mismatch

- **True results:** Table reports **no SEs** (only β and stars; constants unstandardized).
- **Generated results:** You do not report SEs either in `table1_panel`, but you *do* show p-values/stars computed from a model that includes SEs internally.
- **Mismatch in principle:** The task asks for mismatches in SEs; but the true table has **no SEs to compare**, so you cannot validate SEs.
- **Fix:** If your goal is to match the paper’s table, **do not present SEs** and do not claim they match. Present β and stars only, and replicate the paper’s star cutoffs.

---

## 5) Interpretation / significance-star mismatches (multiple)

### Model 3: Political intolerance significance
- Generated: **0.184** with ** (p≈0.0038)
- True: **0.164*** (p<.001)
- **Fix:** This is likely due to different N (286 vs 503) and/or different pol_intol construction. Fix the index + sample first; stars should align.

### Model 2: Age and Southern significance
- Generated: Age only *; Southern ns
- True: Age ***; Southern **
- **Fix:** sample/coding/weights. With correct N and coding, Age should strengthen; Southern should become significant.

### Model 3: Education stars
- Generated: -0.155*
- True: -0.151**
- **Fix:** sample size and/or correct standardization procedure (paper’s β computed on a different sample; your N is much smaller, reducing significance).

---

## 6) Internal inconsistencies within the Generated output

### “table1_panel” vs “*_full”
- `table1_panel` entries appear to be standardized betas, but they’re rounded and include stars.
- `model*_full` provides both `b` and `beta` with p-values.
- **No direct inconsistency** there, but you should ensure:
  - `table1_panel` uses **the same beta values** as in `model*_full` (it seems it does),
  - stars in `table1_panel` are computed from the same p-values (they appear consistent).

### Dropped predictors column is blank
- Fit stats shows `dropped_predictors` empty.
- Given huge N reductions across models, something *effectively* is dropping cases, not predictors.
- **Fix:** Add explicit reporting of **listwise deletion counts by variable** per model, and verify you are not accidentally filtering on `pol_intol` for Models 1–2.

---

## 7) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Recreate the exact analytic sample**
   - Filter to **GSS 1993** and any other eligibility criteria the paper uses.
   - For each model, do **model-specific listwise deletion** only on variables in that model + DV.
   - Verify you recover Ns close to: **787, 756, 503**.

2. **Rebuild key constructed variables to match the paper**
   - **Political intolerance (0–15):** match items, scoring, handling of DK/NA, and allowable missing items.
   - **Household income per capita:** confirm:
     - which income variable from GSS,
     - how household size is used,
     - whether any transformations (e.g., log) or top-code handling is applied.
   - **Occupational prestige:** ensure the same prestige scale/version and missing-code handling.

3. **Fix race/ethnicity dummy coding (major sign problems)**
   - Make categories mutually exclusive and confirm the **reference group** matches the paper.
   - A common correct setup:
     - reference = non-Hispanic White
     - dummies: Black (non-Hispanic), Hispanic (any race or Hispanic-only category depending on paper), Other race (non-Hispanic non-White non-Black)
   - The paper’s signs (Hispanic negative in Model 2 but positive in Model 3) are subtle; your consistent sign flips strongly suggest misclassification.

4. **Match weighting (if used)**
   - Check the paper’s methods for weights. If weighted OLS was used, apply the same weight variable and reproduce with robust/standard SEs as appropriate (even if SEs aren’t shown, weights affect β and stars).

5. **Standardization procedure**
   - The paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)**. Ensure you compute β in the same way:
     - either estimate OLS on z-scored variables (excluding constant), or compute β from unstandardized b using SDs from the estimation sample.
   - Standardize using the **same estimation sample per model** (not the full dataset), or you will not match.

6. **Report format to match**
   - Output β and stars (no SEs), unstandardized constant, plus R²/adj R²/N per model.

## Quick checklist of “every mismatch” (most consequential)
- **Ns wrong in all models** (747 vs 787; 507 vs 756; 286 vs 503).
- **R²/adj R² wrong in all models.**
- **Model 2 Hispanic sign wrong** (+0.074 vs -0.029).
- **Model 2 Other race sign wrong** (-0.027 vs +0.005).
- **Model 3 Hispanic sign wrong** (-0.030 vs +0.031).
- **Model 3 income β wildly off** (-0.052 vs -0.009).
- **Age effect too small and under-significant** (Models 2–3).
- **Southern effect too small and non-significant** (Models 2–3).
- **Political intolerance magnitude and stars off** (Model 3).
- **Constants off** (all models), consistent with sample/coding differences.

If you tell me (or paste) the exact code you used to construct **pol_intol**, **inc_pc**, and the **race/ethnicity dummies**, I can pinpoint which specific coding decisions produce the sign flips and N losses and give the exact corrected recodes.
