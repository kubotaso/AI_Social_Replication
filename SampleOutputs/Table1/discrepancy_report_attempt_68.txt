Below is a line-by-line audit of **every place the generated output fails to match the “true” (PDF Table 1) results**, grouped by (A) variable names / inclusion, (B) coefficients & stars, (C) standard errors, (D) fit stats and N, and (E) interpretation/what must be stated. For each mismatch I give a concrete fix so the generated analysis can be made to match the printed table.

---

## A) Variable names and what the table is actually reporting

### A1) Generated table mixes *standardized* and *raw* output
- **True table:** “Standardized OLS coefficients (as printed)” and **no standard errors printed**.
- **Generated table1_style:** shows one coefficient column per model, but it’s ambiguous whether those are standardized; then it shows another row underneath each coefficient that looks like an SE (or something SE-like).  
- **Generated coefficients_long:** contains *both* `beta_std` and `b_raw` and p-values for `b_raw`.

**Fix**
1. Decide what you are reproducing: **the PDF Table 1**. Then output **only standardized betas** in the table body.
2. Remove (or hide) all SE rows from the “as-printed” replication table because the PDF doesn’t provide them.
3. If you still want SEs for your own appendix, label them explicitly as “computed SEs (not in PDF)” and do **not** claim they match Table 1.

### A2) Variable naming mismatches (minor but should be aligned)
The PDF labels are human-readable; your generated output uses dataset-style names.

- **True labels:** “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, “Conservative Protestant”, “No religion”, “Political intolerance”.
- **Generated terms:** `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `political_intolerance`.

**Fix**
- Map variable names in the output table to the PDF labels (pure presentation fix), e.g.:
  - `educ` → Education  
  - `income_pc` → Household income per capita  
  - `prestg80` → Occupational prestige  
  - `conservative_protestant` → Conservative Protestant  
  - `no_religion` → No religion  
  - `political_intolerance` → Political intolerance  

This won’t change estimates, but it removes avoidable mismatch.

| N | 756 | 523 | **huge mismatch** |

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.151** | **-0.157***? (generated marks as *) | coefficient close, star differs |
| Income per capita | -0.009 | -0.067 | **large mismatch** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.022 | -0.008 | mismatch |
| Female | **-0.095***? (true shows -0.095*) | **-0.118*** (generated *) | mismatch |
| Age | **0.110***? (true shows 0.110*) | 0.092 (ns) | mismatch + star mismatch |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.004 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | 0.091 | mismatch |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches (this one matches) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.066 | -0.011 | mismatch **and sign flips** |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.018 | mismatch |

| Political intolerance | **0.164*** | **0.196** (**) | coefficient + star mismatch |
| Constant | 6.516 | 7.583 | mismatch |
| R² | 0.169 | 0.152 | mismatch |
| Adj R² | 0.148 | 0.115 | mismatch |
| N | 503 | 293 | **huge mismatch** |

**Core diagnosis:** These are not “rounding differences.” The patterns (big N differences; big coefficient shifts; sign flips) strongly suggest you are not using the same **sample**, **coding**, and/or **construction of the political intolerance scale**, and you may be using different **weights** or **year restrictions** than the PDF.

## C) Standard errors: generated output cannot match because the true table doesn’t report them

### C1) Generated prints SE-like numbers in table1_style
The second line under each coefficient (e.g., Education has “-0.332***” then “-0.034”) looks like an SE, but:
- The **true table prints no SEs**, so there is nothing to match.
- Also those SEs are suspiciously small for standardized coefficients in some cases, and the formatting doesn’t label them.

**Fix**
- Remove SE rows from the replication table.
- If you must keep them, label clearly: “(Computed SE of standardized coefficient)”—and compute them consistently (see next point).

### C2) Your p-values/stars are based on raw b’s, while the table stars refer to standardized coefficients (as printed)
- **Generated diagnostics note:** “stars from p-values of raw coefficients (betas shown).”
- **True table:** stars are attached to the **standardized coefficients as printed**. In OLS, the *t*-test significance is invariant to linear rescaling of a regressor, so in principle stars should match between raw and standardized *if the same sample and coding are used*. But since your sample/coding differs, stars also diverge.

**Fix**
- First fix sample/coding (Section D/E).  
- Then compute stars from the same model fit; you can still compute p-values from the raw coefficient tests, but ensure they correspond to the same regression that produced the printed standardized betas.

## D) Fit stats and sample sizes: major mismatches

### D1) N is drastically smaller in generated results in Models 2 and 3
- **True N:** 787 / 756 / 503
- **Generated N:** 758 / 523 / 293

Your own missingness tables explain why: you are dropping huge numbers due to `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`.

#### D1a) Hispanic missingness is causing massive listwise deletion
- Generated: `hispanic` has **281 missing** (out of 893 DV-complete), which collapses Model 2 from 758-ish potential down to 523.
- In the PDF table, they clearly retained far more cases in the demographic model (N=756), meaning their Hispanic variable is not missing for ~281 people in the analysis sample.

**Fix (most likely)**
- Recode Hispanic from the original ethnicity/race question correctly.
  - Common GSS pattern: “Hispanic” is often derived from an `ethnic` indicator where non-response/NA should not be treated as missing if you can infer Hispanic=0.
- Practical fix approach:
  1. Create `hispanic = 1` if respondent identifies as Hispanic/Latino (per codebook variable).
  2. Set `hispanic = 0` for all known non-Hispanic respondents, **even if the Hispanic-origin question is missing**, when the survey design implies missing = “not asked” or “inapplicable” rather than “unknown”.
  3. Only keep as missing when truly unknown (e.g., explicit “don’t know/refused”)—and even then check how the original authors handled it.

Your generated diagnostic “ethnic==1 (non-missing); missing ethnic kept as missing” is likely the mistake: **treating “not Hispanic” as missing** for a large portion of the sample.

#### D1b) Political intolerance missingness is even more destructive
- Generated: `political_intolerance` has **402 missing** out of 893 DV-complete → leaves only 491 potentially, and after other covariates only N=293.
- True Model 3 has N=503—so the authors had far fewer missing (or they constructed the scale differently and kept more people).

**Fix**
- Reconstruct the political intolerance scale exactly as in the paper:
  - Verify which items are included (often multiple “allow … speak/teach/book” items).
  - Verify whether “don’t know” is treated as missing vs coded as tolerant/intolerant.
  - Verify the rule for scale creation: e.g., **mean of answered items**, **sum**, and crucially **minimum items required** (e.g., require at least 1 item vs require all items).
- Your diagnostics show “items answered min=0 max=15”; if you allow 0 answered → you should set the scale to missing when 0 answered, but the bigger issue is likely that you required too many items or used the wrong source questions/year.

### D2) Constants don’t match (especially Models 2 and 3)
- True constants: 10.920 / 8.507 / 6.516
- Generated constants: 11.086 / 10.089 / 7.583

This is consistent with **different sample composition** and possibly **different centering/scaling** of DV or predictors.

**Fix**
- Once you align:
  1) the exact sample restrictions (year, age, valid DV range),
  2) the exact coding of all covariates,
  3) weights (if used),
the constants should move toward the printed values. If the paper used **weights** (common in GSS work), unweighted vs weighted can shift the intercept and coefficients.

### D3) R² and adjusted R² don’t match
Given OLS, if your N and coefficients differ, R² will differ. Here Model 3 is notably off (true .169 vs generated .152).

**Fix**
- Align sample + coding first; then confirm you are computing R² on the same basis (weighted vs unweighted; handling of missing; any robust/cluster adjustments don’t change R² but weights do).

---

## E) Interpretation mismatches (what the generated analysis would imply vs what the true table implies)

### E1) Education effect in Model 2 is overstated in generated output
- True: -0.246***
- Generated: -0.302***
This would lead the narrative to overclaim the magnitude of education’s association once demographics are added.

**Fix**
- Don’t “interpret around” the wrong coefficient. Fix sample/coding until standardized beta matches -0.246 (within rounding).

### E2) Income per capita in Model 3 is completely wrong in generated output
- True: -0.009 (essentially null)
- Generated: -0.067 (nontrivial negative)
That changes the substantive conclusion (income matters vs does not).

**Fix**
- This is a red flag for sample/coding problems in Model 3 (political intolerance variable construction and/or listwise deletion). Fix Model 3 construction so income collapses toward ~0.

### E3) Southern and Political intolerance effects: star/magnitude disagreement
- True: Southern is **positive and significant** in both Models 2 and 3; political intolerance is **0.164***.
- Generated: Southern becomes smaller and often non-sig; political intolerance is larger (0.196**) but with weaker stars than ***.

**Fix**
- Again points to wrong Model 3 sample and potentially different intolerance scale. Rebuild the scale and inclusion rules; check weights.

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the PDF Table 1 (action checklist)

1. **Replicate the exact sample restrictions used in the paper**
   - Same survey year(s) (your diagnostics mention 1993; confirm the PDF uses exactly that year and no additional filters).
   - Same valid-case rules for DV and each predictor.

2. **Fix the Hispanic indicator to avoid artificial missingness**
   - Recode so “not Hispanic” is coded 0 rather than missing for “not asked/inapplicable”.
   - Confirm that after recoding, Model 2 N rises from ~523 toward **756**.

3. **Reconstruct political intolerance exactly**
   - Use the same items, same coding direction, same aggregation (sum/mean), and same minimum-items rule.
   - Target Model 3 N to rise from **293** toward **503**.

4. **Check whether the original table is weighted**
   - If the paper used weights, re-estimate with the same weight variable and method (weighted least squares).
   - This can affect coefficients, intercepts, and R².

5. **Print the table in the same format as Table 1**
   - Output standardized coefficients only.
   - Do **not** print SEs (or clearly separate them as “not in PDF”).
   - Apply stars exactly as printed (once the model matches, your stars should align automatically).

If you paste the paper’s exact variable definitions for **Hispanic**, **political intolerance** (items + scoring), and whether **weights** were used, I can point to the specific recoding rule that explains each large coefficient/N discrepancy and how to implement it.
