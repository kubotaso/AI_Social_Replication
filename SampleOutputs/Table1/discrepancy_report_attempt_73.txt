## 1) Fit statistics / sample sizes

### Mismatches
- **n differs in every model**
  - Generated: **M1 n=747**, **M2 n=507**, **M3 n=286**
  - True: **M1 n=787**, **M2 n=756**, **M3 n=503**
- **R² and adjusted R² are too low in the generated output**
  - Model 1: gen **R²=.088** vs true **.107**; gen **adj R²=.085** vs true **.104**
  - Model 2: gen **R²=.138** vs true **.151**; gen **adj R²=.119** vs true **.139**
  - Model 3: gen **R²=.148** vs true **.169**; gen **adj R²=.114** vs true **.148**
- Generated reports **“dropped_predictors: hispanic”** in Model 3; the true table includes Hispanic with a coefficient.

### How to fix
- **Replicate the paper’s estimation sample rules.** Your generated “missingness” table shows huge missingness for `pol_intol` (47%). But the true Model 3 still has **n=503**, not 286. That implies your construction/coding of political intolerance (and/or other covariates) is discarding too many cases compared to the paper.
  - Rebuild `pol_intol` exactly as in the paper (item set, valid skip patterns, recodes, range 0–15, treatment of “don’t know,” “not asked,” inapplicable).
  - Ensure you’re using the **same GSS subset (1993)** and the same inclusion criteria (e.g., adults only, valid music module respondents).
- **Do not drop “Hispanic” due to collinearity/zero variance** unless it truly has no variation *in the paper’s sample*. In your Model 3 sample profile, `hispanic` has mean 0 and sd 0 (all zeros), which is why it becomes NaN. That is a strong sign your Model 3 sample is wrongly restricted.

## 2) Variable-by-variable coefficient (β) mismatches (Table 1 style)

Below I compare the **standardized coefficients (β)** that Table 1 reports (and that your `model*_table1style` appears to be trying to reproduce).

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | No |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | Slightly off |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | Slightly off |
| Constant (unstd.) | **10.638** | **10.920** | No |

**Fix:** Once the **sample size matches (n=787)** and variables are coded identically, these should move toward the true values. Right now the gaps are consistent with using a different analytic sample.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.266*** | **-0.246*** | No |
| Income pc | **-0.054** | **-0.054** | Yes |
| Prestige | **-0.010** | **-0.006** | No (small) |
| Female | **-0.089***? (listed -0.089*) | **-0.083***? (true -0.083*) | No (small) |
| Age | **0.102***? (listed 0.102*) | **0.140*** | No (substantive) |
| Black | **0.037** | **0.029** | No (small) |
| Hispanic | **-0.033** | **-0.029** | No (small) |
| Other race | **-0.027** | **0.005** | **No (sign flips)** |
| Cons. Prot. | **0.083** | **0.059** | No |
| No religion | **-0.018** | **-0.012** | No (small) |
| Southern | **0.060** | **0.097** | **No (substantive)** |
| Constant | **9.663** | **8.507** | **No (large)** |

**Fixes (most important):**
- Get the sample to **n=756** (your n=507 is far smaller). That alone can change the age and regional effects a lot.
- Investigate **race coding**: your “Other race” is negative while the paper reports slightly positive. Common sources:
  - Different reference category (e.g., including race dummies incorrectly with/without intercept)
  - Different construction of “other race” (e.g., combining Asian/Native/etc. vs a residual category)
- Ensure **weights**: many published GSS regressions use a weight (e.g., `WTSSALL` or older weights). If the paper used weights and you did not (or vice versa), coefficients (especially age/region) and constants can shift.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.157***? (listed -0.157*) | **-0.151** ** | Close but stars differ |
| Income pc | **-0.050** | **-0.009** | **No (large)** |
| Prestige | **-0.015** | **-0.022** | No (small/moderate) |
| Female | **-0.126***? | **-0.095* ** | No |
| Age | **0.091** (ns) | **0.110* ** | No |
| Black | **0.085** | **0.049** | No |
| Hispanic | **blank/NaN** | **0.031** | **No (missing entirely)** |
| Other race | **0.053** | **0.053** | Yes |
| Cons. Prot. | **0.038** | **0.066** | No |
| No religion | **0.024** | **0.024** | Yes |
| Southern | **0.068** | **0.121** | **No (substantive)** |
| Political intolerance | **0.183** ** | **0.164*** | No (value + stars) |
| Constant | **7.635** | **6.516** | **No (large)** |

**Fixes (most important):**
- **Your Model 3 sample is fundamentally wrong** (n=286 vs 503; Hispanic has zero variance). Fixing the `pol_intol` construction and the merging/filtering that creates Model 3 is the priority.
- **Income per capita β is wildly off** (-0.050 vs -0.009). This often happens when:
  - income is coded differently (e.g., raw dollars vs logged, top-coded, or midpoints)
  - per-capita conversion differs (household size adjustment not matching the paper)
  - standardization is done on the wrong sample (not the Model 3 estimation sample)
- After correcting sample and coding, recompute standardized coefficients **within the exact estimation sample** used for each model.

## 3) “Full” model output problems (b, SEs, p-values)

### Mismatches / discrepancies
- The **true table does not report SEs or p-values**, only β and stars. Your generated output includes **unstandardized b**, β, and p-values, and then produces stars.
- Because stars in the paper come from *their* SEs/p-values, your stars will not match unless:
  1) you have the same sample,
  2) same coding,
  3) same weighting,
  4) same SE method (classic OLS vs robust, design-based, etc.).

### How to fix
- If the goal is to match Table 1, the cleanest approach is:
  - estimate OLS exactly as paper did (including **weights** and any **design/robust SE** choices if stated),
  - report **standardized coefficients only** (and constant unstandardized),
  - add stars using the same thresholding.
- If you must show p-values, you need to determine whether the paper used:
  - conventional OLS SE,
  - heteroskedasticity-robust SE,
  - or GSS design-based SE (strata/PSU). Any of these can change significance.

---

## 4) Interpretation / reporting mismatches

### Mismatches
- **Generated Model 3 implies Hispanic was dropped** and therefore cannot be interpreted; the true results interpret a *positive* Hispanic coefficient (β=0.031, ns).
- **Southern effect** is much smaller in generated Models 2–3 (β=.060, .068) than true (.097**, .121**). Any narrative claiming “small/no regional effect” would contradict the true table.

### How to fix
- Do not interpret coefficients from a model where a key dummy has **no variance** (your Model 3 Hispanic).
- Align interpretation to the true direction/magnitude once the model is replicated:
  - Age should be **positive and statistically significant** in Models 2 and 3 in the true table (especially strong in Model 2).
  - Southern should be **positive and significant** in Models 2 and 3 in the true table.

---

## 5) Likely root causes (what to check first)

1. **Wrong construction of `pol_intol`** (or wrong missing-data handling), shrinking Model 3 from 503 to 286.
2. **Different case selection for the DV** `num_genres_disliked` (true n=787 in Model 1 vs your 747).
3. **Weighting/design differences** (can shift coefficients and significance).
4. **Different coding of race categories**, especially “Other race.”
5. **Standardization mismatch**: Table 1 βs should be computed in a way consistent with the paper (typically standardized within estimation sample).

---

## Minimal “to-do” to make generated match true

1. Recreate the **exact analytic samples** for Models 1–3 to hit **n=787 / 756 / 503**.
2. Recode/verify **Hispanic** so it varies in Model 3 (and is not all zeros).
3. Rebuild **political intolerance (0–15)** exactly as paper; verify its missingness and distribution.
4. Confirm whether the paper used **weights**; apply the same.
5. Recompute **standardized coefficients β** on the correct estimation sample and regenerate the Table 1-style output (omit SEs if your target is Table 1).

If you share the code (or at least the exact variable construction steps for `num_genres_disliked`, `inc_pc`, `hispanic`, and `pol_intol`, plus any filters/weights), I can pinpoint which specific line(s) are creating the n drops and the sign flip for “Other race.”
