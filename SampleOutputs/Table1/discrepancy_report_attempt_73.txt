### 1) Table formatting / what is being reported (core discrepancy)
**Mismatch:** Your *Generated Results* table shows **standard errors under each coefficient** and stars based on those SEs/p-values. The *True Results* explicitly state the published Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only** and **does not print SEs**.

**How to fix:**
- If your goal is to match the PDF table, **remove the SE rows entirely** from the printed table and report only standardized betas and stars.
- If you must show SEs, you need to (a) obtain them from the original model output (not the PDF table), and (b) accept you can’t “match” the printed table because SEs aren’t in it.

## 2) Mismatches in coefficients (standardized betas)

Below I list every coefficient where the generated beta differs from the true beta, by model and variable.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332 | -0.322 | too negative by 0.010 |
| Household income per capita | -0.034 | -0.037 | not negative enough by 0.003 |
| Occupational prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | too positive by 0.013 |
| Constant | 11.086 | 10.920 | too high by 0.166 |
| R² | 0.1088 | 0.107 | too high by ~0.0018 |
| Adj. R² | 0.1052 | 0.104 | too high by ~0.0012 |
| N | 758 | 787 | **-29 cases** |

**Fixes likely required:**
1. **Sample restriction mismatch** (your N is smaller). The betas and fit stats will not match until N matches 787.  
   - Your diagnostics say “strict complete-case across all 18 music items”. That is almost certainly stricter than the published table’s rule.
   - Fix: recreate the DV using the same rule as the study (often: compute the dislike count using *available* genre items or allow partial completion, rather than listwise across all 18).
2. **Standardization method mismatch**: You compute standardized betas as `b * SD(x)/SD(y)` *on the estimation sample*. That’s typical, but published betas can differ if:
   - they standardized variables **before** listwise deletion,
   - they used **a different weighting scheme**, or
   - they used **pairwise** vs **listwise** SDs.
   - Fix: use the exact standardization approach used in the original analysis (ideally: standardize all model variables on the exact analytic sample used for that model, then run OLS on z-scored variables).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.259 | -0.246 | too negative by 0.013 |
| Income per capita | -0.050 | -0.054 | not negative enough by 0.004 |
| Occupational prestige | 0.006 | -0.006 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.091 | -0.083 | too negative by 0.008 |
| Age | 0.128 | 0.140 | too small by 0.012 |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.029 | matches |
| Hispanic | **NaN** | -0.029 | **not estimated / coding error** |
| Other race | 0.001 | 0.005 | too small by 0.004 |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.065 | 0.059 | too large by 0.006 |
| No religion | -0.005 | -0.012 | too close to 0 by 0.007 |
| Southern | 0.086 | 0.097 | too small by 0.011 |
| Constant | 8.794 | 8.507 | too high by 0.287 |
| R² | 0.145 | 0.151 | too low by 0.006 |
| Adj. R² | 0.134 | 0.139 | too low by 0.005 |
| N | 755 | 756 | -1 case |

**Two major actionable problems:**
1. **`hispanic` is NaN in your model output** but exists in the true table with a real coefficient (-0.029).  
   This indicates a construction/estimation failure, typically one of:
   - perfect collinearity (e.g., you accidentally coded `hispanic` identical to another dummy or to missing),
   - a non-numeric dtype that got coerced badly,
   - all zeros / no variance in estimation sample,
   - or you inadvertently dropped it in the regression but kept it in the reporting layer.
   
   **Fix:** Verify `hispanic` in the estimation sample:
   - Check counts: `hispanic.value_counts()` and variance.
   - Ensure race dummies follow one reference category (e.g., White omitted), and that *black/hispanic/other_race* are mutually exclusive and correctly coded.
   - Ensure you did **not** also include a full set of race dummies plus an intercept in a way that induces perfect multicollinearity.

2. **Occupational prestige sign differs** (Generated +0.006 vs True -0.006).  
   This is usually caused by:
   - different prestige variable (wrong coding, wrong year/scale), or
   - different analytic sample (selection changes sign near zero), or
   - different standardization (z-scoring before/after transformations).
   
   **Fix:** confirm you are using the exact prestige measure used in the paper (Table 1 says “Occupational prestige”; your variable is `prestg80`). Make sure:
   - `prestg80` is the intended variable and not reverse-coded,
   - missing codes are correctly set to NA,
   - and the sample definition matches the paper (again: DV construction and listwise rules matter).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.161 | -0.151 | too negative by 0.010 |
| Income per capita | -0.012 | -0.009 | too negative by 0.003 |
| Occupational prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | too close to 0 by 0.014 |
| Female | -0.114 | -0.095 | too negative by 0.019 |
| Age | 0.060 | 0.110 | too small by 0.050 |
| Black | 0.062 | 0.049 | too large by 0.013 |
| Hispanic | **NaN** | 0.031 | **not estimated / coding error** |
| Other race | 0.051 | 0.053 | close (diff -0.002) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.053 | 0.066 | too small by 0.013 |
| No religion | 0.020 | 0.024 | too small by 0.004 |
| Southern | 0.087 | 0.121 | too small by 0.034 |
| Political intolerance | 0.166 | 0.164 | close (diff +0.002) |
| Constant | 7.355 | 6.516 | too high by 0.839 |
| R² | 0.139 | 0.169 | too low by 0.030 |
| Adj. R² | 0.117 | 0.148 | too low by 0.031 |
| N | 426 | 503 | **-77 cases** |

**Fixes likely required:**
1. **Big sample mismatch (426 vs 503)** driven by your intolerance scale rule. Your diagnostics say:  
   > “sum of 15 intolerance indicators; require complete on all 15 items”  
   That is extremely strict and will shrink N (you have 402 missing for `political_intolerance`).
   
   **Fix:** replicate the paper’s scale construction:
   - Many papers compute an index if a respondent answers *some minimum number* of items (e.g., ≥ 10 of 15) and then take a mean or prorated sum.
   - Or they use a smaller subset than 15 items.
   - Implement the same rule and you should recover substantially more cases (closer to N=503), and R² should rise toward 0.169.

2. **`hispanic` again NaN**: same problem as Model 2, now compounded by the smaller sample.

3. **Interpretation/significance mismatch for political intolerance:**  
   True table: `0.164***` but your generated stars show `0.166**` (p≈0.00147). That would normally be `***` if the threshold is p<.001. So either:
   - your p-value differs because the sample differs (likely), and/or
   - you applied star cutoffs incorrectly.
   
   **Fix:**
   - First fix the sample (N should be 503). Recompute the p-value.
   - Ensure star rules exactly match: * <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001 (you claim this, but your star assignment currently doesn’t align with the printed result because your p is > .001).

## 3) Variable-name mismatches / labeling problems

**Mismatch:** The true table uses descriptive names (“Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, “Political intolerance”). Your generated output uses internal names (`income_pc`, `prestg80`, `political_intolerance`). That’s not inherently wrong, but it is a mismatch relative to “as printed.”

**Fix:** Add a label map when printing:
- `educ` → Education  
- `income_pc` → Household income per capita  
- `prestg80` → Occupational prestige  
- `female` → Female  
- etc.

More important: confirm the variables *substantively correspond* to what the paper used (especially `prestg80` and the intolerance index).

---

## 4) Standard errors: every SE in the generated table is non-comparable
**Mismatch:** Since the true table has **no SEs**, **every SE you printed is a mismatch by definition** (not “wrong,” but not comparable).

**Fix options:**
- Remove SEs from the table output to match the true results presentation.
- Or obtain SEs from the same original model estimation used by the authors (same sample, same variable construction) and present them in an appendix, but don’t claim they match Table 1.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by the numbers (what your generated results would wrongly imply)

Because your **N is smaller** (especially Model 3) and your **R² is lower**, your generated write-up would tend to understate:
- the explained variance of the political intolerance model,
- the size of the age and southern effects in Model 3 (you estimate them much smaller),
- and it would incorrectly omit/lose the Hispanic coefficient entirely.

**Fix:** After correcting DV construction, intolerance scale construction, and race dummy coding (so `hispanic` estimates), rewrite interpretations using the corrected betas and the correct N and R² from the replicated table.

---

# Practical “make it match” checklist (in order)
1. **Rebuild DV exactly like the paper** (your “complete-case across all 18 items” is very likely the main reason Model 1 N is 758 instead of 787).
2. **Rebuild political intolerance index exactly like the paper** (your “complete on all 15 items” is likely why Model 3 N is 426 instead of 503).
3. **Fix Hispanic coding so it is estimable** (mutually exclusive race dummies; one omitted reference; verify variance).
4. **Standardize using the same procedure as the authors** (z-score approach and sample definition).
5. **Match table formatting** (print standardized betas only; remove SE rows; apply star thresholds after fixing the sample so p-values align).

If you share (a) the code used to build `num_genres_disliked` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) how `hispanic/black/other_race` are constructed, I can pinpoint the exact line-level cause of the NaNs and the N discrepancies.
