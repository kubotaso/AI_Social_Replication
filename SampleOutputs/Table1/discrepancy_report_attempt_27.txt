### 1) Fit statistics (R², adj. R², N): all three models mismatch

| Model | Item | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| 1 | N | 747 | 787 | Sample size differs | Use the same analytic sample as the paper (same year, same exclusions, same missing-data handling). Do **not** listwise-delete on variables not in Model 1. |
| 1 | R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | Understated fit | Re-run with the paper’s exact variable construction + weights (if any) + same sample. |
| 1 | Adj. R² | 0.0846 | 0.104 | Understated | Same as above. |
| 2 | N | 507 | 756 | Massive mismatch | Your Model 2 is being fit on a much smaller set—likely due to accidental listwise deletion on variables that shouldn’t be in Model 2 (e.g., political intolerance), or using a restricted sub-sample. Ensure Model 2 uses **only** Model 2 covariates for listwise deletion. |
| 2 | R² | 0.1387 | 0.151 | Slightly low | Align sample/weighting/coding. |
| 2 | Adj. R² | 0.1196 | 0.139 | Too low | Same. |
| 3 | N | 286 | 503 | Massive mismatch | You are almost certainly doing listwise deletion across *all variables including outcome + pol_intol*, and/or using a different missingness rule than the paper. The paper’s N=503 implies a different handling (possibly different variable availability, different construction, or less restrictive missingness). Replicate the paper’s inclusion rules exactly. |
| 3 | R² | 0.1486 | 0.169 | Understated | Align sample/weights/coding. |
| 3 | Adj. R² | 0.1112 | 0.148 | Much too low | Your N is far smaller; adj. R² drops accordingly. Fix N first. |

**Core problem:** your models are being estimated on inconsistent and overly reduced samples (507 and 286) relative to the paper (756 and 503). That alone will move coefficients, significance, and fit.

### 2) Variable names: mostly cosmetic, but one conceptual mismatch risk

- Outcome naming mismatch: paper outcome is **Number of Music Genres Disliked**; your output references `num_genres_disliked`. That’s fine **only if** it is constructed identically (range, top-coding, missing codes).
- Predictor naming differences (`educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, etc.) are fine if the coding matches.

**But:** Your missingness table includes `pol_intol` with **47% missing**, which strongly suggests your Model 3 N collapse to 286 is driven by listwise deletion on `pol_intol`. The paper’s Model 3 N=503 suggests either (a) their `pol_intol` has far less missing in their constructed analytic file, (b) they used different coding/imputation, or (c) they used a different intolerance measure with higher availability.

**Fix:** Verify you are using the exact same GSS items, coding, and “don’t know/refused/not asked” recodes as the paper. Confirm the **year filter (1993)** and whether the intolerance module was asked of a subsample; if so, the paper’s N should reflect that same subsample.

### 3) Coefficients (standardized β): mismatches by model and variable

Important: Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**, not unstandardized b. Your “Table1style” correctly prints beta-like values, so comparisons below focus on β.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | Too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | Slightly off |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | Slightly off |
| Constant (unstd.) | 10.638 | 10.920 | Off |
| R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | Off |
| N | 747 | 787 | Off |

**How to fix:** Use the correct N=787 sample for Model 1 (listwise delete only on education+income+prestige+outcome). Ensure any weighting/standardization method matches the paper.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | Too negative |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | Slightly off |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | Too negative |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | Close |
| Age | 0.103* | 0.140*** | **Major** (size + significance) |
| Black | 0.100 | 0.029 | **Major** |
| Hispanic | 0.074 | -0.029 | **Sign flip** |
| Other race | -0.027 | 0.005 | Sign flip / mismatch |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.087 | 0.059 | Too large |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | Close |
| Southern | 0.061 | 0.097** | Too small + wrong sig |
| Constant | 8.675 | 8.507 | Off |
| R² | 0.139 | 0.151 | Off |
| N | 507 | 756 | **Huge** |

**How to fix (likely causes):**
1. **Wrong sample (biggest issue):** your N=507 vs 756 will change race/ethnicity composition and correlations, easily causing sign flips (Hispanic, Other race).
2. **Coding of race/ethnicity dummies:** The paper likely uses mutually exclusive race categories with a clear reference group (typically White non-Hispanic). Your variables `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` must be constructed to match that scheme. If Hispanic is not mutually exclusive with race in your coding, coefficients can flip.
3. **Age variable:** Your age effect is much smaller and barely significant; could be (a) age coded differently (e.g., centered/scaled), (b) sample restriction, (c) weights, or (d) you used `age_v` with different handling of missing/outliers than the paper.
4. **Southern:** paper has 0.097**; yours 0.061 (ns). Again points to sample mismatch and/or regional dummy coding.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | Similar size, **sig level differs** |
| Income pc | -0.052 | -0.009 | **Very large mismatch** |
| Prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | Some mismatch |
| Female | -0.127* | -0.095* | Too negative |
| Age | 0.091 | 0.110* | Too small, wrong sig |
| Black | 0.060 | 0.049 | Close |
| Hispanic | -0.030 | 0.031 | **Sign flip** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | Matches |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.036 | 0.066 | Too small |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | Matches |
| Southern | 0.068 | 0.121** | Too small + wrong sig |
| Political intolerance | 0.184** | 0.164*** | Too large, wrong sig |
| Constant | 7.999 | 6.516 | Off |
| R² | 0.149 | 0.169 | Off |
| N | 286 | 503 | **Huge** |

**How to fix (likely causes):**
1. **Sample mismatch due to intolerance missingness:** your N collapses to 286; the paper’s is 503. Fixing the analytic sample to match will likely bring income and intolerance effects closer to the paper.
2. **Income coefficient (β -0.052 vs -0.009):** this is not a small drift; it suggests either (a) different income construction/standardization (e.g., raw income vs per-capita vs logged), (b) wrong variable used, or (c) selection effects from the smaller sample.
3. **Political intolerance scaling:** You label it “0–15”; ensure the paper’s intolerance index is scaled identically (same items, same recoding, same summation, same range). A different scale will change β and significance.
4. **Hispanic sign flip again:** points to inconsistent ethnicity coding or sample restriction.

### 4) Standard errors: generated output reports them implicitly (via p), but the “true” Table 1 does not

- **Mismatch:** Your generated tables provide p-values and imply SEs from model estimation; the paper’s Table 1 **does not report SEs**, only standardized β and stars.
- **Fix:** If the goal is to match Table 1, **suppress SE/p reporting** and only present standardized β with the paper’s star cutoffs. If you must compute stars, they must be computed from *your* model’s SEs; but then stars won’t match unless the model/sample/coding match.

---

### 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Even where β is close, stars differ because your p-values differ—driven mainly by N differences and coefficient differences.

Key examples:
- **Model 2 Age:** Generated `0.103*` vs True `0.140***` → your model understates age effect and/or has much lower power (N=507 vs 756).
- **Model 2 Southern:** Generated ns vs True `0.097**` → again sample/coding.
- **Model 3 Political intolerance:** Generated `0.184**` vs True `0.164***` → could be sample, scale, or SE differences.

**Fix:** Stars will only align after you replicate:
1) same sample, 2) same variable coding, 3) same weighting and variance estimation, 4) same standardization procedure for β.

---

### 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true Table 1

1. **Reproduce the paper’s analytic Ns**
   - Model 1 should be N=787; Model 2 N=756; Model 3 N=503.
   - Implement **model-specific listwise deletion**: for each model, drop cases missing on outcome + that model’s predictors *only*.
   - Ensure you’re using **GSS 1993** only, and the same eligibility (e.g., adults, noninstitutional, etc.).

2. **Verify race/ethnicity dummy construction**
   - Make categories **mutually exclusive** and match the paper’s reference group (likely White non-Hispanic).
   - If Hispanic is treated as ethnicity overriding race in the paper, implement that rule; otherwise you’ll get sign flips.

3. **Verify income per capita construction**
   - Confirm it is truly *per capita* (household income / household size) and uses the same income measure, inflation handling, and missing recodes.
   - Confirm whether the paper standardizes after transformations (e.g., log) before computing β.

4. **Verify political intolerance index**
   - Confirm exact items, coding of “tolerate/intolerant” responses, and index range. Don’t rely on a label like “0–15”; validate min/max after recoding.
   - If your `pol_intol` has 47% missing but the paper achieves N=503, you are likely using a different variable or coding too many values as missing.

5. **Match standardized coefficient computation**
   - Paper’s β are standardized OLS coefficients. Compute β as OLS on z-scored variables (or compute post hoc standardized coefficients) in the same way across all predictors and the outcome.

6. **Match reporting format**
   - Drop SEs/p from the final Table 1 replication (since not reported).
   - Keep constants unstandardized.
   - Apply the same star thresholds (*, **, ***) and two-tailed tests.

If you share the exact code/commands used to construct `hispanic`, `inc_pc`, and `pol_intol`, plus the missing-data rule used to define each model’s estimation sample, I can pinpoint which single step is causing the N collapse and the Hispanic/sign and income mismatches.
