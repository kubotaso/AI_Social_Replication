Below is a line-by-line audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, covering **variable names, coefficients, fit statistics, sample sizes, and interpretation/formatting**—plus concrete fixes to make the generated analysis reproduce Table 1.

---

## 1) Coefficients: every mismatch (by model)

### Model 1 (SES)
| Term | True (Table 1) | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.322*** | **-0.332*** | coefficient too negative by ~0.010; stars differ only because coefficient differs |
| Household income per capita | -0.037 | -0.034 | coefficient differs |
| Occupational prestige | 0.016 | 0.029 | coefficient differs (notably) |
| Constant | 10.920 | 11.086 | constant differs |
| R² | 0.107 | 0.10877 | differs |
| Adj. R² | 0.104 | 0.10522 | differs |
| N | **787** | **758** | **major mismatch** (29 cases missing in generated) |

**How to fix**
- You are **not matching the same estimation sample** and/or **not using the same variable construction/standardization** as Table 1.
- Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients**, but your pipeline appears to compute standardized betas in `coefficients_long` while also producing a “table” that mixes outputs and (implicitly) adds SEs. The coefficient differences suggest either:
  1) different sample restrictions (very likely given N mismatch), and/or  
  2) different coding/cleaning of income/prestige/education than the PDF used.

Concrete steps:
1) **Recreate the exact N=787 sample** used in the PDF for Model 1. Your missingness table shows 893 nonmissing DV, but you drop down to 758. That implies **additional filtering** beyond the listed missingness (possibly year restriction, invalid codes, top-coding rules, or listwise deletion on variables not shown).
2) Ensure you are using the **same year/subsample** as the paper (your diagnostics show `N_year_1993=1606` which is a hint you filtered by year somewhere; ensure the paper did the same way).
3) Apply the paper’s **exact recodes** (e.g., income per capita definition, inflation adjustment, handling of 0/999/98/99 codes, prestige missing codes).
4) After matching sample + coding, compute standardized coefficients exactly as Table 1 does (see §4).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.260*** | coefficient differs |
| Income per capita | -0.054 | -0.051 | differs slightly |
| Occupational prestige | -0.006 | 0.007 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.090** | coefficient and **significance** mismatch |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.129*** | coefficient differs |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.004 | differs a lot |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | 0.034 | **sign mismatch** |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.001 | differs |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.059 | 0.065 | differs slightly |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.005 | differs |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.085* | coefficient and **significance** mismatch |
| Constant | 8.507 | 8.807 | differs |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.14546 | differs |
| Adj. R² | 0.139 | 0.13282 | differs |
| N | 756 | 756 | **matches** |

**How to fix**
- Since **N matches** here, the biggest problems are **variable coding/standardization** and possibly **weights/design** (if the PDF used weights and you didn’t).
- The **sign flips** for `prestg80` and `hispanic` strongly indicate coding differences:
  - `hispanic`: you likely coded a different reference category, mixed “Hispanic” with race categories, or used a different subset rule (e.g., excluding Hispanics from race dummies vs allowing overlap).
  - `prestg80`: prestige scale may be reversed, rescaled, or missing-value codes handled differently.

Concrete steps:
1) **Replicate dummy-variable construction exactly**:
   - Confirm Table 1’s race/ethnicity scheme. Many sociological tables use **mutually exclusive** categories (e.g., “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race” with “White non-Hispanic” omitted). Your construction may be **non-mutually-exclusive** (e.g., someone can be Black and Hispanic), which will change coefficients and signs.
2) Verify `female` coding (0/1; reference male) and that `age` is in years (not decades or centered).
3) Apply the same **standardization method** as Table 1 (see §4). Standardizing on a different sample (or after imputation/recode) changes coefficients and sometimes stars.
4) If the PDF used **survey weights**, re-run with weights; otherwise your betas and p-values will differ.

### Model 3 (Political Intolerance)
| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.155** | differs slightly |
| Income per capita | -0.009 | -0.016 | differs |
| Occupational prestige | -0.022 | -0.008 | differs a lot |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.116* | differs |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.060 | **size + significance mismatch** |
| Black | 0.049 | -0.009 | **sign mismatch** |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | 0.086 | differs |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.052 | close (OK-ish) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.066 | 0.051 | differs |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.017 | differs |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.091 | coefficient + **significance mismatch** |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.173*** | differs |
| Constant | 6.516 | 7.259 | differs |
| R² | 0.169 | 0.14311 | **large mismatch** |
| Adj. R² | 0.148 | 0.11821 | **large mismatch** |
| N | **503** | **426** | **major mismatch** |

**How to fix**
- The Model 3 issues are dominated by **sample definition for political intolerance** plus likely **scale construction**.
- Your diagnostics show `political_intolerance` ranges 0–15 and you have `polintol_nonmissing_strict15=491`, but the regression N is 426—so you are dropping **another 65 cases** beyond missingness on the listed covariates. Table 1 uses **503**, which is higher than your *nonmissing strict* count (491), implying Table 1 either:
  - uses a **different nonmissing rule** (e.g., allows partial items), and/or
  - uses a **different construction** of the intolerance scale, and/or
  - is not limited to your “year 1993 complete music_18” subset in the same way.

Concrete steps:
1) Rebuild `political_intolerance` **exactly as the paper/PDF**:
   - Same items, same coding direction, same handling of “don’t know/refused,” same aggregation rule (sum vs mean), same allowable missing items.
2) Match the **eligibility filter** used for Model 3 in the paper. Your pipeline seems anchored to “complete_music_18” and perhaps year=1993, which may not match the paper’s analytic sample for intolerance.
3) Confirm you are not accidentally applying **listwise deletion on additional intermediate variables** (e.g., created components, centered versions).
4) If Table 1 uses **weights**, apply them here too; R² differences can be substantial.

## 2) Variable name / label mismatches

### A. Education
- Generated term: `educ`
- True label: “Education”
- This is fine as an internal name, but your table prints **no row label**, just numbers (see §3). You need labels.

### B. Household income per capita
- Generated: `income_pc`
- True: “Household income per capita”
- Likely OK name-wise, but **construction may differ** (household vs family, per capita definition, inflation adjustment, trimming).

### C. Occupational prestige
- Generated: `prestg80`
- True: “Occupational prestige”
- Name ok, but coefficients suggest **scale/coding mismatch**.

### D. Race/ethnicity dummies
- Generated: `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`
- True: “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race”
- The big sign mismatch for Hispanic (Model 2) and Black (Model 3) strongly suggests the **dummy definitions/reference group are not the same** as Table 1.

### E. Political intolerance
- Generated: `political_intolerance`
- True: “Political intolerance”
- Name ok, but scale and missingness rules appear not aligned (N mismatch).

---

## 3) Standard errors: generated output is structurally inconsistent with “True Results”

**True Results statement:** Table 1 “does not print standard errors.”

**Generated `table1_style`:** It shows a second line under each coefficient that looks like an SE row (e.g., under -0.332*** there is -0.034, etc.). But in `coefficients_long`, the `cell` column contains only the coefficient with stars, and no SEs are provided.

So there are two problems:
1) **Those second-line numbers are not true SEs** (and they are not even formatted like SEs; some are negative, which SEs cannot be). They appear to be *other coefficients being printed without labels* due to a formatting bug.
2) The table is **missing variable names entirely**, making it impossible to interpret.

**How to fix**
- Fix the table-building code so each row is tied to a named term.
- If you want to match Table 1, **do not display SEs at all**. Display only standardized coefficients and stars.
- If you still want SEs for your own appendix, compute and display them correctly in separate parentheses rows; but they won’t be comparable to Table 1.

---

## 4) Standardization mismatch (core methodological discrepancy)

**True:** “Standardized OLS coefficients (as printed).”

**Generated:** You report `beta` values in `coefficients_long` that match the displayed coefficients closely, suggesting you did standardize. However, standardization can differ by:
- whether you standardize **X only** vs **both X and Y**,
- whether standardization is done using **sample SD** (N-1) vs population SD,
- whether you standardize on the **full sample** vs **model-specific complete-case sample**,
- whether you apply **weights** in computing SDs and/or estimation.

Any of these will shift coefficients enough to produce the observed discrepancies.

**How to fix**
- Identify how Table 1 defines “standardized coefficient.” In most sociology tables it is:
  - either **beta from regression on z-scored variables** (both DV and IVs standardized), or
  - beta computed as \( b \cdot \frac{s_x}{s_y} \) from unstandardized regression.
- Then implement exactly that **on the exact analytic sample for each model** (and with weights if used).

---

## 5) Fit statistics and constants mismatches

### R² / Adj. R²
- Model 2: close but not identical.
- Model 3: far off (0.169 true vs 0.143 generated).
These will not match until:
- you match the **same sample**, and
- you match **weights/specification** and **variable construction** (especially political intolerance and race/ethnicity).

### Constant
If coefficients are standardized, constants are usually from an unstandardized model, or the table mixes reporting (Table 1 prints a constant despite “standardized coefficients”). Your constants differ in all models.

**How to fix**
- Confirm whether Table 1’s “Constant” is from:
  1) the **unstandardized** regression with raw DV, or  
  2) the standardized regression (in which case constant should be ~0 if DV is standardized).
Given Table 1 constants are large (10.920, 8.507, 6.516), they are almost surely **unstandardized intercepts** while coefficients are standardized betas.
- So you must replicate this mixed reporting:
  - run unstandardized OLS to get the intercept (and R²),
  - compute standardized betas separately (or via a standardized regression) but keep the **intercept from the raw-scale model** if that’s what the paper did.

## 6) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Examples:
- Model 2 `female`: true is * (p<.05), generated is ** (p<.01).
- Model 2 `southern`: true is **, generated is *.
- Model 3 `age`: true is *; generated is not significant.

**How to fix**
- Once you match **sample + coding + weights + standardization**, p-values will change.
- Also confirm Table 1’s star cutoffs are the usual two-tailed. Your generated p-values appear two-tailed; the mismatch is driven by coefficient/SE differences from the above issues.

---

## 7) Sample size (N) mismatches: the most consequential discrepancies

- Model 1: **787 (true) vs 758 (generated)**
- Model 3: **503 (true) vs 426 (generated)**

These alone guarantee you will not match coefficients or R².

**How to fix**
1) Reconstruct the paper’s **exact inclusion criteria** for each model.
2) Do **model-specific listwise deletion** only on variables actually in that model (and using the paper’s missing rules).
3) Ensure you are not inadvertently restricting to “complete music_18” when the paper uses a different DV completeness rule, or a different year subset, etc.

---

## Summary of required fixes (to make generated match Table 1)

1) **Repair table formatting**: print variable names; remove the bogus second line (it is not SEs).
2) **Match analytic samples**: achieve N=787 (M1), N=756 (M2 already ok), N=503 (M3).
3) **Match variable coding**:
   - race/ethnicity dummies must match Table 1’s mutually exclusive scheme and reference group,
   - prestige/income/education recodes must match,
   - political intolerance scale construction and missing handling must match.
4) **Match standardization method** used for “standardized coefficients,” and confirm whether constants are from unstandardized models.
5) If applicable, **apply survey weights/design** consistent with the paper.

If you share (a) the code used to build the race/ethnicity variables and political intolerance scale, and (b) the exact sample restriction steps, I can pinpoint the precise source of the N drops (758 vs 787; 426 vs 503) and the sign flips (Hispanic, Black, prestige).
