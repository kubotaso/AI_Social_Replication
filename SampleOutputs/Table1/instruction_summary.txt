## Mapping of Table 1 analysis variables to GSS 1993 data fields (per attached documentation)

### Data source / sample restriction
- **Survey year (GSS 1993)** → `YEAR`  
  - Use **`YEAR == 1993`** to define the study year.
- **Respondent identifier** (if needed for joins/merges) → `ID`

---

## Dependent variable (DV): “Musical exclusiveness” = count of genres disliked (0–18)

### Underlying 18 music-genre rating items (5-point like/dislike + “don’t know” as missing)
Create the DV from the following fields (all are coded: 1=like very much … 5=dislike very much; NA codes include “don’t know” etc.):

1. Big band/swing → `BIGBAND`  
2. Bluegrass → `BLUGRASS`  
3. Country/Western → `COUNTRY`  
4. Blues/R&B → `BLUES`  
5. Broadway musicals/show tunes → `MUSICALS`  
6. Classical → `CLASSICL`  
7. Folk → `FOLK`  
8. Gospel → `GOSPEL`  
9. Jazz → `JAZZ`  
10. Latin/Mariachi/Salsa → `LATIN`  
11. Mood/easy listening → `MOODEASY`  
12. New age/space music → `NEWAGE`  
13. Opera → `OPERA`  
14. Rap → `RAP`  
15. Reggae → `REGGAE`  
16. Contemporary pop/rock → `CONROCK`  
17. Oldies rock → `OLDIES`  
18. Heavy metal → `HVYMETAL`

### DV construction rule (as described in analysis summary)
- For each of the 18 items, define **“disliked” indicator**:
  - `1` if response is **4 (“dislike it”)** or **5 (“dislike very much”)**
  - `0` if response is **1, 2, or 3**
  - **Missing** if item is any of the GSS NA codes (including “don’t know / not available / refused / etc.”)
- **Musical exclusiveness (count)** = sum of the 18 “disliked” indicators.
- **Listwise requirement for DV**: if respondent is missing on **any** of the 18 music items, set DV to missing / drop from analysis (this matches “respondents with any missing on the 18 items are dropped”).

## Independent variables (IVs) / covariates in Table 1

### SES predictors (Model 1; also included in Models 2–3)

1. **Education (years)** → `EDUC`  
   - Use numeric years as coded in `EDUC`; treat GSS NA codes as missing.

2. **Household income per capita** → derived from `INCOME` (or `REALINC`) and `HOMPOP`  
   - **Household size** → `HOMPOP` (number of persons in household)
   - **Family income** (categorical bands) → `INCOME`
   - **Family income in constant dollars** → `REALINC` (available in file; constant-dollar income series)
   - Construct the analysis variable as:
     - **Per-capita income** = (family income measure) / `HOMPOP`
     - In practice for replication, map “household income per capita” to **`REALINC / HOMPOP`** when `REALINC` is available; otherwise use an `INCOME`-based numeric conversion divided by `HOMPOP`.
   - Treat NA codes in either component as missing (and therefore missing on the derived measure).

3. **Occupational prestige** → `PRESTG80`  
   - Use the 1980-based occupational prestige score; treat NA codes as missing.

---

### Demographic / group identity controls (added in Model 2; retained in Model 3)

4. **Female (dummy)** → `SEX`  
   - Recode: `female = 1` if `SEX == 2`; `female = 0` if `SEX == 1`; NA codes to missing.

5. **Age (years)** → `AGE`  
   - Use numeric `AGE`; treat NA codes as missing (note top-code label 89 = “89 or older” is retained as 89).

6–8. **Race/ethnicity dummies**
- **Black (dummy)** → `RACE`
  - `black = 1` if `RACE == 2`, else `0` for other non-missing values.
- **Other race (dummy)** → `RACE`
  - `otherrace = 1` if `RACE == 3`, else `0`.
- **Reference race category (implied)**: White → `RACE == 1` (and non-missing), with the other race dummies set to 0.

- **Hispanic (dummy)** → **not present in the attached documentation excerpt**  
  - The analysis summary requires a Hispanic indicator, but no field such as `HISPANIC`, `HISpanic origin`, or similar is included in the provided variable list. If your full codebook includes a Hispanic-origin variable, that is the field to map here.

9–10. **Religion dummies**
- **No religion (dummy)** → `RELIG`
  - `norelig = 1` if `RELIG == 4` (“none”), else `0` for other non-missing values.
- **Conservative Protestant (dummy)** → derived from `RELIG` and `DENOM`
  - Base field for broad affiliation: `RELIG` (Protestant/Catholic/Jewish/None/Other)
  - Denomination detail: `DENOM` (Baptist/Methodist/Lutheran/Presbyterian/Episcopal/Other/No denom)
  - Construct `cons_prot` as an indicator for Protestant respondents (`RELIG == 1`) whose denomination category meets your study’s “conservative Protestant” definition using `DENOM`. (This is the variable documentation-supported way to operationalize that label given the provided fields.)

11. **Southern (dummy)** → `REGION`
  - `south = 1` if `REGION == 3` (“south”), else `0` for other non-missing values.

---

## Political attitude predictor (added in Model 3)

12. **Political intolerance (0–15 count scale)** → derived from the 15 tolerance items in the documentation:

### Item set: 5 target groups × 3 civil-liberty contexts
For each item, code an “intolerant” response as 1, tolerant response as 0, NA as missing.

**Anti-religionist**
- Allow speech → `SPKATH` : intolerant = `2` (“not allowed”)
- Allow teach → `COLATH` : intolerant = `5` (“not allowed”)
- Allow book in library → `LIBATH` : intolerant = `1` (“remove”)

**Racist**
- Allow speech → `SPKRAC` : intolerant = `2`
- Allow teach → `COLRAC` : intolerant = `5`
- Allow book in library → `LIBRAC` : intolerant = `1`

**Communist**
- Allow speech → `SPKCOM` : intolerant = `2`
- Teach at college (fired) → `COLCOM` : intolerant = `4` (“yes, fired”)
- Allow book in library → `LIBCOM` : intolerant = `1`

**Military-rule advocate**
- Allow speech → `SPKMIL` : intolerant = `2`
- Allow teach → `COLMIL` : intolerant = `5`
- Allow book in library → `LIBMIL` : intolerant = `1`

**Homosexual**
- Allow speech → `SPKHOMO` : intolerant = `2`
- Allow teach → `COLHOMO` : intolerant = `5`
- Allow book in library → `LIBHOMO` : intolerant = `1`

### Scale construction
- **Political intolerance scale (0–15)** = sum of the 15 “intolerant” indicators above.
- Treat GSS NA codes as missing at the item level; apply the analysis rule your replication uses for scale missingness (the analysis summary indicates the battery is asked of ~2/3 sample, producing smaller N in Model 3; operationally, respondents not asked will have missing on these fields and will drop from Model 3 via listwise deletion).

## Model membership (Table 1)
- **Model 1 (SES Model)** uses:  
  - DV = musical exclusiveness (constructed)  
  - IVs = `EDUC`, per-capita income (`REALINC/HOMPOP`), `PRESTG80`
- **Model 2 (Demographic Model)** adds:  
  - `SEX` (female dummy), `AGE`, race dummies from `RACE`, Hispanic dummy (field not in excerpt), religion dummies from `RELIG`/`DENOM`, and `REGION` (South dummy)
- **Model 3 (Political Intolerance Model)** adds:  
  - Political intolerance scale from the 15 tolerance items (`SPK*`, `COL*`, `LIB*` as listed)

This mapping links each analysis construct in Table 1 directly to the documented GSS fields (and specifies the required recodes/derived measures) so the dataset can be prepared and the three OLS models can be run.
