Score: 57/100
============================================================

## 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches

### A. DV label mismatch
- **Generated:** “DV: Number of music genres disliked” and variable shown as `num_genres_disliked`.
- **True:** Same concept (“Number of music genres disliked”)—this is consistent substantively.
- **Fix:** None needed on the DV label, but ensure the constructed DV exactly matches the paper’s definition (e.g., count over the same list of genres, same missing-data rule). The large N/R² discrepancies (below) suggest the DV construction and/or listwise deletion rule may differ.

### B. Predictor naming differences (cosmetic but should align)
- **Generated term names:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`.
- **True Table 1 names:** Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Political intolerance.
- **Fix:** Relabel terms in the table output to match Table 1 exactly. This doesn’t change estimates, but it’s required for “matching.”

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only**. Your generated coefficients are close in some places, but many do not match.

### Model 1 (SES): mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332*** | -0.322*** | too negative (-0.010) |
| Income per capita | -0.034 | -0.037 | slightly less negative (+0.003) |
| Occupational prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | too positive (+0.013) |

**Fix:** This pattern (all three off) usually indicates you are not using the *exact same sample* and/or *exact same variable construction* as the paper (see Section 5 on N differences). Standardized betas are very sensitive to sample and coding differences.

### Model 2 (Demographic): mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.260*** | -0.246*** | too negative |
| Income per capita | -0.051 | -0.054 | slightly less negative |
| Occupational prestige | 0.007 | -0.006 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.090** | -0.083* | larger magnitude and **stars differ** |
| Age | 0.129*** | 0.140*** | too small |
| Black | 0.009 | 0.029 | too small |
| Hispanic | 0.026 | -0.029 | wrong sign |
| Other race | 0.001 | 0.005 | too small |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.065 | 0.059 | close |
| No religion | -0.005 | -0.012 | too small |
| Southern | 0.085* | 0.097** | too small and **stars differ** |

**Fix:** Wrong signs (prestige, Hispanic) strongly suggest **coding differences** (e.g., reversed coding, different reference category, or mis-specified dummy creation). See Section 6.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.155** | -0.151** | close |
| Income per capita | -0.016 | -0.009 | too negative |
| Occupational prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | too small (closer to 0) |
| Female | -0.116* | -0.095* | too negative |
| Age | 0.060 | 0.110* | far too small + **stars differ** |
| Black | -0.005 | 0.049 | wrong sign |
| Hispanic | 0.090 | 0.031 | too large |
| Other race | 0.052 | 0.053 | matches closely |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.051 | 0.066 | too small |
| No religion | 0.017 | 0.024 | slightly too small |
| Southern | 0.090 | 0.121** | too small + **stars differ** |
| Political intolerance | 0.172** | 0.164*** | slightly larger and **stars differ** |

**Fix:** Multiple sign flips (Black) + large attenuation (Age, Southern) again points to **sample mismatch** plus **coding/standardization mismatch**.

## 3) Standard errors: generated output is incompatible with the “true” table

### What’s wrong
- **Generated table1_style prints a second row under each coefficient that appears to be a standard error** (e.g., for education: `-0.332***` then `-0.034` beneath it).
- **True results:** “Table 1 … reports standardized coefficients only and does not print standard errors.”

So, as presented, your generated table cannot “match” Table 1 because it contains SEs that the paper table does not provide—and the SE numbers you print are not verifiable against the PDF Table 1.

### Fix options
1. **Remove standard errors entirely** from the displayed table to mirror Table 1 (best match).
2. If you must show uncertainty, **print standardized coefficients only** in the main table and move SEs to an appendix—*but then you are no longer matching Table 1*.

Also note: your “SE-like” lines are suspicious because they often look like plausible coefficients of other variables (e.g., Model 1 shows “-0.034” as the second-line under education, but that is also the income coefficient magnitude). This suggests a **formatting bug**: you may be accidentally printing the *next coefficient* (or another row) where the SE should go.

**Concrete formatting fix:** Ensure your table builder explicitly maps `(term -> estimate)` and `(term -> std.error)` from the model object, rather than relying on row order.

## 4) Interpretation / significance-star mismatches

Because Table 1 uses two-tailed thresholds (*, **, ***), stars should align if p-values align—yet they don’t:

### Examples
- **Model 2 female:** Generated ** (p=0.0088), True *.
- **Model 2 southern:** Generated * (p=0.016), True **.
- **Model 3 political intolerance:** Generated ** (p=0.0010), True ***.
- **Model 3 age:** Generated ns (p=0.223), True *.

### Fix
These are not “interpretation errors” per se—they are downstream of coefficient/sample/coding differences. Once you reproduce the same sample and coding, the stars should match.

But also verify you’re using:
- **Two-tailed tests** (the true table says two-tailed).
- Same **alpha cutoffs**: .05/.01/.001.
- Same **SE estimator** (classic OLS vs robust/cluster). If you used robust SEs but the paper used conventional OLS (or vice versa), stars will differ even if coefficients match.

## 5) Fit statistics and N: major mismatches (this is likely the main root cause)

### N mismatches
- **Model 1:** Generated N = **758** vs True N = **787** (off by 29)
- **Model 2:** Generated N = **756** vs True N = **756** (matches)
- **Model 3:** Generated N = **426** vs True N = **503** (off by 77)

### R² mismatches
- **Model 1:** 0.1088 vs 0.107 (close)
- **Model 2:** 0.1455 vs 0.151 (noticeable)
- **Model 3:** 0.1430 vs 0.169 (large)

### Constant mismatches (unstandardized)
- **Model 1:** 11.086 vs 10.920
- **Model 2:** 8.804 vs 8.507
- **Model 3:** 7.258 vs 6.516

### Fix
To match published standardized betas, you must reproduce **the exact estimation sample and variable definitions** used in the paper.

Concretely:
1. **Replicate the paper’s sample restriction.**  
   Your diagnostics show `N_year_1993 = 1606` and `N_complete_music_18 = 893`. The paper’s Model 1 uses **787**, not 758. That implies the paper is not using the same complete-case rule you applied for Model 1, or it uses different missing-value handling (e.g., allowing some missingness via mean imputation, or using different income/prestige sources).
2. **Use the same listwise deletion rule per model as the paper.**  
   - Your Model 2 N matches exactly, which suggests your demographic variables are close to theirs.
   - Your Model 3 N is far smaller because your `political_intolerance` has only **491 nonmissing**, and you end up with **426** complete cases. The paper has **503**, which is **larger than your nonmissing political intolerance (491)**—that is a red flag that you may be:
     - treating some valid values as missing (miscoding),
     - constructing the intolerance index incorrectly (dropping items too aggressively),
     - or applying “strict complete-case across items” when the paper uses a scale score computed with partial item completion.
3. **Match the paper’s scale construction for political intolerance.**  
   Your diagnostics show `polintol_strict_complete_case_items = 15`. If you required complete responses to all items, you will shrink N and change coefficients. Many papers compute scales if respondents answered, say, ≥k items (or use mean across answered items).
   - **Change rule:** compute political intolerance using the paper’s stated rule (e.g., average of available items, or require only a minimum number answered).
   - Recompute `political_intolerance` and re-estimate Model 3. This should move N toward 503 and likely increase R² toward 0.169.

## 6) Dummy/reference-category coding issues (driving sign flips)

Two places strongly suggest coding problems:

### A. Hispanic sign flips (Model 2)
- **Generated:** +0.026
- **True:** -0.029

This can happen if:
- the reference group differs (e.g., you used “white” as omitted but the paper used “non-black” or used a different ethnicity coding),
- Hispanic is not mutually exclusive with race in the source data (common in surveys), and the paper’s coding handled this differently.

**Fix:** Recreate race/ethnicity exactly as the paper did:
- Determine whether “Hispanic” is coded as an ethnicity that overrides race (often: classify Hispanic respondents as Hispanic regardless of race; then create race dummies among non-Hispanics).
- Ensure the omitted category is the same as Table 1 (almost certainly “White, non-Hispanic, non-Other race” as baseline).

### B. Black sign flips (Model 3)
- **Generated:** -0.005
- **True:** +0.049

Given Model 2 Black is also too small (0.009 vs 0.029), this again points to:
- misclassification,
- or to Model 3’s sample being very different (selection on intolerance nonmissing).

**Fix:** After fixing political intolerance missingness/sample construction, re-check race coding. Also verify that `black` is 1 for Black respondents (not “non-Black”).

---

## 7) Standardization procedure mismatch (critical because Table 1 is standardized betas)

Table 1’s coefficients are standardized. Your “coefficients_long” includes `beta_std`, but it matches your printed `cell` values, meaning you are already printing standardized betas.

However, standardized betas can differ depending on:
- whether you standardized **using the model sample** vs the full sample,
- whether you standardized **before** listwise deletion,
- whether you standardized the DV as well (typical beta uses SD(y) and SD(x) from estimation sample),
- how dummies are handled (standardizing 0/1 dummies is normal but must match paper).

**Fix:** Standardize exactly like the paper:
- Standardize using **the estimation sample for that model**.
- Confirm whether the paper standardized **all predictors including dummies** (likely yes if they say “standardized OLS coefficients”).
- Do not mix partially standardized outputs (e.g., `lm.beta`-style vs manual z-scoring) unless it replicates the paper.

---

## 8) Summary: what to change to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Remove SE rows from Table 1 output** (the published table has no SEs). Also fix the table-building bug that appears to be printing non-SE values as “SEs.”
2. **Reproduce the exact paper sample**:
   - Match year/subsample filters.
   - Match inclusion rules for DV.
   - Match missing-data handling (especially for political intolerance scale).
3. **Reconstruct political intolerance** per the paper (likely allow partial item response; don’t require strict completion of all 15 items unless the paper says so). This should move Model 3 N from 426 toward 503 and raise R².
4. **Recode race/ethnicity variables to match the paper’s mutually exclusive categories and reference group** (this should correct sign flips for Hispanic/Black and adjust magnitudes).
5. **Confirm standardization method** (within-model estimation sample SDs) so standardized betas line up.

If you paste the paper’s exact coding notes for (a) the DV construction and (b) the political intolerance scale rule, I can tell you precisely which of your diagnostics (“dv_strict_complete_case_items=18”, “polintol_strict_complete_case_items=15”, etc.) is inconsistent and how to rewrite the scoring to hit N=787 and N=503 exactly.
