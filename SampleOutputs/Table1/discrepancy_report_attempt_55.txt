## 1) Fit statistics: **n, R², adjusted R² all mismatch**

### Mismatches
- **Model 1 n**: Generated **747** vs True **787**
- **Model 2 n**: Generated **507** vs True **756**
- **Model 3 n**: Generated **286** vs True **503**

- **Model 1 R²/Adj R²**: Generated **0.088 / 0.085** vs True **0.107 / 0.104**
- **Model 2 R²/Adj R²**: Generated **0.138 / 0.119** vs True **0.151 / 0.139**
- **Model 3 R²/Adj R²**: Generated **0.148 / 0.114** vs True **0.169 / 0.148**

### Why this happened
Your estimation frames show extreme listwise deletion driven by missingness in **pol_intol** and **hispanic**:
- `pol_intol` ~47% missing → Model 3 collapses to **286**
- `hispanic` ~35% missing → and your Model 3 shows `Hispanic = NaN` (dropped due to collinearity/empty variation in the reduced sample)

But the “true” table’s sample sizes (787/756/503) imply the original authors used **different inclusion rules** (and/or different coding/missing-data handling) than your pipeline.

### Fix
To match the published table:
1. **Replicate the paper’s exact missing-data rules.** Common possibilities:
   - Use **pairwise deletion** for some descriptive steps but **listwise** per model with a specific missing-code scheme.
   - Recode GSS “DK/NA/not asked” to missing exactly as the authors did (GSS has multiple missing categories; treating some as valid or missing changes n dramatically).
2. **Do not drop observations via “hispanic” construction errors.**
   - Ensure `hispanic` is coded for all relevant cases (e.g., `HISPANIC` or `ETHNIC` based on the same year’s GSS coding), and that missing categories are handled consistently.
3. For Model 3 specifically: if the paper has **503** cases, you must reproduce whatever they did to avoid losing ~40%+ of the data to `pol_intol`:
   - Verify you are using the **same political intolerance scale**, built from the correct items and filters (often only asked of a subsample; authors may restrict to that module but not lose additional cases via other variables).
   - Ensure `pol_intol` is computed before dropping and that “not in universe” cases are treated the same way as in the paper.

## 2) Variable naming/identity issues (and one dropped variable)

### Mismatches
- Your models use outcome `num_genres_disliked`, which corresponds to the paper’s **Number of Music Genres Disliked** (fine), but the **key covariate** issue is:
- **Model 3: Hispanic is missing (NaN) and shown as “dropped hispanic”**, but the true table reports a coefficient for **Hispanic (β = 0.031)**.

### Fix
- Ensure **Hispanic is not perfectly collinear** with other race dummies and the intercept:
  - Use one reference category (e.g., White non-Hispanic) and include dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race **only**, not an additional “White” dummy.
  - Confirm Hispanic is not derived from race in a way that makes it redundant in your coding.
- Ensure Hispanic has **variation** in the estimation sample (your Model 3 sample may have zero Hispanics due to how missingness/subsetting was done).

---

## 3) Coefficients: standardized β in the table vs your mixed reporting (and many β values differ)

The “True Results” are **standardized coefficients (β)** (except constants). Your generated output includes both:
- `b` (unstandardized)
- `beta` (standardized)

Comparison should be **β-to-β** and **constant-to-constant**.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292** | **-0.322** | No |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | Close but not exact |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | No |
| Constant (unstd) | **10.638** | **10.920** | No |

**Fix:** Once the sample and coding match (n=787), re-estimate. Differences of this size strongly suggest **different analytic sample and/or different scaling/coding** (income transformation, prestige variable version, education coding).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.266 | -0.246 | No |
| Income pc | -0.054 | -0.054 | **Yes** (this one matches) |
| Prestige | -0.010 | -0.006 | No |
| Female | -0.089 | -0.083 | No |
| Age | 0.102 | 0.140 | No (big) |
| Black | 0.037 | 0.029 | No |
| Hispanic | -0.033 | -0.029 | No |
| Other race | **-0.027** | **0.005** | **No (sign flips)** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.083 | 0.059 | No |
| No religion | -0.018 | -0.012 | No |
| Southern | 0.060 | 0.097 | No |
| Constant (unstd) | 9.663 | 8.507 | No |

**Especially problematic:**
- **Other race sign flip** (generated negative, true slightly positive)
- **Age β** much smaller than true (0.102 vs 0.140)
- **Southern β** substantially smaller (0.060 vs 0.097)

**Fix:** These patterns again point to **different sample composition** (your n=507 vs 756) and possibly **different dummy coding**:
- Confirm “Other race” is coded the same as the paper (some papers treat “other” as including Asians/Native Americans; others exclude small categories or code race differently).
- Confirm `age_v` is age in years with proper top-coding/valid range identical to paper.
- Confirm `south` matches GSS “South” region coding the paper used.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157 | -0.151 | Close (but sig differs) |
| Income pc | -0.050 | -0.009 | **No (huge)** |
| Prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | No |
| Female | -0.126 | -0.095 | No |
| Age | 0.091 | 0.110 | No |
| Black | 0.085 | 0.049 | No |
| Hispanic | **(dropped/NaN)** | 0.031 | **No** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | **Yes** (matches) |
| Cons Protestant | 0.038 | 0.066 | No |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.024 | **Yes** |
| Southern | 0.068 | 0.121 | No |
| Political intolerance | 0.183 | 0.164 | No |
| Constant (unstd) | 7.635 | 6.516 | No |

**The biggest red flag:** Income per capita β **-0.050** vs true **-0.009**. That is not a rounding issue; it’s almost certainly due to **different income definition/transformation and/or sample selection**.

**Fix:**
- Rebuild income exactly as the paper did (e.g., equivalized? logged? trimmed/winsorized? constant dollars?).
- Verify that “per capita” is actually what the paper used. If the paper used household income (not per capita), your `inc_pc` will not match.
- Ensure the same cases are included (n must be 503).

---

## 4) Standard errors: your output reports SE implicitly via p-values; the paper’s Table 1 does not

### Mismatch
- Generated tables include **p-values and stars derived from them**, which is fine internally, but you also present this as if comparable to the paper. The paper’s Table 1 does **not** report SEs (and your “True Results” explicitly mark SE as not reported).

### Fix
- To match Table 1, output **only standardized β with stars** (and unstandardized constant), and **suppress SE/p** in the final presentation.
- If you want to keep p-values for diagnostics, keep them in a separate appendix table.

---

## 5) Significance stars / interpretation mismatches

### Mismatches (examples)
- **Model 3 Political intolerance**: Generated **0.183** with **p=0.0039 (“**”)**; True is **0.164 (“***”)**.
- **Model 3 Education**: Generated “*” (p=0.025) vs True “**”.
- **Model 2 Age**: Generated “*” vs True “***”.
- **Model 2 Southern**: Generated not significant vs True “**”.

These are direct consequences of the wrong **n** and wrong **coefficients**.

### Fix
- Once sample/coding are corrected and coefficients align, stars will generally align automatically. Also confirm:
  - Two-tailed tests
  - Same alpha thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001)

---

## 6) Table construction error: `table1_combined` omits Model 2 & 3 variables
Your `table1_combined` shows only Constant + the three SES predictors, even though Model 2 and 3 include more variables.

### Fix
- When combining, do a **full outer join on term names** across all models so added predictors appear (with blanks where absent).
- Ensure consistent term labels across models (e.g., “Other race” vs “Other race ” etc.).

## What you need to change to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Recreate the paper’s analytic samples** (n=787/756/503) by matching:
   - exact variable coding
   - exact missing-value handling (including GSS special missing codes)
   - exact subsetting rules for the political intolerance items
2. **Fix Hispanic so it is estimable in Model 3** (not NaN/dropped):
   - correct dummy construction + ensure Hispanics exist in the Model 3 sample
3. **Verify income and prestige definitions** match the paper (this likely drives the big Model 3 income discrepancy and constant shifts).
4. **Report the same estimands** as Table 1:
   - standardized β for predictors
   - unstandardized constant
   - no SEs in the main table
5. **Fix the table merge** so Models 2 and 3 show all demographic/political variables.

If you paste your codebook mappings (which GSS variables you used for income, prestige, hispanic, and political intolerance) and the exact missing-code recodes, I can point to the most likely exact coding divergence causing each coefficient gap.
