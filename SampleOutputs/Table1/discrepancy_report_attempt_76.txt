### 1) Fit statistics and sample sizes (n, R², adj. R²): all three models mismatch

**Generated vs True**

- **Model 1**
  - n: **747** vs **787** (true)
  - R²: **0.088** vs **0.107**
  - adj. R²: **0.0846** vs **0.104**
- **Model 2**
  - n: **507** vs **756**
  - R²: **0.139** vs **0.151**
  - adj. R²: **0.1196** vs **0.139**
- **Model 3**
  - n: **286** vs **503**
  - R²: **0.149** vs **0.169**
  - adj. R²: **0.111** vs **0.148**

**What this implies**
- Your generated analysis is being run on **much smaller analytic samples**, especially Models 2–3, so coefficients and fit statistics cannot match the published table.

**How to fix**
1. **Replicate the paper’s exact sample construction**: same year (GSS 1993), same eligible respondents, same exclusions, same handling of “don’t know,” “refused,” and inapplicable codes.
2. **Match the paper’s missing-data approach**. Your “missingness” table shows very high missingness in `pol_intol` and the DV. The paper’s n’s (787/756/503) suggest they either:
   - used different source variables with less missingness,
   - recoded missingness differently (e.g., constructed indices using partial information),
   - or used a different rule than strict listwise deletion.
3. Ensure your models use **the same cases across the same predictors** as in the paper. With listwise deletion, Model 2 should be ≤ Model 1 and Model 3 should be ≤ Model 2 (that part holds), but your drops (787→507→286) are far larger than the paper’s (787→756→503). That’s a strong sign your variable coding is not aligned.

### 2) Variable naming / coding problems (especially “Hispanic”)

**Mismatch**
- In the generated sample profile, `hispanic` has a mean around **0.917** in Models 2 and 3.
  - That would mean **~92% Hispanic**, which is not plausible for GSS 1993 and also inconsistent with typical coding.
- Yet the regression output includes “Hispanic” with a coefficient, implying it’s treated as a 0/1 indicator.

**Likely cause**
- The variable is probably coded **inversely** (e.g., 1 = not Hispanic, 0 = Hispanic), or it’s a multi-category code that wasn’t properly recoded to 0/1.

**How to fix**
- Verify the underlying GSS codebook and recode explicitly:
  - e.g., `hispanic = 1 if respondent is Hispanic else 0`
  - set DK/Refused to missing, not to 0 or 1
- After recoding, the mean should be a **small proportion**, not 0.92.

### 3) Coefficients (standardized β): many mismatches, including sign reversals

The true table reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except the constant). Your generated “Table1style” uses β as well, so that’s the correct metric to compare—but values don’t match.

#### Model 1 (SES)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | magnitude too small |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | close (minor) |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | close (minor) |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | wrong |
| R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | wrong |

**Fix**
- Once you match **sample (n=787)** and coding, education and constant should move toward the published values. The current deviation is consistent with using a different subset and/or different DV construction.

#### Model 2 (Demographic): several substantive mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | close |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | close-ish |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close |
| **Age** | **0.103***? (only *) | **0.140*** | too small + wrong sig level |
| **Black** | **0.100** | **0.029** | much too large |
| **Hispanic** | **0.074** | **-0.029** | **sign wrong** |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **0.005** | sign wrong |
| Cons Prot | 0.087 | 0.059 | too large |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | close |
| **Southern** | **0.061** | **0.097** | too small + wrong sig (true ** ) |
| Constant | 8.675 | 8.507 | wrong |

**Fix**
- The **sign errors** (Hispanic, Other race) strongly indicate **dummy-variable construction differs** from the paper:
  1. Ensure the **reference category** for race/ethnicity matches the paper (usually “White, non-Hispanic” as reference, with separate dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other).
  2. Ensure Hispanic is **not simultaneously encoded inside race** in a conflicting way.
  3. Confirm “Other race” definition matches the paper.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance): big mismatches and significance errors
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | sig too weak |
| **Income pc** | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | huge mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | modest |
| Female | -0.127* | -0.095* | too negative |
| **Age** | **0.091 (ns)** | **0.110*** | too small + wrong sig |
| Black | 0.060 | 0.049 | close |
| **Hispanic** | **-0.030** | **0.031** | sign wrong |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| Cons Prot | 0.036 | 0.066 | too small |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | matches |
| **Southern** | **0.068 (ns)** | **0.121** | too small + wrong sig |
| **Political intolerance** | **0.184** | **0.164*** | too big and sig weaker (** vs ***) |
| Constant | 7.999 | 6.516 | wrong |
| R² | 0.149 | 0.169 | wrong |

**Fix**
- The **income β** being -0.052 instead of -0.009 suggests your income variable (`inc_pc`) is not constructed the same way (or is heavily affected by selection into the small n=286 sample).
  - Check whether the paper uses a **different income measure**, different scaling, top-coding handling, or a different per-capita transformation.
- Political intolerance mismatch + n mismatch:
  - Your `pol_intol` has **47% missingness**; the paper still has n=503 in Model 3. You likely used a political intolerance measure with far more missingness than the one used in the paper, or you treated valid codes as missing.

### 4) Standard errors and p-values: interpretation mismatch with the “True Results” table

**Mismatch**
- Your generated output reports **b, SE (implicitly via p), and p-values**.
- The true table explicitly says: **Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β) and significance stars; SE not reported.**

**Why this is a problem**
- You’re comparing (and potentially interpreting) **inferential results** from your own regression output to a table that **does not display SEs** and may have used slightly different rounding/threshold conventions.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to “match Table 1,” then your reporting layer should:
  1. output **standardized β** (as you do),
  2. output **stars based on p-values**, but
  3. **not claim the paper’s SEs** (since they’re not provided).
- Also ensure your significance thresholds match exactly (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001). Your Model 3 “Political intolerance” is **p=0.003818** which should be ** (p<.01)**, but the true table shows ***. That discrepancy could be from:
  - sample/coding differences (most likely), or
  - the paper using different df due to weights/design effects (less likely), or
  - different model/spec.

### 5) Constants: all three models’ intercepts are off

- Model 1 constant: 10.638 vs 10.920
- Model 2 constant: 8.675 vs 8.507
- Model 3 constant: 7.999 vs 6.516 (largest gap)

**Fix**
- Intercepts are extremely sensitive to:
  - sample differences,
  - centering/standardization choices (especially if any predictors were centered in the paper),
  - different coding of 0/1 dummies and reference categories,
  - different DV construction.
- To match: verify DV coding, make sure only β are standardized (not the constant), and match the sample and dummy references.

## Checklist to make the generated analysis match the true Table 1

1. **Use the same DV**: “Number of Music Genres Disliked” constructed exactly as the paper did (same items, same counting rule, same missing handling).
2. **Rebuild the race/ethnicity dummies**, ensuring:
   - White (non-Hispanic) is the reference,
   - Hispanic is correctly coded (mean should be small),
   - “Other race” matches the paper’s definition.
3. **Reconstruct income per capita** exactly (units, top-codes, transformations, missing codes).
4. **Use the same political intolerance scale** (0–15) and confirm why your `pol_intol` is ~47% missing; fix recodes so valid answers aren’t dropped.
5. **Match the sample sizes** (787 / 756 / 503). Don’t proceed to coefficient comparisons until n matches.
6. **Report standardized β with stars** (and optionally keep your SE/p in an appendix), because the target table is β-only.

If you share the codebook mappings you used for `hispanic`, `inc_pc`, and `pol_intol` (including missing-value recodes), I can pinpoint the exact recode causing the sign flips and the massive n loss.
