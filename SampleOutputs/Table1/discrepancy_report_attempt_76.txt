Score: 20/100
============================================================

### 0) Core reason everything is off
Your **Generated Results are unstandardized OLS coefficients with standard errors**, estimated on a **different analytic sample**, while the **True Results table reports standardized coefficients (betas) only**, with **different Ns and fit statistics**. Because of that, almost every coefficient magnitude, the intercept, R², Adj. R², N, and several significance stars will not match.

To make the generated analysis match the “True Results,” you must:
1) compute **standardized coefficients** exactly as the paper did,  
2) use the **same case-selection / missing-data rules**, and  
3) ensure **variable coding and scaling** matches (especially DV construction and age).

## 1) Variable-name mismatches (and how to fix)

These are mostly naming, but naming often hides *coding* differences.

### SES model variables
- **Generated:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`
- **True (Table 1 labels):** Education; Household income per capita; Occupational prestige

**Fix:** Naming is fine if the underlying measures match, but verify:
- `income_pc` really is *household income per capita* (household income divided by household size) in the same units as the original study.
- `prestg80` is the same prestige scale and handling (e.g., missing, top-coding).

### Demographic model variables
- **Generated:** `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`
- **True labels:** Female; Age; Black; Hispanic; Other race; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern

**Potential mismatch hidden in construction:**
- Your `hispanic_rule` says: “if ETHNIC exists and ==1 then Hispanic=1 else 0; avoids listwise loss…”. That is a very specific rule and may not match the paper’s coding (and can change Ns and coefficients).

**Fix:** replicate the paper’s race/ethnicity coding exactly (often mutually exclusive categories with White omitted). Ensure:
- reference group matches (usually White, non-Hispanic, non-Other).
- Hispanic may be treated as ethnicity crossing race in some datasets; the paper likely forces mutually exclusive categories.

### Political intolerance
- **Generated:** `political_intolerance` built from “strict complete-case across 15 items; sum intolerance indicators (0..15)”
- **True:** “Political intolerance” (standardized coefficient reported)

**Fix:** verify the *exact* items, coding direction, and missing-data rule used in the paper. Your rule “complete-case across 15 items” is likely stricter than theirs (your N collapses a lot).

---

## 2) Sample size (N) mismatches (major)

| Model | Generated N | True N | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| SES | 748 | 787 | -39 |
| Demographic | 702 | 756 | -54 |
| Political intolerance | 396 | 503 | -107 |

**Fix (most important):** Your listwise deletion is too aggressive somewhere and/or your DV/intolerance construction differs.

Specific suspects from your diagnostics:
- DV: “**strict complete-case across 18 music items**; dislike=4/5; sum to 0–18” with `N_complete_music_18 = 893` (so DV itself isn’t causing the N drop below 893).
- Predictors missingness (Model 1): `educ` missing 59, `income_pc` missing 72, `prestg80` missing 33. A pure listwise delete from 893 would yield about your 748, but the paper reports 787—meaning **they retained more cases**, likely by:
  - using **less strict missing handling** for income/prestige (e.g., imputation, different source variable, or allowing “missing” category), or
  - using a **different starting sample** than your 893 “DV complete”.

For Model 3, the big problem is:
- `political_intolerance` missing **402** (nonmissing 491) and then your final N becomes 396 after adding other covariates.
- Paper’s N is 503, which is **greater than your nonmissing intolerance count (491)**—this is a red flag that your intolerance variable is not constructed the same way (or you’re applying “complete-case across 15 items” while they allow partial completion or use fewer items).

**Concrete fixes**
1) Reconstruct political intolerance exactly as in the paper (same items; same missing rule). Common alternatives:
   - mean of answered items (requires at least k items answered),
   - scale score with prorating,
   - factor score,
   - fewer than 15 indicators.
2) Do not impose “complete-case across all intolerance items” unless the paper explicitly does.
3) Confirm you are using the same survey year and inclusion restrictions as the paper for Table 1.

## 3) Coefficients: standardized vs unstandardized (universal mismatch)

### Education example (Model 1)
- **Generated:** -1.076 (with SE shown)
- **True standardized beta:** -0.322

These are not supposed to match because one is unstandardized and one is standardized.

**Fix:** Report standardized coefficients (betas). In OLS, if you standardize all variables (including DV), the slope equals the standardized beta. Two equivalent approaches:

- **Approach A (recommended):** z-score DV and all predictors, run OLS without additional standardization later.
- **Approach B:** compute standardized beta from unstandardized slope:  
  \[
  \beta^{std}_j = b_j \times \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
  \]

Your notes say: “predictors z-scored within each model estimation sample; **DV unstandardized**.” That guarantees your slopes will not match the table of standardized betas.

**Concrete fix:** Standardize the DV too (within the model’s estimation sample), or compute betas via the SD conversion above.

---

## 4) Intercepts/constants (guaranteed mismatch)

- **Generated constants:** ~5.54, 5.58, 5.40
- **True constants:** 10.920, 8.507, 6.516

Reasons:
1) You standardized predictors (and not DV); that changes the intercept.
2) The paper’s constant corresponds to their original scaling and sample.
3) If the paper reports standardized coefficients, they may still print an unstandardized constant from the unstandardized model (common), but it will only match if your model specification and sample match theirs.

**Fix:** Once you match:
- sample selection,
- DV construction,
- predictor scaling,
the intercept should align. If you standardize DV too, the intercept should be ~0 (if predictors are centered), which would *not* match their printed constant—so you need to mimic their reporting convention:
- estimate model in original units,
- compute standardized betas separately for display,
- display constant from the unstandardized model.

---

## 5) Coefficient-by-coefficient sign/value/star mismatches (beyond standardization)

Even after accounting for standardization, several **inference/significance** patterns differ, indicating remaining problems in sample/coding.

### Demographic model examples (significance patterns differ)
- **Age**
  - Generated: 0.386** (p=.003) but in Model 3 it becomes non-sig (p=.344)
  - True: 0.140*** in Model 2, **0.110*** (actually printed 0.110*) in Model 3
  - Interpretation mismatch: your Model 3 says age is not significant; true table says it is (at least *).
  - **Fix:** sample and/or political intolerance construction is distorting Model 3; also ensure age scaling (years vs decades). If your `age` is in decades, unstandardized slope would inflate vs the paper’s.

- **Southern**
  - Generated Model 2: 0.244 (p=.057, no star)
  - True Model 2: 0.097** (significant)
  - Generated Model 3: 0.240 (p=.172, no star)
  - True Model 3: 0.121** (significant)
  - **Fix:** again points to mismatch in sample and/or coding of `southern` (region definition), and standardization/reporting.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated Model 2: 0.299* (significant)
  - True Model 2: 0.059 (not significant)
  - Generated Model 3: 0.251 (ns)
  - True Model 3: 0.066 (ns)
  - **Fix:** likely your religion dummy construction differs from theirs (denominator group; classification; whether Catholics are separate; etc.). If you coded “conservative_protestant” too broadly/narrowly, you can create spurious significance.

### Political intolerance coefficient
- Generated: 0.551** (p=.004)
- True: 0.164***  
Direction matches (positive), but magnitude and stars do not (and your N is far smaller).

**Fix:** replicate the intolerance scale, missingness, and compute standardized beta.

---

## 6) R² and Adjusted R² mismatches

| Model | Generated R² | True R² | Generated Adj R² | True Adj R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SES | 0.097 | 0.107 | 0.094 | 0.104 |
| Demo | 0.127 | 0.151 | 0.113 | 0.139 |
| PolInt | 0.126 | 0.169 | 0.098 | 0.148 |

**Fix:** R² is computed on the unstandardized DV; standardizing doesn’t change R² *if the sample/specification is the same*, so the persistent gaps mainly reflect **different N/case selection and/or different variable construction**.

---

## 7) Interpretation mismatches (what your generated write-up would get wrong)

Even if you didn’t show narrative text, your generated output implies interpretations that would not match the true table:

1) **“Standardized OLS coefficients”**: your table is not standardized betas (you report raw b’s + SEs).  
   **Fix:** label correctly or compute standardized betas.

2) **Significance claims**: you would conclude in Model 2 that conservative Protestants significantly dislike more genres (it’s significant in your model), but the true table shows it’s not significant.  
   **Fix:** religion coding + sample.

3) **Age effect in Model 3**: you would likely say age is not associated once political intolerance is included; true results show age remains positive and significant (at least *).  
   **Fix:** intolerance scale + sample.

---

# What to change so the generated analysis matches the true Table 1

### Step 1: Match the analytic sample Ns
- Recreate the paper’s inclusion criteria (year, population restrictions).
- Recreate the DV exactly.
- Recreate political intolerance exactly, **especially missing-data handling** (your N for intolerance is incompatible with the paper’s Model 3 N).

### Step 2: Estimate unstandardized OLS for constant and R²
- Fit each model on the matched sample with variables in original units.

### Step 3: Compute standardized betas for display (Table 1 style)
- For each model, compute standardized beta for each predictor using:
  \[
  \beta^{std}_j = b_j \times \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
  \]
  using SDs from the **same estimation sample** as that model.
- Do **not** print SEs if you want to match the PDF table (since it doesn’t report them).

### Step 4: Ensure dummy coding/reference groups match
- Race/ethnicity categories must be mutually exclusive in the same way as the paper.
- Religion categories must replicate the paper’s definition of “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion.”
- Region definition for “Southern” must match (Census South vs other scheme).

If you paste (or describe) the paper’s exact coding rules for (a) the 18 music dislike items and (b) the intolerance items, I can pinpoint exactly where your construction diverges and why your Model 3 N can’t reach 503.
