Score: 33/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: **R², adjusted R², and N all mismatch**
**Generated vs. True**

- **Model 1**
  - N: **747** vs **787** (true)
  - R²: **0.088** vs **0.107**
  - Adj. R²: **0.085** vs **0.104**
- **Model 2**
  - N: **507** vs **756**
  - R²: **0.139** vs **0.151**
  - Adj. R²: **0.120** vs **0.139**
- **Model 3**
  - N: **286** vs **503**
  - R²: **0.149** vs **0.169**
  - Adj. R²: **0.111** vs **0.148**

**What this indicates**
- Your generated models are being estimated on **much smaller (and inconsistent) samples**, especially Models 2–3. That almost certainly comes from **listwise deletion driven by missingness** and/or **using different variable constructions** than the paper.

**How to fix**
- Reproduce the paper’s **exact sample definition** for each model (the paper’s N’s imply they did *not* drop nearly as many cases as your pipeline does).
- Implement the same missing-data handling as the paper. If the paper used:
  - **pairwise deletion**, you must match that (many software defaults differ).
  - **imputation** (common in some workflows), you must do that.
  - **special missing codes** (e.g., 8/9/98/99) recoded to NA, ensure you’re doing it identically.
- Ensure Model 3 is not restricted to only those with `pol_intol` observed **if the paper derived political intolerance differently** (see section 4).

### 2) Variable name / construct mismatches (and likely coding differences)
Even where names “look” similar, several constructs likely don’t match the paper’s operationalizations:

- Outcome:
  - Generated uses `num_genres_disliked` labeled “Number of Music Genres Disliked” (OK in name), but coefficient patterns and R²/N mismatches suggest the **dependent variable may not be identically coded** (range truncation, DK handling, etc.).

- Political intolerance:
  - Generated: `Political intolerance (0–15)` with **massive missingness** (47% missing).
  - True table has **N = 503** in Model 3 (not 286), so the paper’s intolerance index is either:
    - available for more respondents than your constructed `pol_intol`, or
    - computed from items you didn’t include, or
    - coded with different missing rules (e.g., allowing partial-item scoring).

**How to fix**
- Rebuild the political intolerance scale to match the paper:
  - Use the same items.
  - Use the same scoring range (0–15 is plausible, but your missingness suggests you require complete data across too many items).
  - Use the paper’s rule for partial missingness (e.g., mean of nonmissing items × number of items, or requiring only k of m items).
- Verify all demographic dummies match the paper:
  - Race categories must be mutually exclusive and based on the same “race” measure (some GSS years have multiple race variables or coding differences).
  - Religion groups (e.g., “Conservative Protestant”) require a specific classification scheme; if your `cons_prot` is a simplified proxy, it will not match.

### 3) Coefficients (standardized β) in “Table1style”: many mismatches
The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**, not unstandardized b. Your “Table1style” appears to report β (good), but several β values differ.

#### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | **Mismatch** |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | Close but **not exact** |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | **Mismatch** |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | **Mismatch** |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | **Mismatch** |
| N | **747** | **787** | **Mismatch** |

**Fix**
- Once the sample and variable coding match, these should align. Right now they can’t because you’re estimating on a different dataset slice.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.265*** | **-0.246*** | **Mismatch** |
| Income pc | **-0.051** | **-0.054** | **Mismatch** |
| Prestige | **-0.011** | **-0.006** | **Mismatch** |
| Female | **-0.085***? (shown -0.085*) | **-0.083***? (shown -0.083*) | Close, not exact |
| Age | **0.103***? (shown 0.103*) | **0.140*** | **Major mismatch** |
| Black | **0.100** | **0.029** | **Major mismatch** |
| Hispanic | **0.074** | **-0.029** | **Sign mismatch** |
| Other race | **-0.027** | **0.005** | **Sign mismatch** |
| Cons Prot | **0.087** | **0.059** | **Mismatch** |
| No religion | **-0.015** | **-0.012** | Close, not exact |
| Southern | **0.061** | **0.097** | **Mismatch (and sig)** |
| Constant | **8.675** | **8.507** | **Mismatch** |
| R² | **0.139** | **0.151** | **Mismatch** |
| N | **507** | **756** | **Huge mismatch** |

**Fix**
- The sign flips for **Hispanic** and **Other race**, and the large differences for **Age** and **Black**, strongly suggest **dummy coding or reference group differences** and/or **different underlying race variables**.
  - Confirm: race dummies should be (typically) White as reference, and Black/Hispanic/Other defined exactly as in paper.
  - Confirm Hispanic is not coded as a race dummy overlapping with Black/Other (mutual exclusivity matters).
- Also check **age scaling**: if you used `age_v` with top-coding or different treatment, β can shift, but not usually that drastically unless the sample differs (which it does).

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.155***? (shown -0.155*) | **-0.151** ** | Close but stars differ |
| Income pc | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | **Major mismatch** |
| Prestige | **-0.015** | **-0.022** | Mismatch |
| Female | **-0.127** | **-0.095** | Mismatch |
| Age | **0.091** | **0.110*** | Mismatch + sig |
| Black | **0.060** | **0.049** | Slight mismatch |
| Hispanic | **-0.030** | **0.031** | **Sign mismatch** |
| Other race | **0.053** | **0.053** | **Match** |
| Cons Prot | **0.036** | **0.066** | Mismatch |
| No religion | **0.023** | **0.024** | Essentially match |
| Southern | **0.068** | **0.121** | Major mismatch |
| Political intolerance | **0.184** ** | **0.164*** | Mismatch (size + stars) |
| Constant | **7.999** | **6.516** | Major mismatch |
| R² | **0.149** | **0.169** | Mismatch |
| N | **286** | **503** | Huge mismatch |

**Fix**
- Biggest red flags:
  1) **N collapse** (503 → 286) means you’re not using the same construction for political intolerance and/or you’re applying stricter complete-case rules.
  2) **Income β** being -0.052 vs -0.009 suggests either:
     - different income variable (e.g., logged, equivalized, capped),
     - different standardization procedure,
     - or again, a different analysis sample.
- Rebuild Model 3 with the correct intolerance scale and missing-data rule; then re-check income coding and standardization.

### 4) Standard errors: generated reports them implicitly (via p-values), but the “true” table does not
Your generated `model*_full` include p-values and therefore rely on SEs; the paper’s Table 1 does **not report SEs**, only stars.

**Mismatch**
- You cannot “match” SEs to Table 1 because they’re not in the true results.
- But you *can* match **β and stars** if you replicate the same model/sample.

**Fix**
- When reproducing Table 1, suppress SEs and p-values in the presentation and report:
  - standardized β,
  - constants (unstandardized),
  - stars based on the same thresholds.
- If you keep p-values for internal checking, ensure you use the same:
  - two-tailed tests (paper says two-tailed),
  - df assumptions (OLS usual),
  - robust vs conventional SEs (paper likely uses conventional unless stated otherwise).

---

### 5) Significance stars: several do not match the true table
Examples:
- Model 3 political intolerance: generated ** (p=.0038) but true is ***.
- Model 3 education: generated * but true is **.
- Model 2 age: generated * but true is ***.
- Model 2 southern: generated not significant, true **.

**Fix**
- Stars will fall into place only after you match:
  - sample (N),
  - variable definitions/coding,
  - and whether β’s are computed the same way.
- Also confirm you are using **standardized coefficients for stars** or (more commonly) stars from the underlying t-tests on unstandardized b (standardizing doesn’t change t if done by linear rescaling, but sample/coding issues do).

---

### 6) Constant terms: all three constants differ materially
- Model 1: 10.638 vs 10.920  
- Model 2: 8.675 vs 8.507  
- Model 3: 7.999 vs 6.516 (largest gap)

**Fix**
- Constants are sensitive to:
  - the estimation sample,
  - coding of 0/1 dummies,
  - any centering/standardization done incorrectly (do **not** standardize the dependent variable if you want the same intercept as the paper),
  - and whether you used weights.
- To match Table 1: compute standardized β for predictors (or compute β post-estimation), **but keep the model estimated on the unstandardized DV** and report the unstandardized intercept.

---

### 7) Missingness diagnostics: your missingness pattern is inconsistent with the paper’s N’s
Your missingness:
- `pol_intol` missing 47%
- `num_genres_disliked` missing 44%

If DV is missing for 44%, maximum N would be ~893 (you show nonmissing 893), which is plausible. But then Model 1 N should be near the paper’s 787 if you apply similar filters—yet you get 747, and Models 2–3 collapse much further.

**Fix**
- Confirm you are using the same **universe restrictions** as the paper (e.g., excluding nonrespondents, certain age ranges, etc.).
- Avoid unnecessary additional listwise deletion:
  - e.g., don’t require `hispanic` if it is only needed for creating a race dummy and can be coded as 0 when not Hispanic, depending on the paper’s rule.
- Recode “inapplicable / don’t know / refused” consistently with the paper.

---

## Summary of what to change so the generated analysis matches Table 1
1) **Match the sample per model** to the paper’s N (787 / 756 / 503). Your N’s are the biggest source of downstream mismatches.
2) **Reconstruct key variables exactly** (especially political intolerance; also race/ethnicity and conservative Protestant).
3) **Use the same missing-data rule** the paper used (your Model 3 is clearly over-deleting).
4) **Report standardized β (and stars) only**, with **unstandardized constants**, and don’t claim SE comparisons since Table 1 doesn’t provide SEs.
5) After (1)–(3), re-check **signs** for Hispanic/Other race and the **magnitude** of Age/Income effects—those are currently incompatible with the true table and point to coding differences.

If you share your code (variable construction + model estimation), I can pinpoint exactly where the sample drops from 756→507 and 503→286 and identify the specific recode or merge step causing the divergence.
