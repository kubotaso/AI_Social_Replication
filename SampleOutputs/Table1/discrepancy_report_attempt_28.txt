Score: 61/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches

**A. DV label mismatch**
- **Generated:** “DV: Number of music genres disliked (0–18)”
- **True:** “Number of music genres disliked” (scale not stated in Table 1)
- **Fix:** Either (i) remove “(0–18)” from the header, or (ii) verify from the codebook that the DV is truly 0–18 and explicitly note: “scale from data/codebook, not from Table 1.”

**B. Predictor naming differences (cosmetic but important for matching Table 1)**
Generated terms vs Table 1 names:
- `educ` → **Education**
- `income_pc` → **Household income per capita**
- `prestg80` → **Occupational prestige**
- `female` → **Female**
- `black` → **Black**
- `hispanic` → **Hispanic**
- `other_race` → **Other race**
- `conservative_protestant` → **Conservative Protestant**
- `no_religion` → **No religion**
- `southern` → **Southern**
- `political_intolerance` → **Political intolerance**

- **Fix:** Rename variables in the table output (a mapping layer) so printed names match Table 1 exactly. This won’t change estimates but is required to “match” the published table.

- **N:** 503 → **426** (off by -77)

### 3) Standard errors: the generated output is incompatible with the “true” table

- **True Results explicitly say:** Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only** and **does not print standard errors**.
- **Generated table1_style shows** a second line under each coefficient that looks like **SEs** (e.g., under -0.332*** it prints “-0.034”, which cannot be an SE because it’s negative and roughly the size of another coefficient).
- **Fix options (pick one):**
  1) **Remove SE rows entirely** to match Table 1.
  2) If you must show SEs, compute and print them correctly (positive), and clearly label them as SEs from your replication, not from Table 1. But then it will not “match” the printed table.

As-is, the second-line numbers in `table1_style` appear to be **misplaced coefficients from other rows**, not SEs. That’s a formatting/assembly bug.

---

### 4) Interpretation / reporting mismatches

**A. “Standardized coefficients” vs constants**
- Table 1 is standardized coefficients, but it still reports a **Constant** (unstandardized intercept in the original DV units).
- Your constants differ substantially in all models.
- **Fix:** Ensure you replicate the same:
  - DV coding (exact construction of “# genres disliked”)
  - predictor coding (especially binaries and reference groups)
  - sample restrictions / listwise deletion rules
  - weighting (if the article used survey weights)

**B. Significance stars don’t match multiple times**
Examples:
- Model 2: **female** (* in true, ** in generated)
- Model 2: **southern** (** in true, * in generated)
- Model 3: **age** (* in true, none in generated)
- Model 3: **southern** (** in true, none/* in generated)

- **Fix:** Stars must be based on the same p-value computation as the article:
  - same standardization approach,
  - same model (OLS),
  - same treatment of survey design (robust/clustered SEs vs conventional),
  - same sample (N must match),
  - same two-tailed thresholds (you used two-tailed in `coefficients_long`, but the underlying SEs/p-values may be from a different estimator than the paper).

---

### 5) The biggest cause of mismatches: the estimation samples (N) do not match Table 1

- **Model 1:** True N=787, Generated N=758  
- **Model 3:** True N=503, Generated N=426  
(Model 2 matches at 756.)

Your own diagnostics show heavy missingness on political intolerance:
- `political_intolerance` missing 402 / nonmissing 491 (you then end with N=426 because of additional listwise deletion across covariates)

**Fix to match Table 1 Ns:**
1) **Replicate the paper’s exact sample definition.** Common issues:
   - The paper may use **different year filters**, or include multiple years; you show `N_year_1993=1606` but Table 1’s N’s suggest a different inclusion pipeline.
   - The paper may **impute**, recode missing to 0, or use “missing” categories for some predictors rather than listwise deletion.
2) **Use the same missing-data handling as the article.**
   - If Table 1 uses listwise deletion, your N should match exactly—so you likely have at least one variable coded differently (creating extra missingness).
3) **Check your construction of political_intolerance.**
   - Your `polintol_nonmissing_strict15=491` hints you may be enforcing a “strict” rule (e.g., requiring 15 items present) that the paper did not use.
   - If the paper used a looser rule (e.g., mean of available items, or requiring fewer valid items), your N would increase toward 503.

---

### 6) Variable coding / reference-group mismatches (likely driving sign flips)

Several predictors flip signs compared to Table 1:
- Model 2: **Hispanic** true = -0.029, generated = +0.034
- Model 2: **Occupational prestige** true = -0.006, generated = +0.007 (minor but sign flip)
- Model 3: **Black** true = +0.049, generated = -0.009

Sign flips often indicate:
- different reference category coding (e.g., race dummies not mutually exclusive, or “other_race” constructed differently),
- different sample (composition changes can flip small coefficients),
- different standardization method (see next point).

**Fix:**
- Ensure race/ethnicity indicators are built exactly as in the paper:
  - Mutually exclusive categories with the same omitted/reference group (likely White non-Hispanic).
  - Hispanic often treated as ethnicity overriding race in some schemes; if you coded it differently, coefficients change and can flip sign.
- Verify binary coding direction (0/1) matches the article.

---

### 7) Standardization mismatch (your “beta_std” may not be what Table 1 used)

Table 1 says “standardized OLS coefficients.” That usually means **standardize X and Y (z-scores)** then run OLS (or equivalently compute beta = b * SDx/SDy).

If you standardized only X’s (or used sample-weighted SDs vs unweighted, or standardized before listwise deletion), betas will differ.

**Fix:**
- Standardize using the **same analytic sample as each model** (after applying the paper’s missing-data rules), and use the same weighting (if any).
- Confirm whether the paper standardized:
  - all predictors and DV, or
  - predictors only (less common when they explicitly say standardized coefficients).

---

### 8) Formatting/assembly bug in `table1_style` (SE row is wrong)

In `table1_style`, the second line under education in Model 1 is “-0.034” which equals the **income** coefficient shown later. That strongly suggests your table builder is printing **the next coefficient** where an SE should go.

**Fix:**
- In the table rendering code, ensure the SE column is actually pulling `std.error` (or equivalent) not the next row’s `beta_std`.
- Also ensure SEs are printed as **positive values in parentheses** if you keep them (e.g., `-0.332*** (0.041)`).

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches Table 1

1) **Match samples (N) first**: replicate the paper’s inclusion rules and missing-data handling (especially political intolerance construction). Until N matches, coefficients/stars won’t.
2) **Match coding** for race/ethnicity and any composite indices (political intolerance in particular).
3) **Match standardization procedure** (z-scoring X and Y within the model-specific analytic sample; apply weights if the paper did).
4) **Fix the table rendering**: remove SEs (to match Table 1) or compute/print them correctly; also rename variables to match Table 1 labels.
5) **Recompute p-values/stars** using the same SE estimator as the paper (conventional OLS vs robust vs survey-adjusted).

If you share the code (or at least how `political_intolerance` is built, what year/sample filters you used, and whether you used weights/robust SEs), I can point to the exact lines that are producing the N shortfalls and the sign flips.
