Score: 46/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: **n, R², adjusted R² all mismatch**

**Generated vs True**

- **Model 1**
  - **n:** 747 (gen) vs **787 (true)** → mismatch
  - **R²:** 0.0883 vs **0.107** → mismatch
  - **Adj R²:** 0.0846 vs **0.104** → mismatch
- **Model 2**
  - **n:** 507 vs **756** → mismatch (very large)
  - **R²:** 0.1387 vs **0.151** → mismatch
  - **Adj R²:** 0.1196 vs **0.139** → mismatch
- **Model 3**
  - **n:** 286 vs **503** → mismatch (huge)
  - **R²:** 0.1486 vs **0.169** → mismatch
  - **Adj R²:** 0.1112 vs **0.148** → mismatch

**Likely causes**
- You’re fitting models on **different analytic samples** than the paper (listwise deletion with additional missingness; possibly different recodes).
- Your **DV or key IVs may not match** the paper’s construction (especially political intolerance and/or “number of music genres disliked”).
- Your standardized coefficients appear to be computed on the estimation sample, but the **paper’s sample sizes suggest a different missing-data rule and/or different variable availability**.

**How to fix**
1. **Replicate the paper’s sample restrictions exactly** (GSS 1993 only, same age/race/other eligibility restrictions if any).
2. Ensure you’re using **the same DV**: “Number of Music Genres Disliked” (likely `num_genres_disliked`).
3. **Avoid unnecessary listwise deletion**:
   - Recreate the paper’s exact variable set and missing codes (GSS uses special missing codes like 8/9/98/99 etc.).
   - Recode those to `NA` correctly *before* modeling.
4. Confirm whether the paper used **weights** (common in GSS). If weights were used and you didn’t use them, R² and coefficients can differ. Apply the same weighting approach as the paper.

### 2) Variable-name/content mismatches (and implied coding differences)

Your “missingness” table uses:
- `pol_intol` (47% missing)
- `num_genres_disliked` (44% missing)

But your regression tables label:
- “Political intolerance” (OK conceptually), and DV is not explicitly named in the generated output.

**Red flag:** The paper’s n’s (787/756/503) are far larger than what your missingness implies would survive listwise deletion—especially Model 3, where you report **pol_intol missing ~47%**. Yet your Model 3 n is **286**, which is consistent with heavy listwise deletion, but **not** with the paper’s **503**.

**How to fix**
- Verify `pol_intol` is constructed the same way as the paper:
  - same items
  - same allowable nonresponse handling
  - same scaling and direction
- Verify `num_genres_disliked` is computed the same way (which genres, how “disliked” is defined, what to do with “don’t know,” etc.).
- Ensure all “missing” codes are harmonized to NA *and* that you match the paper’s decision rules (some papers treat certain responses as valid zeros rather than missing).

### 3) Coefficient mismatches: standardized betas (and constants) differ across all models

Table 1 in the true results reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except constants). Your generated “table1style” also appears to report **betas**, so those are the correct quantities to compare.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Gen β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292** | **-0.322** | ❌ |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | ❌ (close but not exact) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | ❌ |
| Constant (unstd) | **10.638** | **10.920** | ❌ |

**Fix**
- Once the **sample and coding** match, the betas will move toward the true ones. The constant mismatch strongly suggests the **DV distribution/sample differs**.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Term | Gen β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265 | **-0.246** | ❌ |
| Income pc | -0.051 | **-0.054** | ❌ |
| Prestige | -0.011 | **-0.006** | ❌ |
| Female | -0.085* | **-0.083***? (true is -0.083*) | ❌ (value close; star depends on p) |
| Age | **0.103***? (gen shows 0.103*) | **0.140*** | ❌ (big) |
| Black | **0.100** | **0.029** | ❌ (big) |
| Hispanic | **0.074** | **-0.029** | ❌ (sign flip) |
| Other race | **-0.027** | **0.005** | ❌ (sign flip) |
| Cons Prot | 0.087 | **0.059** | ❌ |
| No religion | -0.015 | **-0.012** | ❌ |
| Southern | **0.061** | **0.097** | ❌ |
| Constant | **8.675** | **8.507** | ❌ |

**Fix**
- The **Hispanic** and **Other race** sign flips are especially diagnostic of **different dummy coding / reference categories / sample composition**.
  - Confirm the paper’s race coding: usually White is the reference, with dummies for Black/Hispanic/Other. Make sure your `hispanic` indicator isn’t “Hispanic of any race” vs “Hispanic (race category)” inconsistently.
- Age effect being much smaller (0.103 vs 0.140) also suggests **different age variable** (e.g., `age` vs `age_v`, top-coding, restriction, or scaling).

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | Gen β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | **-0.151** | ❌ (close; star differs) |
| Income pc | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | ❌ (very large mismatch) |
| Prestige | -0.015 | **-0.022** | ❌ |
| Female | -0.127* | **-0.095***? (true -0.095*) | ❌ |
| Age | **0.091** | **0.110***? (true 0.110*) | ❌ |
| Black | 0.060 | **0.049** | ❌ |
| Hispanic | -0.030 | **0.031** | ❌ (sign flip) |
| Other race | 0.053 | **0.053** | ✅ (this one matches)
| Cons Prot | 0.036 | **0.066** | ❌ |
| No religion | 0.023 | **0.024** | ❌ (very close but not exact)
| Southern | 0.068 | **0.121** | ❌ |
| Political intolerance | **0.184** | **0.164** | ❌ |
| Constant | **7.999** | **6.516** | ❌ (large)

**Fix**
- The **income per capita β** is wildly off (-0.052 vs -0.009). That’s not just sampling noise; it screams **different scaling/definition of income**:
  - The paper’s “household income per capita” might be equivalized differently (household size, logged income, midpoint conversion from categories, etc.).
  - You may be using raw dollars/units that differ from the paper or failing to convert categorical income to continuous.
- The constant difference (7.999 vs 6.516) again indicates **DV differences** and/or **different centering/scaling choices**.

---

### 4) Standard errors: generated output includes SE implicitly (via p), but the “true” table has **no SE**

You were asked to compare SEs, but:
- **Generated results** provide p-values (implying SEs exist internally, though not printed).
- **True results**: Table 1 **does not report SEs**.

So any claim like “SE mismatches” cannot be assessed from the true table.

**Fix**
- Don’t report or compare SEs against Table 1.
- If you must compare SEs, you need the **original regression output** (or replicate from data) rather than Table 1.

---

### 5) Significance stars / interpretation mismatches

Because the coefficients and n differ, your p-values/stars differ too. Concrete mismatches:

- **Model 2 Age**
  - Gen: Age p=0.019 → `*`
  - True: Age `0.140***`
  - Interpretation mismatch: the paper finds a **stronger, highly significant positive** age association.
- **Model 2 Southern**
  - Gen: not significant (p=0.161)
  - True: `0.097**`
- **Model 3 Political intolerance**
  - Gen: `**` (p=0.0038)
  - True: `***` (0.164***)

**Fix**
- Once you match the paper’s **sample + coding + weights**, the p-values and star thresholds should align closely.
- Also ensure you’re using the **same two-tailed thresholds** as the paper (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001). Your generated stars appear consistent with that rule, so the root issue is upstream.

## Summary of “every mismatch” (checklist)

**Fit stats mismatches:** all models (n, R², adj R²).  
**Coefficient mismatches:** all coefficients in all models except “Other race” in Model 3.  
**Sign mismatches:** Hispanic (Model 2 & 3), Other race (Model 2), potentially others depending on coding.  
**Constants mismatches:** all models (especially Model 3).  
**SE comparison:** not possible because true table omits SEs.

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches the paper

1. **Rebuild variables to match the paper**
   - DV: exact construction of “number of music genres disliked”
   - `inc_pc`: replicate the paper’s per-capita income calculation (categorical-to-continuous conversion, household size divisor, any logs)
   - `pol_intol`: replicate item selection, scaling, and missing handling
   - Race/ethnicity dummies: confirm Hispanic definition and reference group

2. **Match missing-data handling**
   - Recode GSS special missings to NA correctly
   - Apply the same inclusion criteria the paper used to reach **n=787/756/503**
   - If the paper used pairwise methods or different composite-score rules, replicate them

3. **Match weighting/design if used**
   - Apply the same GSS weight variable and any design corrections (if the paper did)

4. **Ensure reported quantities are the same**
   - Table should report **standardized β** (not unstandardized b) for predictors
   - Constants remain unstandardized
   - Don’t report SEs if the benchmark table doesn’t include them

If you paste your code (variable construction + model formulas + any weights), I can point to the exact lines that are causing each mismatch and propose specific corrected code.
