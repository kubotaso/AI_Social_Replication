### 1) Model-level mismatches (N, R², constants, and whether models even ran)

#### **Model 1 (SES)**
- **N (cases) mismatch**
  - **Generated:** N = **758**
  - **True:** N = **787**
  - **Why it’s wrong:** Your Model 1 estimation sample drops far more observations than the published table. That means your listwise deletion / filtering is not aligned with the article’s (or you’re not using the same source sample/year subset).
  - **Fix:** Replicate the paper’s sample construction exactly:
    - Ensure you are using the same survey year(s) and the same inclusion criteria as the PDF.
    - Recode missing values correctly (GSS-style: 8/9/98/99, etc. often mean missing). If you mistakenly treated some of these codes as valid, or conversely treated valid values as missing, N will shift.
    - Use **listwise deletion only on the variables in that model** (you did that, but you likely created extra missingness through construction/merging or bad missing recodes).

- **R² / Adjusted R² mismatch**
  - **Generated:** R² = **0.10877**, Adj R² = **0.10522**
  - **True:** R² = **0.107**, Adj R² = **0.104**
  - **Assessment:** These are close, but still not matching. With a different N and slightly different coefficients, you shouldn’t expect identical R².
  - **Fix:** Once N and coefficients match (see below), R² should align.

- **Constant mismatch**
  - **Generated:** Constant ≈ **11.086**
  - **True:** Constant = **10.920**
  - **Why it’s wrong:** Different sample and/or different variable scaling/coding. Also, note the paper reports **standardized coefficients**, but **constants are unstandardized**, so they are very sensitive to sample differences.
  - **Fix:** Match sample + coding + whether any centering/standardization was applied to RHS variables before estimation. (Do **not** standardize predictors before fitting if you want the same constant as the paper; compute standardized betas after fitting.)

#### **Model 2 (Demographic)**
- **Model fails entirely**
  - **Generated:** N = **0** with note “No complete cases…”
  - **True:** N = **756**, with valid coefficients and fit stats.
  - **Primary cause in your diagnostics:** `hispanic` is **missing for all 893 cases** (“Not constructed… set to missing”), forcing N=0 under listwise deletion.
  - **Fix:** Properly construct **Hispanic** exactly as the paper does. Do not set it to missing when the field name differs.

#### **Model 3 (Political intolerance)**
- **Model fails entirely**
  - **Generated:** N = **0**
  - **True:** N = **503**
  - **Causes:**
    1) Same `hispanic` all-missing problem kills the model.
    2) `political_intolerance` has only **491 nonmissing** in your file, but the paper has **503** cases—so even after fixing Hispanic, you still need to align how intolerance is constructed and how missingness is defined/recoded.
  - **Fix:** Build the intolerance index correctly (same items, same coding, same missing-data rule), and fix Hispanic.

---

### 2) Variable-name / construction mismatches

#### **Hispanic**
- **Generated:** variable exists but is entirely missing; you state it was “not constructed (field not available…)”
- **True:** Hispanic is included and estimated in Models 2 & 3.
- **Fix options:**
  1) **Use the correct source variable** if it exists under another name (common in GSS-style datasets: `hispanic`, `hispan`, `ethnic`, `racehis`, etc.).
  2) If the dataset only has race categories, construct Hispanic from ethnicity items the same way the authors did (e.g., Hispanic ethnicity indicator separate from race).
  3) Validate coding: binary 1/0 with the same reference group as the paper (likely non-Hispanic).

#### **Political intolerance**
- **Generated:** `political_intolerance` exists (491 nonmissing) but model never runs.
- **True:** coefficient reported for Political intolerance = **0.164*** with N=503.
- **Fix:**
  - Recreate the scale/index exactly (items + aggregation).
  - Handle missing items the same way (e.g., allow index if at least k items present vs require all items present).
  - Ensure direction matches (higher = more intolerance). If reversed, the sign would flip.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

The “True Results” table reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas). Your `coefficients_long` reports `beta_std` for Model 1 only, which should be directly comparable.

#### Model 1 (SES) coefficient mismatches
| Term | Generated beta_std | True (SES model) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.3317*** | **-0.322*** | too negative |
| income_pc | **-0.0339** (ns) | **-0.037** (ns) | slightly off |
| prestg80 | **0.0294** (ns) | **0.016** (ns) | noticeably off |

- **Fix for these differences:**
  - **Match the sample (N=787)**. Standardized coefficients are sensitive to the estimation sample SDs.
  - **Match variable operationalization:**
    - *Education*: confirm same education measure (years vs degree categories converted to years).
    - *Income per capita*: confirm same definition (household income / household size) and same inflation adjustments/top-coding. Your `income_pc` values look like dollar amounts with decimals, suggesting some transformation; the paper’s measure may differ.
    - *Prestige*: confirm you’re using the same prestige scale (`prestg80` suggests 1980 prestige scale, which is plausible, but missing recodes and occupational coding can differ).
  - **Standardization rule:** You state: `beta_j = b_j * SD(X)/SD(Y)` using ddof=0. The paper likely uses the conventional sample SD (ddof=1). That alone can slightly shift betas (usually tiny but not always negligible).
    - **Fix:** compute standardized betas using sample SD with **ddof=1** (or use a package that replicates standard beta definitions), and ensure SDs computed on the exact estimation sample.

#### Models 2 and 3 coefficients missing entirely
- **Generated:** all betas are NaN/— due to empty sample
- **True:** full set of coefficients provided.
- **Fix:** once `hispanic` is properly constructed and intolerance is correctly built, rerun OLS with listwise deletion and then compute standardized betas.

---

### 4) Standard errors mismatch (and why you currently can’t “match” them)

- **Generated output:** shows a “-0.034” etc. under coefficients in the printed table, but **those are not standard errors**—they appear to be the *non-star coefficient formatted value*, while SEs are not printed at all in your `table1_style`.
- **True results note:** the PDF Table 1 **does not print standard errors**.
- **Mismatch:** You were asked to compare SEs, but **the “true” table does not contain SEs**, so you cannot validate them against Table 1.
- **Fix:** If you need to match SEs, you must:
  1) Obtain them from another table/appendix, or
  2) Reproduce them from the microdata using the **same estimator and same SE type** the authors used (OLS with conventional SE vs robust/clustered/weighted).
  
Also verify weighting: if the paper uses survey weights and you are not (or vice versa), coefficients and SEs will differ.

### 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches

#### Model 1 (SES) significance
- **Generated:** `educ` is *** (p ~ 1.77e-15), income and prestige not significant.
- **True:** education **-0.322***; income and prestige no stars.
- **Assessment:** Direction and significance pattern mostly aligns, but the magnitude differs.

#### Models 2 and 3 interpretation cannot match
- Because you produced no coefficients, any narrative interpretation for demographic predictors or political intolerance would be wrong/absent relative to the true table.
- **Fix:** After reconstructing Hispanic and intolerance and getting non-empty samples, check:
  - Signs: e.g., Age should be **positive**; Female should be **negative**; Southern **positive**; Political intolerance **positive**.
  - Star thresholds: match the paper’s two-tailed cutoffs (*<.05, <.01, <.001*).

### 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the “true” table

1) **Rebuild `hispanic`** (critical)
   - Find the correct raw field(s).
   - Create a 0/1 indicator matching the authors’ definition.
   - Confirm nonmissing count roughly consistent with the paper (should not be 0).

2) **Recreate `political_intolerance` exactly**
   - Same items, same direction, same scaling.
   - Same missingness rule (this is likely why your nonmissing=491 vs paper N=503).

3) **Align missing-value recoding**
   - Ensure all special codes are set to NA before modeling.

4) **Align sample restrictions**
   - The true table implies: SES model N=787, Demographic N=756, Intolerance N=503.
   - Your pipeline currently starts from “N_complete_music_18 = 893”; the paper’s base might differ.
   - Replicate the paper’s “complete music battery” rule and any age/year constraints.

5) **Estimate OLS on unstandardized variables, then compute standardized betas**
   - Don’t standardize X before fitting if you want constants comparable.
   - Compute standardized coefficients using the conventional SD (ddof=1) on the estimation sample.

6) **Check coding/reference groups**
   - Race dummies: make sure “White” (non-Hispanic) is the omitted category, and “other_race” is coded as in the paper.
   - Religion dummies: ensure the reference category matches (likely “moderate/liberal Protestant + Catholic/other” depending on their scheme).
   - Region: `southern` must match Census South definition used by authors.

If you paste the code (or at least the variable dictionary/raw column names) used to create `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`, I can point to the exact line(s) producing the empty samples and specify the corrected construction so N and coefficients line up with Table 1.
