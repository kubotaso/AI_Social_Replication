## A. Table/variable-name mismatches

### 1) **“Hispanic” is missing from the generated models**
- **True table:** Includes **Hispanic** in Models 2 and 3 with coefficients (-0.029; 0.031).
- **Generated output:** Explicitly omits Hispanic (“Hispanic omitted…”) and therefore **Model 2 and Model 3 are not the same specifications** as the true models.

**How to fix**
- Reconstruct a **Hispanic** dummy exactly as the original author did (usually from a race/ethnicity item where Hispanic is distinct from race, or from an “ethnic” variable).
- Then re-estimate Models 2 and 3 including Hispanic.
- Also ensure the **reference categories** for race match the article (commonly White = reference, with Black/Hispanic/Other dummies).

---

### 2) **Variable naming differs from Table 1**
Not fatal by itself, but it makes matching harder and may hide coding differences:
- **True:** “Household income per capita” vs **Generated:** `income_pc`
- **True:** “Occupational prestige” vs **Generated:** `prestg80`
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant” vs **Generated:** `conservative_protestant`
- **True DV label:** “Number of music genres disliked” vs generated uses `num_genres_disliked` (fine)

**How to fix**
- Rename variables in your reporting layer to match Table 1 labels.
- More importantly: confirm the *construction* matches (see discrepancies below).

## B. Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients**. Your `beta_std` should match those. Many do not.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | -0.310*** | wrong value |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.038 | close but not exact |
| Occ prestige | 0.016 | 0.025 | wrong value |
| Constant | 10.920 | 10.848 | wrong |
| R² | 0.107 | 0.097 | wrong |
| Adj R² | 0.104 | 0.094 | wrong |
| N | 787 | 748 | wrong sample size |

**Likely cause(s)**
- Different sample restrictions (your N is smaller).
- Different coding/standardization method (see Section D).
- Possible different year/subsample selection.

**Fix**
- Apply the *exact same* sample inclusion criteria as the article (year, age range, valid-response filters, listwise deletion rules).
- Standardize variables the same way the article did (often z-scoring on the estimation sample).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.245*** | essentially matches |
| HH income pc | -0.054 | -0.042 | wrong |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | 0.005 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.073* | wrong |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.101** | wrong magnitude + sig level |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.033 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | — | omitted (spec mismatch) |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.004 | close |
| Cons Protestant | 0.059 | 0.086* | wrong + becomes significant |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.005 | wrong |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.068 (p≈.065) | wrong + loses significance |
| Constant | 8.507 | 8.767 | wrong |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.124 | wrong |
| Adj R² | 0.139 | 0.111 | wrong |
| N | 756 | 698 | wrong |

**Likely cause(s)**
- Missing Hispanic + different N → coefficients shift.
- Age effect being much smaller suggests **age coding differences** (e.g., years vs categories, top-coding, or centering).
- Religion/regional differences suggest coding/reference category differences.

**Fix**
- Add Hispanic.
- Verify age is measured identically (raw years? restricted range?).
- Verify conservative Protestant and “no religion” match the paper’s denominators (e.g., mainline Protestant/Catholic/other as reference).
- Verify “Southern” definition matches (Census South vs “born in South” vs “resides in South”).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.153* | value close; sig differs |
| HH income pc | -0.009 | -0.012 | close |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | -0.009 | wrong |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.097* | close |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.038 | **major mismatch** |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.076 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | — | omitted (spec mismatch) |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.057 | close |
| Cons Protestant | 0.066 | 0.077 | mismatch |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.017 | mismatch |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.066 | **major mismatch** |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.148** | wrong magnitude + sig |
| Constant | 6.516 | 7.498 | wrong |
| R² | 0.169 | 0.122 | wrong |
| Adj R² | 0.148 | 0.096 | wrong |
| N | 503 | 395 | wrong |

**Likely cause(s)**
- Biggest drivers: **sample mismatch** (N 395 vs 503) and **political intolerance scale construction** mismatch (you drop 402 cases; the paper keeps more).
- Also missing Hispanic.

**Fix**
- Rebuild political intolerance exactly as in the paper:
  - Same items
  - Same coding direction
  - Same scale range
  - Same missing-data rule (e.g., allow partial completion, compute mean if ≥k items answered)
- Then re-run with the correct listwise deletion rules.
- Add Hispanic.

## C. Standard errors: fundamental reporting mismatch

### 1) Your table prints “standard errors” but Table 1 does not provide them
- **True results:** “standardized coefficients only” and **no SEs reported**.
- **Generated table:** shows a second row under each coefficient that appears to be an SE (e.g., educ has “-0.310***” then “-0.038”).

This is not just a mismatch; it’s **inventing quantities the source table does not contain**.

**How to fix**
- Either:
  1) **Remove SE rows entirely** to match the PDF table, *or*
  2) If you want SEs, compute and present them—but then you must clearly label them as *computed from your replication*, not “as printed,” and you still must match the same sample/spec to be comparable.

---

## D. Interpretation/scale mismatches implied by the numbers

### 1) You likely standardized differently than Table 1
Evidence: several βs are close but not exact, and R² differs systematically.

**Fix**
- Standardize **all predictors (and possibly DV)** using the same method as the author:
  - Most common for “standardized OLS coefficients”: run OLS on **z-scored X and z-scored Y**, or compute betas from unstandardized coefficients using SD ratios.
- Ensure SDs are computed on the **estimation sample for each model** (listwise sample), not the full dataset.

### 2) Sample-definition mismatch is pervasive (all N’s are too small)
- Model 1: 748 vs 787  
- Model 2: 698 vs 756  
- Model 3: 395 vs 503  

**Fix**
- Identify all filters you applied that the paper did not (or vice versa), especially:
  - Year/subsample selection (you mention 1993 N=1606 and “complete music_18” N=893; the paper’s N’s are larger than your model Ns but smaller than 893 suggests different gating)
  - Missing-data handling (especially for political intolerance)
  - Whether “don’t know/refused/not applicable” are set to missing in the same way
- Replicate the paper’s **exact** listwise deletion set per model.

### 3) Political intolerance missingness rule is almost certainly wrong
- You have `political_intolerance` missing for **402 of 893**, leaving 491 nonmissing, and listwise N becomes 395.
- Paper’s Model 3 N is **503**, meaning the paper retained **more** cases than your listwise approach.

**Fix**
- Use the paper’s inclusion rule for the intolerance index (often: require at least some minimum number of answered items, then average/sum available items).
- Don’t require “strict 15 items answered” unless the paper explicitly does.

---

## E. Significance/interpretation mismatches

Even when coefficients are similar, the **stars differ** in multiple places (e.g., Educ in Model 3 is ** in true but * in generated; Age loses significance entirely).
That follows from:
- Different N
- Different model specification (missing Hispanic)
- Different variable construction (age, intolerance scale)
- Possibly different standardization

**Fix**
- After matching specification + sample + coding, recompute p-values; then apply the same thresholds (the paper uses * .05, ** .01, *** .001).

---

## F. Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1) **Match the sample** the paper uses (year, eligibility, DV availability).  
2) **Recreate every variable** exactly:
   - Hispanic dummy
   - Political intolerance scale (items, scoring, partial-missing rule)
   - Religion categories and reference group
   - Southern definition
   - Income per capita definition (and any transformations/top-codes)
3) **Use the same missing-data policy** per model (listwise deletion on that model’s variables, but with the author’s construction rules that may reduce missingness).
4) **Compute standardized coefficients exactly as the paper** (z-score method consistent with Table 1).
5) **Report in the same format**:
   - Betas only (no SEs) if you want to match the printed Table 1.

If you paste (or screenshot) the paper’s variable coding notes / appendix for income, Hispanic, religion, South, and political intolerance, I can point to the exact recodes needed and the most likely reason each coefficient shifts.
