Score: 41/100
============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics: n, R², adj. R² all mismatch

### Model 1 (SES)
- **n**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller (extra casewise deletion). Ensure Model 1 uses only the variables in Model 1 for listwise deletion (DV + educ + inc_pc + prestige), and that missing codes are recoded to NA identically to the paper.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.088 / 0.085**
  - True: **0.107 / 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample and variable construction match (especially DV and education), R² should move toward the published values. Also verify you are using **OLS with an intercept** and no weights (paper table appears unweighted).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **n**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** Massive over-deletion. Most likely causes:
  1) you inadvertently required **non-missing pol_intol** even though Model 2 does not include it (common bug if you filter on all variables used anywhere);
  2) you used `pol_intol_n` or another derived variable in the data prep step that forced complete cases.
  
  Concretely: build the analysis dataset *separately per model* with complete cases on only that model’s variables.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.139 / 0.120**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Primarily the sample mismatch; secondarily some coefficients’ directions are off (see below), which also changes R².

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **n**
  - Generated: **334**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Again over-deletion. You’re throwing away far more than the paper. Check:
  - political intolerance variable coding (should be 0–15 as in table),
  - missing-value recodes,
  - whether you inadvertently subset to respondents with non-missing on *unneeded* items (e.g., race dummies created in a way that introduces NA).

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.142 / 0.110**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** same as above; also some predictors are mis-coded (income, prestige, and South especially).

## 2) Variable-name mismatches (and why they matter)

The **paper’s Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)** and **unstandardized constants**. Your output mixes:
- unstandardized slopes (`b`)
- standardized slopes (`beta`)
- p-values and stars computed from your model (paper’s stars come from their model)

**Mismatch:** Your “table1style” uses `beta` values (good), but your “full” models also display `b` and use p-values derived from your (different) model/sample.

**Fix:**
- If you want to match Table 1 exactly, produce a table of **standardized coefficients only** (β) plus **unstandardized constant**, with stars based on p-values from the correctly matched model.
- Ensure the standardization method matches typical regression standardization:  
  \[
  \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{sd(x_j)}{sd(y)}
  \]
  computed on the **estimation sample for that model**.

Also check naming/coding consistency:
- Generated uses `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` with implicit reference category “white”. That’s fine, but only if the paper uses the same reference and coding.

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (β’s) and how to fix

Below I compare the **standardized coefficients (β)** because that’s what Table 1 reports.

### Model 1 (SES): mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Problem | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | Too small in magnitude | Likely sample mismatch (n 747 vs 787) and/or education coding differs (e.g., yrs vs degree). Use same education variable and same missing handling. |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | Very close | Minor; will align with correct sample. |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | Slightly high | Will likely align once sample matches. |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | Off | Constant is sensitive to sample and DV coding. Verify DV (“# genres disliked”) is constructed identically and not top/bottom-coded differently. |

**Also:** Your R² is too low, consistent with sample/variable construction differences.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic): major direction/significance mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Problem | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.265*** | **-0.246*** | A bit too negative | Sample mismatch (507 vs 756) drives this. |
| Income pc | **-0.051** | **-0.054** | Close | Sample mismatch minor. |
| Prestige | **-0.011** | **-0.006** | Close | Minor. |
| Female | **-0.085***? (you show * ) | **-0.083***? (true is *) | Close | Should align once sample matches. |
| **Age** | **0.103***? (you show *) | **0.140*** | Too small and wrong significance level | Sample mismatch + possibly age scaling (years vs categories) or restricting age range. Ensure age is continuous years, same coding as paper. |
| **Black** | **0.100** | **0.029** | Far too large | Likely coding or sample issue (e.g., race variable miscoded, or reference category wrong, or you’re using “black vs nonblack” while paper uses “black vs white”). Recreate race dummies exactly: white as reference; black/hispanic/other mutually exclusive. |
| **Hispanic** | **0.074** | **-0.029** | Wrong sign | Strong evidence of miscoding: possibly your “hispanic” dummy indicates “not hispanic” or overlaps with race differently than paper. Ensure Hispanic is coded per paper (often ethnicity separate from race in GSS; paper may treat Hispanic as a dummy irrespective of race—your approach must match theirs). |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **0.005** | Wrong sign | Same race/ethnicity construction issue. |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.087** | **0.059** | Too large | Denomination coding may differ (e.g., including evangelicals differently). |
| No religion | **-0.015** | **-0.012** | Close | Minor. |
| **Southern** | **0.061** (ns) | **0.097** (**)** | Too small and loses significance | Likely because of wrong sample and/or region coding (e.g., South vs “born in South”, or using a different GSS region variable). Confirm exact “South” definition used in paper. |
| Constant | **8.675** | **8.507** | Off | Sample + DV coding. |

**Key diagnosis for Model 2:** You cannot match Table 1 while using **n=507**; plus your race/ethnicity coefficients’ signs strongly suggest **dummy construction does not match the paper**.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): multiple mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Problem | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.144***? (you show *) | **-0.151** (**) | Close | Sample mismatch (334 vs 503) and perhaps different SEs/stars. |
| **Income pc** | **-0.062** | **-0.009** | Way too negative | Income variable likely not constructed as “per capita” the same way as paper, or you standardized differently, or sample is distorted. Verify per-capita computation and any log/scale decisions. |
| Prestige | **0.008** | **-0.022** | Wrong sign | Prestige variable mismatch (different prestige measure, reverse-coded scale, or incorrect merge). Ensure you’re using the same prestige scale (paper: “Occupational prestige”). |
| Female | **-0.122***? (you show *) | **-0.095* ** | Too negative | Sample mismatch. |
| **Age** | **0.079** (ns) | **0.110* ** | Too small, wrong sig | Age coding/sample issue. |
| Black | **0.122** | **0.049** | Too large | Race coding/sample issue persists. |
| Hispanic | **0.052** | **0.031** | Somewhat high | Same. |
| Other race | **0.035** | **0.053** | Lower | Same. |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.053** | **0.066** | Slightly low | Denomination coding. |
| No religion | **0.027** | **0.024** | Close | Minor. |
| **Southern** | **0.070** (ns) | **0.121** (**) | Too small, wrong sig | South coding/sample mismatch. |
| Political intolerance | **0.197*** | **0.164*** | Too large | Political intolerance variable scaling or sample mismatch. Confirm it is exactly 0–15 and constructed from the same items and missing rules as the paper. |
| Constant | **6.464** | **6.516** | Close | Would likely align with correct sample. |

## 4) Standard errors: your generated output includes them implicitly (via p), but Table 1 does not

- **Generated:** reports p-values/stars derived from your regression SEs.
- **True:** SEs not reported; stars are based on their SEs.

**Fix:** You can still compute p-values, but you must:
1) match the model spec + sample + coding exactly, and then
2) your stars will align.  
Until then, star mismatches are expected.

Also, if you’re trying to reproduce *only what’s in the printed table*, don’t present SEs/p-values as if they were “true”; present them as “replication p-values” and note Table 1 omits SE.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches (implied by signs/stars)

Even without your narrative, the generated tables imply interpretations that would contradict the paper when signs differ:

- **Model 2 Hispanic:** Generated positive; True negative → you would wrongly conclude Hispanics dislike more genres, while Table 1 suggests slightly fewer (ns).
- **Model 3 Income:** Generated strong negative; True near zero → you would overstate income’s role.
- **Prestige in Model 3:** Generated ~0 positive; True negative → different substantive conclusion.
- **Southern in Models 2–3:** Generated weak; True clearly positive and significant → you would miss a key regional effect.

**Fix:** Do not interpret until the coding/sample is corrected; then re-run and rewrite interpretation.

---

## 6) Concrete “how to fix” checklist to make generated match true

1) **Model-specific complete-case samples**
   - Build three separate datasets:
     - M1 complete cases on {DV, educ, inc_pc, prestige}
     - M2 complete cases on {DV, educ, inc_pc, prestige, female, age, black, hispanic, otherrace, cons_prot, norelig, south}
     - M3 complete cases on {all M2 vars + pol_intol}
   - Do **not** filter on `pol_intol` for Model 2.

2) **Recreate DV exactly**
   - Your DV appears as `num_genres_disliked` with 44% missing. Verify:
     - same set of music genres as paper,
     - same “dislike” coding,
     - same rule for partial nonresponse (paper may allow summing with some missing; you might be setting DV missing if any genre item missing, inflating missingness and shrinking n).

3) **Race/ethnicity dummy construction**
   - Ensure categories are **mutually exclusive** and match paper’s definitions.
   - Common GSS pitfall: Hispanic ethnicity is separate; if you code Hispanic as a race category incorrectly, signs/magnitudes can flip.
   - Replicate paper’s approach: (a) treat Hispanic as its own dummy regardless of race, or (b) treat it as a mutually exclusive race/ethnic group—whichever the paper did. Your current results strongly suggest mismatch here.

4) **Income per capita + prestige**
   - Verify `inc_pc` is computed the same way (household income / household size, same income measure, same top-coding, no log unless paper did).
   - Verify prestige variable is the same scale and direction (paper’s “Occupational prestige”; in GSS there are multiple prestige measures/years).

5) **South variable**
   - Confirm definition: region of residence vs birthplace vs census region grouping. Use the same.

6) **Standardized coefficients**
   - Compute standardized β on the **same estimation sample** as each model.
   - Keep constant unstandardized.

If you share the code (or at least how you constructed: DV, Hispanic/Black/Other, income per capita, prestige, intolerance scale, and the complete-case filtering), I can point to the exact line(s) causing the n collapse and the sign flips.
