Score: 34/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics (R² / adj. R² / N) — **all mismatched**

**Model 1 (SES)**
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - Fix: Your analytic sample is smaller than the paper’s. Align to the paper’s **listwise deletion rules and variable construction** for Model 1. Most likely you’re dropping cases due to missingness in variables that *shouldn’t* be in Model 1 (e.g., race/religion vars), or you recoded SES vars differently (creating extra missing).
- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.088 / 0.0846**
  - True: **0.107 / 0.104**
  - Fix: Once the sample and variable definitions match, R² should move closer. Also ensure you’re using **OLS with the same DV and same coding** (see DV section below).

**Model 2 (Demographic)**
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - Fix: You’re losing ~249 extra cases. The big red flag is that race variables show ~35% missing in your “missingness” table—race should not be missing at that rate in the GSS. That suggests a **merge/join error, incorrect filtering to a subsample, or recoding that turned valid values into NA**.
- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.135 / 0.1179**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - Fix: Same as above—get N and coding right.

**Model 3 (Political intolerance)**
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - Fix: Your `pol_intol` has **47% missing** (756 missing out of 1606). That is likely not how the paper constructed “political intolerance” (often it’s an index built from multiple items with partial allowance, or it uses different source items/years). Reconstruct the intolerance measure exactly as the paper did.
- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.145 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - Fix: Once political intolerance is constructed correctly and N matches, R² should increase.

### 2) Variable name / inclusion mismatches

**“otherrace” is being dropped / is NA in Models 2 and 3**
- Generated:
  - fit_stats shows `dropped = otherrace` for Models 2–3
  - coefficient row is **NaN** for “Other race”
- True:
  - “Other race” is included with nonzero β in both models (Model 2: **0.005**, Model 3: **0.053**)

**What’s wrong**
- Perfect collinearity or zero variance (e.g., your `otherrace` is all 0/NA in the estimation sample), or you created race dummies incorrectly (e.g., included all race dummies plus an intercept without a reference category; or miscoded race such that “other” overlaps with Black/Hispanic).

**Fix**
- Create race categories with **one omitted reference group** (typically White as reference):
  - include `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` (0/1), **omit white**, keep intercept
- Ensure mutually exclusive coding:
  - `black==1` implies `hispanic==0` and `otherrace==0`, etc.
- Check for recode-to-NA mistakes:
  - Tabulate raw race variable vs. your dummies; confirm “other” exists and is not all missing.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized β and constants)

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors, and **unstandardized constants**. Your “Table1style” outputs appear to be β (good), but they still don’t match the true β in many places.

#### Model 1 β mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | **-0.292** | **-0.322** | Mismatch | Likely sample/coding mismatch; ensure education in years and same sample (N=787). |
| Inc pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | Close (minor) | Should improve with correct sample. |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | Mismatch | Prestige scale/variable may differ (e.g., using `prestg80_v` vs the paper’s prestige measure/coding). |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | Mismatch | Constant depends on DV coding and sample. Ensure DV exactly matches and no unintended centering/standardization of DV. |

#### Model 2 β mismatches
Key mismatches:
- Education: Generated **-0.264*** vs True **-0.246*** (mismatch)
- Prestige: Generated **-0.016** vs True **-0.006** (mismatch)
- **Age:** Generated **0.104***? (you mark only `*`) vs True **0.140*** (mismatch in magnitude and significance)
- **Hispanic sign:** Generated **+0.030** vs True **-0.029** (sign mismatch)
- Southern: Generated **0.063** vs True **0.097** and **True is significant (**)** (you show not significant)
- Conservative Protestant: Generated **0.090 (p≈.053)** vs True **0.059** (mismatch)
- Other race missing entirely (major issue)

**Fixes**
- After fixing sample construction, race coding, and weights (if any), re-estimate.
- The **Hispanic sign flip** strongly suggests a coding/referent problem:
  - you may be coding Hispanic as 1 for non-Hispanic or using a different baseline than the paper.
  - Verify coding: `hispanic = 1` iff respondent is Hispanic.
- Age effect is too small: could be because age is not coded as in paper (e.g., top-coded, different age variable, or scaled/centered).

#### Model 3 β mismatches
- Education: Generated **-0.157***? (shown `*`) vs True **-0.151** with ** (p<.01)** → your significance is weaker
- Income: Generated **-0.050** vs True **-0.009** (large mismatch)
- Prestige: Generated **-0.011** vs True **-0.022** (mismatch)
- Female: Generated **-0.122** vs True **-0.095** (mismatch)
- **Age:** Generated **0.083 (ns)** vs True **0.110* (sig)** (mismatch)
- Southern: Generated **0.065 (ns)** vs True **0.121** **(sig)** (large mismatch)
- Political intolerance: Generated **0.190** **(p=.00265 → “**”)** vs True **0.164*** (mismatch magnitude and significance level)
- Other race missing (major)

**Fixes**
- Biggest driver is almost certainly the **political intolerance measure** and/or severe listwise deletion (N=286 vs 503).
- Rebuild the intolerance index exactly per the paper; do not introduce huge missingness.
- Recheck income per capita construction; your income effect in Model 3 is far more negative than the paper’s.

### 4) Standard errors: interpretation mismatch

- **True results:** Table 1 does **not report standard errors**; only stars.
- **Generated results:** you report p-values (implying SEs were computed), but you **do not display SEs**.

This is not a “numeric mismatch” per se, but it *is* a reporting mismatch:
- If your goal is to reproduce the paper’s Table 1, you should **not claim SEs from the table**, and you should focus on reproducing **standardized β and stars**.
- If your goal is to reproduce results from raw data, then SEs/p-values are fine—but then the target should be the *paper’s underlying model*, not the extracted table.

**Fix**
- Decide the target:
  1) **Match Table 1 exactly**: output only standardized β, constants, R², adj R², N, and stars using the paper’s thresholds.
  2) **Full regression output**: show b, SE, p—but then accept that Table 1 is not giving SEs and match only β/stars/R²/N.

---

### 5) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation errors)

Because your coefficients/p-values differ (due to N/coding), your stars don’t align with the paper:

Examples:
- Model 2 Age: True is ***(p<.001)**; generated only `*` (p≈.0176).
- Model 2 Southern: True is **; generated none.
- Model 3 Political intolerance: True is ***; generated **.
- Model 3 Education: True is **; generated *.

**Fix**
- These will correct automatically once:
  - N matches,
  - variables are coded identically,
  - “other race” is included properly,
  - political intolerance is constructed as in the paper.

---

### 6) DV construction / sample-year mismatch signals

Your DV descriptives show:
- nonmissing DV = **893**
- range: **0 to 18**, mean **5.78**, SD **3.76**

The paper’s N in Model 1 is 787, so the DV alone isn’t the limiting factor. The massive extra missingness appears in:
- race dummies (34.99% missing)
- pol_intol (47.07% missing)

**Fix checklist**
1) Confirm you are using **GSS 1993** only (paper is explicit).
2) Confirm DV is exactly “Number of Music Genres Disliked” and computed the same way (same set of genre items; same handling of DK/NA).
3) Recode race from the canonical GSS race/ethnicity variables without turning large portions into NA.
4) Construct `pol_intol` per the paper’s item set and missing-data rule (often “require at least k of m items,” not strict listwise across all items).

---

## Practical “make it match” action plan
1) **Recreate the exact analytic samples per model**
   - Model 1: listwise on {DV, educ, inc_pc, prestige}
   - Model 2: listwise on Model 1 vars + {female, age, race dummies, religion dummies, south}
   - Model 3: listwise on Model 2 vars + {pol_intol}
   - Verify resulting N equals **787 / 756 / 503**
2) **Fix race coding so Other race is estimable**
   - One reference group (White), mutually exclusive dummies, no all-NA column.
3) **Rebuild political intolerance index to reduce missingness**
   - Match the paper’s exact items and missingness rule.
4) **Confirm you’re outputting standardized coefficients (β)**
   - The paper’s Table 1 uses β; ensure your “Table1style” uses the same standardization convention (typically standardize X and Y, or compute β from OLS using SDs).
5) **Re-run and compare β, constants, R², adj R², N**
   - Stars should then align closely.

If you share your variable construction code (especially race, `inc_pc`, and `pol_intol`) and your filtering (how you subset to 1993), I can point to the exact line(s) creating the N collapse and the “Other race” drop.
