### 0) A key structural discrepancy (drives many downstream mismatches)
**True Table 1 prints standardized coefficients only and does not report SEs.**  
Your **Generated Results include p-values and significance stars**, which necessarily come from **some set of standard errors**—but those SEs are **not recoverable from the PDF table** and therefore cannot be validated against the “true” table.

**Fix:** If you want to “match Table 1,” you must:
- **Remove SEs/p-values/stars that are computed from your re-estimation**, and
- Print **only standardized coefficients** and the fit statistics shown (R², Adj. R², N, constant), OR
- If you insist on inference: clearly label it as **re-estimated from the dataset** and do **not** present it as “as printed in Table 1.”

Everything below compares *generated standardized betas* vs the *true standardized betas as printed*.

## 1) Mismatches in coefficients (standardized betas)

### Model 1 (SES)
| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.332 | -0.322 | too negative by 0.010 |
| income_pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | not negative enough by 0.003 |
| prestg80 | 0.029 | 0.016 | too positive by 0.013 |
| Constant | 11.086 | 10.920 | too high by 0.166 |
| R² | 0.109 | 0.107 | too high by 0.002 |
| Adj R² | 0.105 | 0.104 | too high by 0.001 |
| N | 758 | 787 | **wrong sample size** (-29) |

**How to fix**
- **Sample definition is not matching the paper’s.** Your missingness table shows you are doing complete-case deletion on `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, giving **758**, but the published model has **787**.  
  Likely causes:
  1) **Different construction of income per capita** (paper may impute/retain more cases, or use a different income variable / top-coding / equivalization).  
  2) **Different missing-data rule** (paper may allow partial information or use imputation).
  3) **Different year/subsample filter** (you report `N_year_1993=1606` and `N_complete_music_18=893`; the paper’s analytic N for M1 implies a different filtration pipeline).
- To match Table 1: replicate the paper’s **exact inclusion criteria and variable construction** (especially income and prestige), then recompute **standardized betas** on that sample.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.260 | -0.246 | too negative by 0.014 |
| income_pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | not negative enough by 0.003 |
| prestg80 | 0.007 | -0.006 | **sign differs** (+ vs −) |
| female | -0.090 | -0.083 | too negative by 0.007 |
| age | 0.129 | 0.140 | too small by 0.011 |
| black | 0.009 | 0.029 | too small by 0.020 |
| hispanic | 0.026 | -0.029 | **sign differs** (+ vs −) |
| other_race | 0.001 | 0.005 | too small by 0.004 |
| conservative_protestant | 0.065 | 0.059 | too large by 0.006 |
| no_religion | -0.005 | -0.012 | too close to 0 by 0.007 |
| southern | 0.085 | 0.097 | too small by 0.012 |
| Constant | 8.804 | 8.507 | too high by 0.297 |
| R² | 0.145 | 0.151 | too low by 0.006 |
| Adj R² | 0.133 | 0.139 | too low by 0.006 |
| N | 756 | 756 | matches |

**How to fix**
- Since **N matches (756)** but several coefficients’ **signs differ** (`prestg80`, `hispanic`) and many magnitudes differ, the problem is probably **coding / reference categories / standardization procedure**, not case selection.
- Most likely issues:
  1) **Race/ethnicity dummy construction doesn’t match the paper.**  
     - Your `hispanic` appears to be coded as an independent dummy alongside `black` and `other_race`. If the paper uses **mutually exclusive categories** (e.g., white omitted; black, hispanic, other are exclusive), your coding must enforce that.  
     - If Hispanic respondents can also be coded as black/other in your data pipeline, coefficients can flip.
  2) **Religion coding**: “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” depend on denominational recodes; mismatches here also shift other coefficients.
  3) **Standardization mismatch**: The paper reports standardized coefficients; you must standardize *the same way*. If you standardize using the analysis sample vs full sample, or standardize binaries incorrectly (some authors standardize only continuous predictors), betas will differ.

**Concrete fixes**
- Rebuild the demographic dummies to match the paper:
  - Ensure **one omitted reference group** (likely White, non-Hispanic; non-Southern; non-Conservative-Protestant; has religion; male).
  - Ensure **mutual exclusivity** among race categories and consistent Hispanic treatment (either as its own mutually exclusive category or as ethnicity with race handled differently—match the paper).
- Standardize exactly as the authors did:
  - Most common for “standardized OLS coefficients”: **z-score DV and each predictor in the estimation sample**, then run OLS; report resulting coefficients.
  - Confirm whether they standardized **binary indicators** too (often yes in “beta” tables, but sometimes no). Your table implies you did standardize binaries (since they’re in beta units). If the paper did something else, adjust.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.155 | -0.151 | close (off by 0.004) |
| income_pc | -0.016 | -0.009 | too negative by 0.007 |
| prestg80 | -0.008 | -0.022 | too close to 0 by 0.014 |
| female | -0.116 | -0.095 | too negative by 0.021 |
| age | 0.060 | 0.110 | **too small by 0.050** |
| black | -0.005 | 0.049 | **sign differs** and large gap |
| hispanic | 0.090 | 0.031 | too large by 0.059 |
| other_race | 0.052 | 0.053 | essentially matches |
| conservative_protestant | 0.051 | 0.066 | too small by 0.015 |
| no_religion | 0.017 | 0.024 | too small by 0.007 |
| southern | 0.090 | 0.121 | too small by 0.031 |
| political_intolerance | 0.172 | 0.164 | too large by 0.008 |
| Constant | 7.258 | 6.516 | too high by 0.742 |
| R² | 0.143 | 0.169 | too low by 0.026 |
| Adj R² | 0.118 | 0.148 | too low by 0.030 |
| N | 426 | 503 | **wrong sample size** (-77) |

**How to fix**
- The biggest issue is **sample construction for political intolerance**:
  - Your diagnostics say `polintol_rule = strict_complete_15_of_15` and `polintol_nonmissing = 491`, yet your Model 3 N is **426**, while the paper’s is **503**.
  - That indicates you are **dropping far more cases** than the authors, almost certainly because your political intolerance index requires an overly strict completeness rule (and/or additional missingness from other covariates).

**Concrete fixes**
1) **Match the paper’s political intolerance scale construction.**  
   Your rule “complete 15 of 15” is very likely *not* what the authors used. Many papers:
   - allow partial completion and compute a mean/scale if ≥k items answered,
   - use item-level imputation,
   - or use fewer items than 15 (depending on the survey battery).
2) **Reproduce the paper’s Model 3 analytic N (503).**  
   - Start from the same base sample used for DV, then apply the authors’ missing-data rules for polintol and covariates until you hit **503**.
3) Once N matches, expect large coefficient corrections especially for **age, black, hispanic, southern, R²**—all of which are currently far from printed values and consistent with a non-comparable subsample.

## 2) Significance / interpretation mismatches (stars and p-values)
Because the true table’s stars are tied to the printed coefficients (and to SEs not shown), your star assignments frequently do not align:

Examples:
- **Model 2 female**: True is **-0.083*** (p<.05), Generated shows **-0.090\*\*** (p<.01).  
- **Model 2 southern**: True **0.097\*\*** (p<.01), Generated **0.085\*** (p<.05).  
- **Model 3 political_intolerance**: True **0.164\*\*\*** (p<.001), Generated **0.172\*\*** (p<.01).

**Fix**
- If matching the printed table: **use the paper’s stars exactly** and do not compute your own p-values.
- If presenting re-estimated results: **do not compare stars to the printed ones** unless you have replicated the identical model, sample, weighting, and variance estimator.

---

## 3) Variable naming mismatches (minor but important for reproducibility)
The “true” table uses descriptive names; your generated output uses dataset-like names:
- `educ` vs **Education**
- `income_pc` vs **Household income per capita**
- `prestg80` vs **Occupational prestige**
- `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `southern` align conceptually but need confirmation of coding.
- `political_intolerance` aligns but construction differs (see N discrepancy).

**Fix**
- Provide a **label map** in the table output so names match Table 1 exactly.
- More importantly, document coding (0/1), reference categories, and scale construction.

---

## 4) What you must replicate for the generated analysis to match the “true” table
To make the generated table match the printed one, you need to replicate **all** of the following:

1) **Exact analytic sample per model**
- Model 1 must yield **N=787** (you have 758).
- Model 3 must yield **N=503** (you have 426).

2) **Exact variable construction**
- Income per capita: same source variable, equivalization, inflation adjustment (if any), transformations, top-coding, handling of missing.
- Prestige (`prestg80`): same occupational prestige scale and handling of non-employed.
- Race/ethnicity: same mutually exclusive categories and Hispanic treatment.
- Religion: same definition for “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion”.
- Political intolerance: same item set and missing-data rule (your “15 of 15 complete” is very likely wrong).

3) **Same estimation choices**
- Standardized betas computed the same way (standardize DV and X’s in the same sample; confirm treatment of binaries).
- Any **weights**, clustering, or design corrections used in the article (if the paper used survey weights and you didn’t, coefficients can shift).

If you want, paste (a) the code you used to build `income_pc`, race/religion dummies, and `political_intolerance`, and (b) whether you used weights. I can then pinpoint the exact coding step(s) most likely responsible for the sign flips (`hispanic`, `prestg80`, Model 3 `black`) and the big N gaps (Models 1 and 3).
