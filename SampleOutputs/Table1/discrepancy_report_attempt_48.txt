============================================================

Below is a systematic mismatch audit between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, covering fit stats, variable names, coefficients, SE/p-stars, and interpretation. I also specify concrete fixes so the generated analysis reproduces the paper’s Table 1.

---

## 1) Fit statistics (R², adj. R², N): mismatches

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s. Align the inclusion rules to the paper’s (see Section 4 on missingness/weights). Ensure the dependent variable and the three SES predictors are the *only* required non-missing fields for Model 1.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, **Adj R² = 0.085**
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, **Adj R² = 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once you replicate the sample definition (and weighting/standardization), R² should move toward the published values. A persistent gap usually indicates either (a) different variable coding, (b) weights not used when they should be, or (c) different DV construction.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** You are dropping far too many cases. This is almost certainly from (i) using variables not in the paper’s model, (ii) listwise deletion triggered by miscoded missing values, and/or (iii) incorrectly handling race dummies (see “Other race” issue below).

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.135 / 0.118**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Same as above—once sample/coding matches, fit should align more closely.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **334**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Again, excessive deletion. Specifically check construction of **political intolerance** and whether you’re inadvertently requiring non-missing on items not used in the index.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.137 / 0.108**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Align DV, pol intolerance index, weights, and sample selection.

---

## 2) Variable name / inclusion mismatches

### A. “Other race” is missing/dropped in Models 2–3 (major discrepancy)
- Generated:
  - In fit_stats: `dropped otherrace`
  - In model tables: **Other race = NaN**
- True:
  - Model 2: **Other race β = 0.005**
  - Model 3: **Other race β = 0.053**

**Why this happens**
- Perfect collinearity (dummy trap) or zero variance in the estimation sample, or a coding error where “Other race” is always 0/NA after filtering.

**Fix**
- Ensure the race specification matches the paper:
  - Create mutually exclusive race dummies **Black, Hispanic, Other race**, leaving **White as the omitted reference**.
  - Do **not** include all race categories plus an intercept.
- Validate coding before regression:
  - Confirm `mean(otherrace)` is > 0 and < 1 in the analytic sample.
  - Confirm race categories are mutually exclusive (no case coded as both black and hispanic, etc., unless the paper allows it—Table 1 implies mutually exclusive categories).

### B. The generated output mixes unstandardized b and standardized beta
- Generated reports both `b` and `beta` plus p-values.
- True Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** and **constants unstandardized**, and **no SEs/p-values shown**, only stars.

**Fix**
- To match Table 1, your main “Table1style” output should be:
  - **β (standardized) for predictors**
  - **unstandardized intercept**
  - **R², Adj R², N**
  - **stars based on p-values**, but do not display SEs.
- If you keep `b` internally, fine—but Table 1 comparison must be done on **β**, not b.

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model (and how to fix)

Below I compare **standardized coefficients (β)** because that is what the true Table 1 reports.

### Model 1
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (OK-ish) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | slightly high |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | too low |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | too low |
| N | **747** | **787** | too low |

**Fix drivers**
- Sample definition/weights/coding. Education effect and intercept differences commonly come from different education coding (years vs degree categories) or from including/excluding particular respondents.

### Model 2
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.264*** | **-0.246*** | too large in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.053** | **-0.054** | close |
| Prestige | **-0.016** | **-0.006** | too negative |
| Female | **-0.090***? | **-0.083***? | close on size; stars differ (see Section 5) |
| Age | **0.104***? | **0.140*** | substantially too small |
| Black | **0.043** | **0.029** | a bit high |
| Hispanic | **0.030** | **-0.029** | **sign mismatch (important)** |
| Other race | **(dropped/NaN)** | **0.005** | missing |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.090** | **0.059** | too large |
| No religion | **-0.019** | **-0.012** | slightly too negative |
| Southern | **0.063** | **0.097** | too small; also star mismatch |

**Fix drivers**
- **Hispanic sign flip** strongly suggests a coding/referent problem:
  - You may have coded Hispanic as 1 for non-Hispanic (reversed), or built race/ethnicity in a non-mutually-exclusive way.
  - Or you used a different reference category scheme.
- **Age β too small** can happen if:
  - age is coded differently (e.g., age categories vs continuous),
  - age is centered/scaled inconsistently before standardization,
  - weights/sample differ.

### Model 3
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.140*** | **-0.151** | slightly too small |
| Income pc | **-0.066** | **-0.009** | **major mismatch** |
| Prestige | **0.009** | **-0.022** | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | **-0.124*** | **-0.095*** | too negative |
| Age | **0.072** | **0.110** | too small |
| Black | **0.064** | **0.049** | close-ish |
| Hispanic | **0.014** | **0.031** | too small |
| Other race | **(dropped/NaN)** | **0.053** | missing |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.052** | **0.066** | too small |
| No religion | **0.024** | **0.024** | matches |
| Southern | **0.072** | **0.121** | too small |
| Political intolerance | **0.205*** | **0.164*** | too large |
| Constant | **6.986** | **6.516** | too high |
| R² | **0.137** | **0.169** | too low |
| N | **334** | **503** | too low |

**Fix drivers**
- The **income β (-0.066 vs -0.009)** is the biggest red flag: it implies your income-per-capita variable, its transformation, or standardization is not what the paper used.
  - You might be using raw income or a differently scaled income measure than the paper.
  - Or you standardized incorrectly (e.g., standardized within a filtered subgroup).
- **Prestige sign flip** suggests prestige variable mismatch (wrong prestige scale, reverse-coded, or using a different occupational prestige variable).
- Political intolerance β too large likely indicates your **pol_intol** index differs (item selection, coding direction, missing-data handling, scaling to 0–15).

---

## 4) Missingness / sample construction problems (root cause of N gaps)

Your missingness table shows (key points):
- DV `num_genres_disliked`: **44.4% missing**
- `pol_intol`: **36.2% missing**
- `hispanic`: **35.0% missing**

But in your model Ns:
- Model 1 uses **747** cases (requires DV + SES vars)
- Model 2 drops to **507** (huge loss)
- Model 3 drops to **334** (even more)

Given that `female/black/otherrace/south` have 0% missing, the **big extra drop in Model 2** is consistent with **hispanic** having massive missingness in your constructed variable—yet in GSS-style coding, Hispanic ethnicity usually isn’t missing for a third of cases unless you recoded “not asked”/“dk” into NA incorrectly or used the wrong source variable/year.

**Fix**
1. **Rebuild `hispanic` exactly as the paper did** (and ensure year compatibility).
   - If the item was not asked of all respondents, the paper may have restricted the sample differently (e.g., to those asked the music module and ethnicity questions) or used a different ethnicity proxy.
2. **Use the paper’s case selection order**
   - For each model, do listwise deletion only on variables in that model.
   - Do not pre-filter on Model 3 variables and reuse that sample for Models 1–2 (a very common replication mistake that would shrink Model 1/2 artificially).
3. **Handle “DK/NA/IAP” codes correctly**
   - In GSS, special codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) need consistent missing recodes. If you accidentally turned a valid category into NA, you inflate missingness and reduce N.

---

## 5) Standard errors / p-values / stars: reporting and interpretation mismatches

### A. True Table 1 does not report SEs
- Generated output includes p-values and (implicitly) SEs were used.
- The “true results” explicitly state **SE not reported**.

**Fix**
- Don’t claim mismatches in SEs versus Table 1 because Table 1 has none.
- If your task is to reproduce the table, output stars from your model p-values but **do not display SEs** in the Table 1 reproduction.

### B. Stars differ in several places (implied p-values differ)
Examples:
- **Age (Model 2)**: Generated only `*` but True is `***`.
- **Southern (Model 2)**: Generated no star; True is `**`.
- **Education (Model 3)**: Generated `*`; True is `**`.
- **Age (Model 3)**: Generated none; True is `*`.

**Fix**
- Once coefficients and N match, p-values will move toward published stars. If stars still differ after coefficient alignment, check:
  - whether the paper used **weights** and/or **robust SEs**,
  - whether the paper used a different alpha mapping or rounding,
  - whether there are minor differences in df due to missingness.

---

## 6) Weighting mismatch (likely)

Your `weight_used` is blank:
- Generated: `weight_col` empty → suggests **no weights used**.

Many GSS analyses apply weights (e.g., `WTSSALL` / `WTSSNR` depending on year/module). If the paper used weights and you did not, you can easily get different βs, stars, and Ns (depending on how weights interact with missingness handling in your pipeline).

**Fix**
- Verify in the paper’s methods whether weights were used.
- If yes:
  - apply the same weight variable,
  - use weighted OLS,
  - compute standardized coefficients in a way consistent with weighting (at minimum: fit weighted model; for β replicate the paper’s approach—some software computes β from weighted SDs).

---

## 7) Interpretation mismatch (conceptual)

### A. You treat “Political intolerance (0–15)” as 0–15, but your coefficient reported is β=0.205
- True β is **0.164***.
- This suggests your *constructed scale or standardization* differs.

**Fix**
- Reconstruct the political intolerance scale exactly:
  - same items,
  - same coding direction,
  - same missing-data rule (e.g., require all items vs allow partial),
  - same range (0–15).
- Then standardize predictors for β computation consistently with the other variables.

# Summary of what to change to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Recreate the exact analytic sample per model** (don’t reuse the most restrictive sample across models).
2. **Fix race/ethnicity coding**:
   - ensure Hispanic is coded correctly (and not reversed),
   - ensure “Other race” is included (not dropped) with White as reference.
3. **Verify variable construction/scales**:
   - income per capita scaling (the Model 3 income β mismatch is a strong indicator),
   - occupational prestige variable identity and direction,
   - political intolerance index construction to match 0–15 and item handling.
4. **Apply the correct weights** if the paper used them (your output suggests none).
5. **Match reporting format**:
   - Table 1 uses **standardized β** and **unstandardized constant**,
   - no SEs shown; only stars.

If you share your codebook mapping (which GSS variables you used for `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, `hispanic`, and the `pol_intol` index), I can pinpoint the exact recode/merge step causing each of the big sign and magnitude errors (Hispanic, income in Model 3, prestige sign flip, and “Other race” dropping).
