Score: 30/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / label mismatches (table labeling vs. “true” Table 1)

**Mismatch A — “prestg80” vs. “Occupational prestige”**
- **Generated:** `prestg80`
- **True Table 1 label:** *Occupational prestige*
- **Fix:** Relabel `prestg80` in the output table to “Occupational prestige” (or rename the variable before modeling). This is cosmetic but required to “match” the printed table.

**Mismatch B — “income_pc” vs. “Household income per capita”**
- **Generated:** `income_pc`
- **True:** *Household income per capita*
- **Fix:** Relabel `income_pc` accordingly in the table.

**Mismatch C — DV wording**
- **Generated DV:** “Number of music genres disliked” (matches)
- **No fix needed.**

### 3) Standard errors: generated vs. true

**Core discrepancy:**  
- **Generated table1_style prints a second line under coefficients that looks like standard errors**, but:
  1) the “True Results” explicitly state the PDF Table 1 **does not report standard errors**, and  
  2) your “standard errors” in the printed table are not labeled and don’t correspond to anything in the True table.

**Fix options (choose one):**
1) **To match the PDF Table 1:** remove SEs entirely and print **only standardized coefficients + stars**.  
2) If you must show SEs, you must obtain them from the underlying regression output used by the paper (not from Table 1). Then your “true” benchmark must include SEs too—right now it does not.

---

### 4) Significance-star / interpretation mismatches

Because the coefficients differ (and your N differs drastically), **p-values and stars diverge**. Specific star mismatches:

- **Model 2 female**
  - Generated: p≈.062 → **no star**
  - True: **\***  
  - Fix: reproduce correct sample + model specification so p-value aligns.
- **Model 2 southern**
  - Generated: p≈.061 → **no star**
  - True: **\*\***  
- **Model 3 education**
  - Generated: * (p≈.024)
  - True: ** (p<.01)
- **Model 3 age**
  - Generated: ns
  - True: *
- **Model 3 southern**
  - Generated: ns
  - True: **
- **Model 3 political intolerance**
  - Generated: ** (p≈.0016)
  - True: *** (p<.001)

**Fix:** once coefficients/N match, reapply the *paper’s* star thresholds (two-tailed: .05/.01/.001). Also ensure you are using **two-tailed p-values**.

---

### 5) The biggest structural cause: your estimation samples (N) do not match the paper

Your Ns are far smaller, especially Model 2 and 3:

- **True N:** 787 / 756 / 503  
- **Generated N:** 758 / 523 / 293  

This alone will change coefficients, SEs, p-values, R², and even signs.

**Why your N collapses (visible in your own diagnostics):**
- `hispanic` has **281 missing** (612 nonmissing out of 893 DV-complete), so listwise deletion nukes Model 2+.
- `political_intolerance` has **402 missing** (491 nonmissing), collapsing Model 3 further.
- You are doing **listwise deletion on the constructed variables as you coded them**, which likely does not match the paper’s recoding and missing-data rules.

**Fix to match the paper:**
1) **Replicate the paper’s recodes and missing-value handling exactly.** Common issues:
   - Some survey codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) should be recoded to missing before analysis—or sometimes *not* treated as missing depending on the item.
   - Ethnicity/race: the paper may construct *Hispanic* from a different source variable or treat missing as 0 in a specific way (not recommended generally, but sometimes done).
2) **Use the same inclusion rule for the DV sample.** Your diagnostics show “N_complete_music_18 = 893”, but the paper’s Model 1 N is 787, implying the paper likely:
   - restricts to a different year/subsample,
   - applies additional filters (e.g., valid responses to the full set of genre questions, age restriction, etc.),
   - or uses weights/design restrictions.
3) **Check whether the paper uses survey weights or design corrections.** Weighted vs unweighted OLS can change standardized coefficients and fit.
4) **Do not silently listwise-delete on constructed dummies if the paper didn’t.** If the paper kept cases with missing on (say) religion by using a missing category, your listwise deletion would be too strict.

---

### 6) Standardization method mismatch (likely) + constant mismatch

The paper prints **standardized coefficients**, but your approach appears to compute `beta_std` while still reporting an unstandardized **constant**.

Two common ways to get standardized betas:
1) **Standardize X and Y (z-scores) and run OLS** → intercept should be ~0.
2) **Run OLS on raw variables and post-hoc standardize**: β* = β_unstd × (sd(X)/sd(Y)) → intercept remains in raw units.

In the paper’s table, the constant is in **raw DV units**, consistent with method (2). That’s fine—*if* your β* are computed from the same unstandardized regression on the same sample and scaling.

**But your constants differ a lot** (e.g., Model 2: 10.084 vs 8.507), which again points to **different sample and/or different coding/scaling**.

**Fix:**
- Confirm you are using the **same standardization convention as the paper**. To mimic typical published “standardized OLS coefficients” tables:
  - Fit OLS on the **raw variables** on the paper’s analysis sample.
  - Compute standardized betas post-estimation: `beta_std = b * sd(x)/sd(y)` using the **same estimation sample**.
- Ensure the intercept is the raw-unit intercept from that same regression.

### 7) Interpretation mismatch (what the generated analysis implies vs what the true table implies)

Even without your narrative text, the generated results would lead to different substantive claims in at least these places:

- **Education effect (Model 2) is much stronger in generated (-0.302) than true (-0.246)** → overstates the role of education once demographics are included.
- **Income effect (Model 3) generated is moderately negative (-0.067) but true is near-zero (-0.009)** → generated implies SES still matters net of intolerance; true implies income basically drops out.
- **Southern and age effects are weaker/insignificant in generated but significant in true** → generated would understate regional and age patterning.
- **Conservative Protestant sign flips in Model 3 (generated negative, true positive)** → generated would suggest conservative Protestants dislike fewer genres net of intolerance; true suggests the opposite (though not necessarily significant—still, sign mismatch is a major interpretive error).
- **Political intolerance effect is larger in generated (0.196) but the paper reports 0.164***:** generated overstates magnitude but understates significance (because your N is too small).

**Fix:** Do not interpret any coefficient until (a) sample, (b) recodes, (c) weighting/design, and (d) standardization replicate the paper.

## Concrete “to-do” checklist to make generated match true

1) **Recreate the paper’s analytic sample sizes (787/756/503)**  
   - Identify every filter the paper applied (year, age, valid genre battery, etc.).
2) **Recode missing values exactly as the paper does** for:
   - Hispanic, religion, political intolerance, income, prestige, education.
3) **Construct race/ethnicity dummies to match the paper’s definitions** (especially “Hispanic”).
4) **Apply weights if the paper uses them** (and compute standardized betas in the weighted sample).
5) **Compute standardized coefficients using the same method** (prefer: unstandardized OLS + post-hoc beta standardization).
6) **Print the table in the same format**:
   - standardized coefficients only (no SEs), correct stars, correct variable labels, constants, R², Adj R², N.

If you share (a) the code used to build `hispanic`, `political_intolerance`, and the sample restriction for “music_18”, I can pinpoint exactly which recode/filter is driving the N collapse and the sign flips.
