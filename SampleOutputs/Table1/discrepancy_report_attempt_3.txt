Score: 20/100
============================================================

Below is an item-by-item audit of **every place the Generated Results diverge from the True Results** (Table 1 from the PDF), plus what you must change so the generated analysis matches the printed table.

---

## 1) Fit statistics: **N, R², Adjusted R² are wrong for Models 2–3 (and N is also wrong for Model 1)**

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Generated N:** 793  
  **True N:** 787  → **Mismatch**
- **Generated R²:** 0.107613  
  **True R²:** 0.107  → close (rounding OK)
- **Generated Adj R²:** 0.10422  
  **True Adj R²:** 0.104 → close (rounding OK)

**Fix**
- Ensure the analytic sample is restricted exactly as in the paper. Your missingness tables show missing in `inc_pc`, `prestg80`, `educ`, so Model 1 should be **listwise deletion across those predictors + DV** yielding **787**, not 793.
- Concretely: verify you are using the same DV (see Section 5) and applying listwise deletion with the same variable coding and missing-value rules as the authors.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Generated N:** 37  
  **True N:** 756  → **Massive mismatch**
- **Generated R²:** 0.449240  
  **True R²:** 0.151 → **Mismatch**
- **Generated Adj R²:** 0.29188  
  **True Adj R²:** 0.139 → **Mismatch**

**Fix**
- Your missingness output shows `hispanic` is missing for **836 cases (93.6%)**, which is not plausible if the published model has N=756. This indicates you have **coded `hispanic` incorrectly** (e.g., creating it as 1 for Hispanic and NA for everyone else instead of 0/1), or you are using a variable that is mostly missing.
- Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies so that **non-Hispanic respondents are coded 0, not NA**. Example rule:
  - `hispanic = 1` if Hispanic, else `0`
  - `black = 1` if Black non-Hispanic, else `0`
  - `other_race = 1` if other non-Hispanic, else `0`
  - (White is the omitted reference)
- After fixing coding, rerun with listwise deletion; N should be near **756**, and R² should drop to ~**0.151**.

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Generated N:** 19  
  **True N:** 503 → **Massive mismatch**
- **Generated R²:** 0.470050  
  **True R²:** 0.169 → **Mismatch**
- **Generated Adj R²:** -0.05990  
  **True Adj R²:** 0.148 → **Mismatch**

**Fix**
- Your missingness shows `polintol` missing for **402 cases (45%)**, and `hispanic` missing for 836 cases. Together these are collapsing N to **19** after listwise deletion.
- Fix `polintol` construction and missing coding. Common failure modes:
  - summing items but setting result to NA if *any* component item is NA (instead of requiring a minimum number of answered items or using mean of nonmissing),
  - reverse-coding mistakes producing invalid values that you then set to missing,
  - using the wrong source variable with lots of missingness.
- After correcting `hispanic` and `polintol`, listwise deletion should yield **N=503** and R² ≈ **0.169**.

---

## 2) Standardized coefficients (“betas”): **almost all are wrong in Models 2 and 3, and several are off in Model 1**

The True Results are **standardized coefficients**. Your `table1_style_betas` should match those betas.

### Model 1 (SES) betas
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.330*** | -0.322*** | close (minor) |
| inc_pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | close (minor) |
| prestg80 | 0.029 | 0.016 | **Mismatch** (direction same, magnitude off) |
| constant | 10.833*** | 10.920 | **Mismatch** (and significance shouldn’t be shown in Table 1) |

**Fix**
- If the DV and predictors are correct, these should match closely. The `prestg80` gap suggests either:
  - prestige variable not identical (different year scale, different coding), or
  - your standardization differs from the paper (e.g., you standardized using a different sample than the model’s listwise sample).
- Standardize using the **model estimation sample** (after listwise deletion), not the full dataset.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic) betas
Almost everything diverges.

Key examples:
- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.831**  
  - True: **-0.246***  
  → **Huge mismatch**
- **Age**
  - Generated: **-0.058**  
  - True: **+0.140***  
  → **Wrong sign and magnitude**
- **Female**
  - Generated: **+0.078**  
  - True: **-0.083***  
  → **Wrong sign**
- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.200**  
  - True: **0.097** **  
  → **Magnitude mismatch**
- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **0.394***  
  - True: **-0.006**  
  → **Wrong sign and magnitude**

**Fix**
These extreme discrepancies are not “rounding”—they are almost certainly caused by one (or more) of:

1) **N collapsing to 37** (unstable estimates and different sample)  
   - Fix dummy coding and missingness as above so N=756.

2) **Variables not coded the same direction**
   - `female`: in the paper, “female” effect is negative. If yours is positive, your coding may be **male=1** labeled as female, or the DV direction is reversed.
   - `age`: sign flip suggests either reversed DV or age miscoded (e.g., cohort categories, or “youngness”).

3) **Wrong DV** (see Section 5): if the outcome is not “number of music genres disliked,” all betas can shift.

Once sample + coding + DV match, the standardized betas should align with:
- educ -0.246***, inc_pc -0.054, prestg80 -0.006, female -0.083*, age +0.140***, black +0.029, hispanic -0.029, other_race +0.005, conserv_prot +0.059, no_religion -0.012, south +0.097**.

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance) betas
Again, most are wrong.

Examples:
- **polintol**
  - Generated: **0.498**  
  - True: **0.164***  
  → **Mismatch**
- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.380**  
  - True: **-0.151** **  
  → **Mismatch**
- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.005**  
  - True: **0.110***  
  → **Mismatch**
- **Female**
  - Generated: **0.224**  
  - True: **-0.095***  
  → **Wrong sign**

**Fix**
- Same root causes as Model 2, plus the `polintol` missingness/coding issue. Get N to 503 and rebuild `polintol` to match the paper’s scale. Then recompute **standardized** coefficients.

---

## 3) Coefficients vs. what Table 1 reports: you are mixing **raw coefficients** with a table that should be **standardized**

- The True Table 1 prints **standardized coefficients only**.
- Your output includes:
  - `coef_raw` (unstandardized), `se_raw`, `t_raw`, etc.
  - A separate `beta_std`.
- But your “table1_style_betas” includes constants like **10.833*** and **9.336**, which are **raw intercepts** (and you even attach stars), while Table 1 prints constants **without stars** and the betas for predictors.

**Fix**
- To match the PDF table:
  1) Report **standardized coefficients for predictors**.
  2) Report the **constant as printed** (unstandardized) but **do not add significance stars** if the table doesn’t.
  3) Do **not** claim standard errors exist for Table 1 (they aren’t printed). If you want SEs, you must source them elsewhere (appendix, replication code) or explicitly state they are from your own re-estimation.

---

## 4) Variable name/content mismatches and dummy-variable construction problems

### `hispanic` and `other_race` producing NaNs/zeros
In `coefficients_long`:
- Model 2: `hispanic` coef ~ -6e-16 with tiny SE; `other_race` coef = 0, SE=0, t=NaN
- Model 3: similar pathologies

This is consistent with:
- a dummy that is **all missing**, **all zero**, or **perfectly collinear**, often due to incorrect coding.

**Fix**
- Ensure each dummy has variation in the estimation sample.
- Ensure you omit exactly one race category as reference.
- Ensure you are not including both a “hispanic” indicator and a “race including Hispanic as category” dummy set in a collinear way.

---

## 5) Interpretation / DV alignment: likely wrong outcome or reversed scale

True DV: **Number of music genres disliked**.

Your generated materials never explicitly label the DV, but the models include a constant around ~10 in Models 1–2 and -8 in Model 3, and the signs on gender/age are inconsistent with the published standardized effects.

**Fix**
- Verify the dependent variable is exactly the count used in the paper (same genre list, same handling of “don’t know,” same exclusions).
- Ensure higher values mean “more genres disliked” (not “liked,” not reverse coded).
- Recompute the DV before modeling and confirm its distribution roughly matches what would yield constants like ~10.9, 8.507, 6.516 in the three models (as printed).

---

## 6) Significance stars and p-values: cannot be validated from Table 1, and your stars don’t match the published ones

Examples:
- Model 2 education: Generated `**` (p≈.001) but True is `***`.
- Model 3 polintol: Generated not significant (p≈.359) but True is `***`.

**Fix**
- You cannot “force” p-values to match unless you replicate:
  - identical sample,
  - identical variable construction,
  - identical weights (if any),
  - identical SE method (robust/clustered?) used by the authors.
- First fix the **sample/coding** issues that are collapsing N. Once N matches, the significance will likely move toward the printed stars.
- Also ensure you are using the same **two-tailed thresholds** as the paper (*<.05, **<.01, ***<.001). You are, but the underlying model is not comparable yet.

---

## 7) What to change (action checklist to make Generated match True)

1) **Recreate all predictors exactly as in the paper**
   - Education scale as used in Table 1
   - Household income per capita (`inc_pc`) constructed identically (equivalized? per capita? inflation-adjusted?)
   - Prestige (`prestg80`) from the correct prestige measure and year
   - `female` coded 1=female, 0=male
   - Race/ethnicity dummies: **0/1 with 0 for “not that group,” not NA**
   - Religion dummies (`conserv_prot`, `no_religion`) coded 0/1 with correct reference
   - `south` coded 0/1
   - `polintol` scale constructed to match the paper (and missing handled properly)

2) **Fix missingness so listwise N matches**
   - Target N: Model1=787, Model2=756, Model3=503
   - Your current N=37 and N=19 indicate dummy/scale construction errors (especially `hispanic`, `polintol`).

3) **Compute standardized coefficients correctly**
   - Standardize using the **estimation sample for that model**.
   - Confirm the reported betas equal the table values to 3 decimals.

4) **Output formatting**
   - Table 1 should show **standardized betas only** (no SEs).
   - Constants should match printed constants and typically are shown without stars (as in the PDF).

If you paste (a) your variable construction code (especially for `hispanic`, race dummies, and `polintol`) and (b) the regression formulae you used for each model, I can pinpoint the exact coding line(s) causing the N collapse and the sign flips.
