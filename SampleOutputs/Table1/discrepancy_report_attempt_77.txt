============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True (Table 1) Results**, plus what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the table.

---

## 1) Fit statistics and sample sizes: major mismatches

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your Model 1 estimation sample is too small. Ensure you’re using the same missing-data rule as the paper/table. Most likely you are doing listwise deletion on variables that Table 1 did not require (or you used additional filters/subsetting). Recreate the Model 1 analytic sample using *only* the DV and Model 1 predictors.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, **Adj R² = 0.085**
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, **Adj R² = 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample and variable construction match Table 1, R² should move toward the published values. The current R² discrepancy is consistent with the wrong sample and/or wrong variable coding.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **43**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is not a small discrepancy—it indicates you accidentally restricted to a tiny subset. The generated missingness table shows **Hispanic is 93% missing**, which is not plausible for a GSS race/ethnicity indicator and would indeed destroy N. This is almost certainly a **variable mismatch** (wrong source variable) or mis-coded missing values.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.462**, **Adj R² = 0.293**
  - True: **R² = 0.151**, **Adj R² = 0.139**
  - **Fix:** With N=43 and likely severe collinearity/separation (and dropped predictors), your fit stats are meaningless relative to the table. Fix the sample/variables first; then recompute.

- **Dropped predictors**
  - Generated: “**otherrace**” dropped
  - True: **Other race is included** (β = 0.005)
  - **Fix:** “Dropped” happens because within your (wrong) tiny sample **otherrace has zero variance** (you show mean=0, sd=0). With correct coding and full sample, it won’t be dropped.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **23**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Same root problem as Model 2, plus you’re also requiring `pol_intol` (47% missing in your data). But even with that, N should not collapse to 23 if variables are correct and coded like the paper.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.657**, **Adj R² = 0.372**
  - True: **R² = 0.169**, **Adj R² = 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Again driven by the wrong estimation sample and dropped predictors (Hispanic/Other race are NaN).

---

## 2) Variable name/coding problems (root cause)

### Hispanic variable is clearly wrong
- Generated missingness: **hispanic nonmissing = 108 / 1606 (93.3% missing)**
- In Model 2 sample, **black mean = 0.953** (i.e., 95% Black!), and otherrace is all zeros.
- This strongly suggests:
  1) you used an **incorrect “hispanic” field** (maybe a text code, a different year’s variable, or a recode with most values set to missing),
  2) you treated valid category codes as missing (e.g., GSS uses special codes like 8/9/0 for DK/NA; but Hispanic is often not coded as a simple 0/1 in older waves), and/or
  3) you merged or filtered incorrectly (e.g., accidentally keeping only a tiny subgroup).

**Fix (conceptual):**
- Verify you are using the **same GSS 1993 variables** the paper used.
- Recode race/ethnicity indicators correctly:
  - Ensure **Black / Hispanic / Other race** are mutually exclusive dummies derived from the same base race/ethnicity info (and that “white” is the reference).
  - Ensure missing codes (DK/NA) are set to NA, but **valid categories are not**.

### Political intolerance variable mismatch / missingness too high
- Generated `pol_intol` is **47% missing** and the final Model 3 N is **23**.
- True Model 3 N is **503**, so the table’s political intolerance measure must have far more valid cases than what you constructed.

**Fix:**
- Confirm you used the same **political intolerance index construction (0–15)** and the same inclusion rules (e.g., how many items required, whether “don’t know” is handled as missing, whether partial indices are allowed, etc.).
- If you created `pol_intol` by summing items, you may be requiring complete non-missingness on all items; the paper may allow partial completion or uses a different set of items.

## 3) Coefficients (β) mismatches everywhere

Important: **True Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)**, while your “full” models show both **b and beta**; your “table1style” appears to report **beta**. So comparisons should use your **beta** column / table1style values.

### Model 1 (SES): mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | wrong magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close but not exact |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | wrong magnitude |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | wrong |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | wrong |
| N | **747** | **787** | wrong |

**Fix:** Use the correct sample (N=787) and ensure the DV and predictors are coded/scaled identically. Standardization method can also cause small differences (see section 5).

### Model 2 (Demographic): mismatches (direction/significance often wrong)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.730** ** | **-0.246*** | wildly wrong size; stars wrong |
| Income pc | **0.109** | **-0.054** | wrong sign |
| Prestige | **0.406*** | **-0.006** | wrong sign and size |
| Female | **0.079** | **-0.083*** | wrong sign |
| Age | **0.021** | **0.140*** | wrong magnitude + stars |
| Black | **-0.014** | **0.029** | wrong sign |
| Hispanic | **-0.020** | **-0.029** | close-ish but your model has catastrophic missingness |
| Other race | blank/dropped | **0.005** | missing |
| Cons Prot | **0.422*** | **0.059** | hugely wrong |
| No religion | **0.151** | **-0.012** | wrong sign |
| Southern | **0.165** | **0.097** ** | magnitude/stars wrong |
| Constant | **8.975** | **8.507** | wrong |
| R² | **0.462** | **0.151** | wrong |
| N | **43** | **756** | wrong |

**Fix:** This is not “small computational drift”; it’s a different dataset/subsample/coding. Fix the Hispanic/race variables and the unintended sample restriction first.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): mismatches (plus missing predictors)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.043** | **-0.151** ** | wrong |
| Income pc | **-0.132** | **-0.009** | wrong magnitude |
| Prestige | **0.332** | **-0.022** | wrong sign |
| Female | **0.288** | **-0.095*** | wrong sign |
| Age | **0.329** | **0.110*** | wrong magnitude |
| Black | **-0.190** | **0.049** | wrong sign |
| Hispanic | missing/dropped | **0.031** | missing |
| Other race | missing/dropped | **0.053** | missing |
| Cons Prot | **0.693** ** | **0.066** | wrong |
| No religion | **0.291** | **0.024** | wrong magnitude |
| Southern | **0.267** | **0.121** ** | wrong |
| Political intolerance | **0.221** | **0.164*** | wrong magnitude/stars |
| Constant | **-4.545** | **6.516** | drastically wrong |
| R² | **0.657** | **0.169** | wrong |
| N | **23** | **503** | wrong |

**Fix:** Again: wrong sample + wrong coding. Also, with N=23, coefficients are unstable and not comparable.

## 4) Standard errors / p-values: interpretation mismatch with the “True results”

- **True Table 1**: **does not report standard errors**; it reports **standardized coefficients with stars**.
- **Generated output**: reports **p-values** and stars derived from those p-values.

This creates two issues:
1) You can’t “match” SEs to Table 1 because they are not provided.
2) Even if coefficients match, your **stars may differ** if:
   - you are using a different N,
   - different missingness handling,
   - different robust/cluster SE choice,
   - different weighting/design corrections (GSS often uses weights; some analyses use them, some don’t),
   - or different two-tailed thresholds (though your thresholds match the note).

**Fix:**
- For “matching Table 1,” suppress SE output (or show them but note “not in Table 1”).
- Ensure stars are computed the same way as the paper (almost surely conventional OLS p-values, two-tailed), and ensure the estimation sample matches.

---

## 5) Likely technical reasons your β values won’t match even after recoding (secondary issues)

Even with correct sample/variables, standardized coefficients can differ if:
- You standardized using **sample SD vs population SD** (ddof=1 vs ddof=0).
- You standardized using **the model estimation sample** vs **full-sample SDs**.
- You standardized the DV as well (β computation typically implies all variables standardized; software differs).
- You used **weights** (standardization under weights changes SDs).

**Fix:**
- Compute standardized coefficients in the same way the source table did. The safest replication approach:
  - Restrict to the exact model’s listwise-complete cases.
  - Standardize X’s and Y using **that analytic sample** (and if weights are used, use weighted means/SDs).
  - Fit OLS on standardized variables to get β directly (constant will be ~0 then; but Table 1 keeps an unstandardized constant, so instead compute β post hoc from unstandardized model: β = b * (SDx/SDy) using the same SD definitions).

---

## 6) The “dropped predictors / NaN coefficients” problem

- Generated Model 2: `Other race` is NaN.
- Generated Model 3: `Hispanic` and `Other race` are NaN.
- Your own sample descriptives show **otherrace has sd=0**, and **hispanic has sd=0** in Model 3.

**Fix:**
- Correct the construction of these race dummies and ensure you’re not subsetting to a group where those categories never occur.
- Ensure you aren’t mistakenly filtering to, e.g., only Black respondents (your Model 2 sample is 95% Black).

---

## 7) What to change in the generated analysis so it matches Table 1 (action checklist)

1) **Rebuild the analytic samples**
   - Model 1 should be listwise complete on: `num_genres_disliked`, `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v` → target **N≈787**.
   - Model 2 adds: `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south` → target **N≈756**.
   - Model 3 adds: `pol_intol` → target **N≈503**.

2) **Fix Hispanic / race coding**
   - Audit raw frequency tables before recoding.
   - Ensure missing codes are handled correctly.
   - Ensure categories are not accidentally converted to NA.

3) **Fix political intolerance index construction**
   - Verify item set, scoring direction, and missing-data rule to achieve ~503 cases.

4) **Ensure you are reporting the same metric**
   - Table 1 uses **standardized coefficients (β)**.
   - Your combined table should display **β**, not b.
   - Constants should be **unstandardized** (as in Table 1).

5) **Confirm weights and standardization conventions**
   - If the paper used weights, use them.
   - Match the β computation method (SD definitions, analytic-sample SDs).

6) **Recompute stars**
   - Two-tailed p-values with the correct df (N-k-1) on the correct sample.

If you paste the code (or at least: how you constructed `hispanic`, `otherrace`, and `pol_intol`, and how you subset to “GSS 1993”), I can point to the exact line(s) causing N to collapse to 43/23 and propose a corrected recode that should bring N and coefficients in line with Table 1.
