## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is missing in the generated models (Models 2 & 3)**
- **True Table 1 includes:** `Hispanic` in Demographic and Political Intolerance models.
- **Generated results:** explicitly state “Hispanic not included,” and there is no Hispanic row in Model 2 or Model 3.

**Why this is a mismatch**
- It changes the model specification, affects *all* other coefficients (omitted-variable bias and reallocation of explained variance), and changes N due to listwise deletion.

**How to fix**
- Construct and include a `hispanic` dummy exactly as in the original study.
  - Typical GSS-style coding: a respondent is “Hispanic” if `hispanic`/`ethnic` indicator is yes, regardless of race (depends on the dataset’s scheme).
  - Ensure the reference category matches the paper (usually White non-Hispanic as baseline with separate dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race).
- Re-run Model 2 and Model 3 with `hispanic` included.

---

### B. **Coefficient table mixes standardized and unstandardized outputs (and labels)**
- **True Table 1:** “Standardized OLS coefficients” (betas). **No SEs printed.**
- **Generated table1_style:** prints a coefficient line and then another numeric line that *looks like a standard error*, but Table 1 in the PDF *does not contain SEs*.

**Why this is a mismatch**
- Even if your betas were correct, presenting SEs implies they came from the PDF table; they didn’t. Also, the table visually suggests those SEs correspond to the displayed coefficients, which is not “matching” the true output.

**How to fix**
- Either:
  1) **Match the PDF:** print standardized coefficients only and remove SE rows entirely; or  
  2) If you want SEs, compute them from the microdata and clearly label the table as “replication results (SEs computed from data),” not “as printed.”

## 2) Sample size (N) mismatches (listwise deletion/spec mismatch)

### Model 1 N
- **Generated:** N = **748**
- **True:** N = **787**
- **Mismatch:** -39 cases.

### Model 2 N
- **Generated:** N = **698**
- **True:** N = **756**
- **Mismatch:** -58 cases.

### Model 3 N
- **Generated:** N = **395**
- **True:** N = **503**
- **Mismatch:** -108 cases.

**Likely causes**
1) **Overly strict DV construction / complete-case rule.**  
   Generated diagnostics say: “strict complete-case across 18 music items; dislike=4/5; sum to 0–18.”  
   The paper’s DV may not require complete responses on all 18 items (could allow partial completion or use different missing handling).
2) **Overly strict political intolerance scale completion.**  
   Generated says complete-case across 15 tolerance items. The paper’s N=503 suggests less strict missingness handling or different item set.
3) **Missing Hispanic caused extra listwise loss** (Models 2/3 would *increase* missingness if constructed badly; but here Hispanic is absent, so it’s not the direct cause of smaller N—still, the *overall* missing rules are likely not aligned).

**How to fix**
- Reproduce the paper’s exact inclusion rule:
  - Verify the DV coding rules from the methods/appendix:  
    - Are “don’t know/refused/not asked” treated as missing?  
    - Do they require all 18 items answered, or do they compute the count over non-missing items (possibly with rescaling)?
  - For political intolerance: confirm the exact items (15?), and whether the scale is computed if at least *k* items are present rather than all.
- Once the missing-data rules match, N should move toward 787/756/503.

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **standardized coefficient** differences (Generated β vs True β). Since the true table reports standardized coefficients only, this is the correct comparison metric.

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Education:** Gen -0.310 vs True -0.322 → mismatch (0.012)
- **Income pc:** Gen -0.038 vs True -0.037 → close (0.001)
- **Prestige:** Gen +0.025 vs True +0.016 → mismatch (0.009)
- **Constant:** Gen 10.848 vs True 10.920 → mismatch
- **R²:** Gen 0.097 vs True 0.107 → mismatch
- **Adj R²:** Gen 0.094 vs True 0.104 → mismatch

**Fix**
- Once you match N and DV construction, these should move. The prestige sign/size discrepancy suggests either:
  - different prestige variable (e.g., `prestg80` vs another prestige measure), or
  - different sample restrictions/weights.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
Key mismatches:
- **Education:** Gen -0.245 vs True -0.246 → basically matches
- **Income pc:** Gen -0.042 vs True -0.054 → mismatch
- **Prestige:** Gen +0.005 vs True -0.006 → sign mismatch
- **Female:** Gen -0.073 vs True -0.083 → mismatch
- **Age:** Gen +0.101 vs True +0.140 → mismatch (large)
- **Black:** Gen +0.033 vs True +0.029 → close
- **Other race:** Gen +0.004 vs True +0.005 → close
- **Conservative Protestant:** Gen +0.086 vs True +0.059 → mismatch (and significance differs: Gen has *, True has none)
- **No religion:** Gen -0.005 vs True -0.012 → mismatch
- **Southern:** Gen +0.068 vs True +0.097 → mismatch (and significance differs: Gen none, True **)
- **Hispanic:** missing entirely → major mismatch
- **Constant / R² / Adj R² / N:** all mismatched (Gen const 8.767 vs True 8.507; Gen R² 0.124 vs True 0.151; Gen N 698 vs True 756)

**Fix**
- Add Hispanic dummy and ensure race/ethnicity reference categories match.
- Confirm `age` is coded identically (years? centered? top-coded?).
- Ensure religion coding matches (Conservative Protestant definition often requires denomination mapping).
- Fix DV and missing rules to recover N and raise R² toward 0.151.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
Mismatches:
- **Education:** Gen -0.153 (sig *) vs True -0.151 (sig **) → coefficient close, **significance mismatch**
- **Income pc:** Gen -0.012 vs True -0.009 → close
- **Prestige:** Gen -0.009 vs True -0.022 → mismatch
- **Female:** Gen -0.097 vs True -0.095 → close
- **Age:** Gen +0.038 vs True +0.110 → large mismatch (and significance differs: Gen ns, True *)
- **Black:** Gen +0.076 vs True +0.049 → mismatch
- **Other race:** Gen +0.057 vs True +0.053 → close
- **Conservative Protestant:** Gen +0.077 vs True +0.066 → small mismatch
- **No religion:** Gen +0.017 vs True +0.024 → mismatch
- **Southern:** Gen +0.066 vs True +0.121 → large mismatch (and significance differs: Gen ns, True **)
- **Political intolerance:** Gen +0.148 (**) vs True +0.164 (***) → mismatch and significance mismatch
- **Hispanic:** missing entirely → major mismatch
- **Constant / R² / Adj R² / N:** all mismatched (Gen const 7.498 vs True 6.516; Gen R² 0.122 vs True 0.169; Gen N 395 vs True 503)

**Fix**
- Biggest driver is again **sample definition** (N way too small) and **omitted Hispanic**.
- Rebuild political intolerance scale to match the paper (items, coding, and missing handling). Your note says “sum of 15 intolerance indicators (0..15).” If the paper uses a different coding (e.g., mean scale, different set of targets, or different threshold for “intolerant”), coefficients and N will shift.

---

## 4) Standard errors: direct mismatches cannot be assessed against “true” Table 1
- **True Table 1:** does **not** report SEs.
- **Generated:** shows SE-like numbers in the formatted table, and also includes unstandardized `b_raw` and p-values.

**Mismatch type**
- Not a numeric mismatch (because no true SEs exist there), but a **reporting/attribution mismatch**: you can’t claim they match the printed table.

**Fix**
- Remove SEs from the “as printed” comparison table.
- If you want a replication-with-SEs table, label it as such and compare only the standardized betas to Table 1.

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Because N and model spec differ, p-values/stars differ. Concrete cases:

- **Model 3 Education:** Gen `*` vs True `**`
- **Model 2 Conservative Protestant:** Gen `*` vs True none
- **Model 2 Southern:** Gen none (p≈0.065) vs True `**`
- **Model 3 Political intolerance:** Gen `**` vs True `***`

**Fix**
- Once you align (a) the sample, (b) the DV/scale construction, (c) inclusion of Hispanic, and (d) any weighting/robust-SE choices used in the original, the standard errors and thus stars should converge.

---

## 6) What you need to change so the generated analysis matches the true table (checklist)

1) **Recreate variables exactly as the paper**
   - DV “# music genres disliked”: confirm exact items (18?), the “dislike” threshold, and missing rule.
   - `political_intolerance`: confirm item list, coding, and whether it’s a sum/mean.
   - `hispanic` dummy: must be included in Models 2 & 3.
   - Religion categories: verify “Conservative Protestant” mapping matches theirs.
   - Region: confirm “Southern” definition.

2) **Match estimation approach**
   - Are weights used in the original? (Common in survey data; affects coefficients if the model is weighted.)
   - Are betas computed from weighted SDs or unweighted?
   - Are SEs robust/clustered? (Even though Table 1 doesn’t show SEs, it affects stars if you replicate.)

3) **Match sample selection**
   - The paper’s N is higher in every model; your complete-case rules are likely too strict.
   - Implement the paper’s missing handling so you recover **787 / 756 / 503**.

4) **Output formatting**
   - To match “true results,” print **standardized coefficients only** (no SE rows), include Hispanic, and report R²/Adj R²/N as in the table.

If you share the code (or at least the exact variable construction steps for the DV and political intolerance scale), I can point to the exact lines that are causing the N drop and coefficient drift.
