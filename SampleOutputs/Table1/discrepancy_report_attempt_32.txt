## 1) Fit statistics: n, R², adjusted R², and “dropped” variables

### Mismatches
- **Sample sizes (n) are wrong in all generated models**
  - Generated: Model 1 **747**, Model 2 **43**, Model 3 **27**
  - True: Model 1 **787**, Model 2 **756**, Model 3 **503**
- **R² / adjusted R² are wrong in all generated models**
  - Generated: M1 **0.088/0.085**, M2 **0.430/0.252**, M3 **0.465/0.131**
  - True: M1 **0.107/0.104**, M2 **0.151/0.139**, M3 **0.169/0.148**
- **“dropped” predictors appear (hispanic/otherrace) in generated output but should not be dropped**
  - True table includes **Black, Hispanic, Other race** in Models 2–3 with nonzero coefficients.

### Likely cause
- You are fitting models on a dataset with **massive missingness** in race indicators (your missingness table shows ~93% missing for black/hispanic/otherrace), causing:
  - near-total case deletion in models with those variables (hence n=43, 27),
  - singularities/collinearity leading to NaN estimates (“dropped”),
  - wildly inflated R² due to tiny analytic samples.

### How to fix
- **Fix the construction of race dummy variables**. In GSS-style data, race is usually a single categorical variable (e.g., `race` with levels White/Black/Other). Your `black/hispanic/otherrace` appear to be incorrectly created or merged, leaving most cases missing.
  - Recreate race indicators from the original race/ethnicity fields, e.g.:
    - `black = 1[race==Black] else 0`
    - `otherrace = 1[race==Other] else 0`
    - `hispanic = 1[ethnic/hispanic==Yes] else 0` (depending on how the paper defined it)
  - Ensure **0/1 values for everyone**, not NA for non-members.
- **Use the same case base as the paper**:
  - Model 1 should use complete cases on: education, income pc, prestige (n≈787).
  - Model 2 adds demographics (n≈756).
  - Model 3 adds political intolerance (n≈503).
- If you’re reproducing a *published table*, you may need **listwise deletion consistent with the paper** (and the same variable coding), not arbitrary NA propagation from bad dummy coding.

---

## 2) Variable names / included predictors

### Mismatches
- Generated labels differ slightly (OK), but substantively:
  - Generated Model 3 uses **Political intolerance (0–15)** which matches conceptually.
  - The **problem is not inclusion**, it’s that **Hispanic and Other race are missing/dropped** (NaN) in Models 2–3, but they exist in the true results.

### How to fix
- Once the race/ethnicity variables are correctly coded (no 93% missing), those terms should estimate normally and will no longer be dropped.

---

## 3) Coefficients: sign, magnitude, and standardized vs unstandardized

### Core mismatch: you mixed up coefficient types
- **True Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors, and **unstandardized constants**.
- Your generated output includes both:
  - `b` (unstandardized slope) and
  - `beta` (standardized),
  but then your “Table1style” tables appear to **report beta values** (good in intent) **but they do not match the true βs**.

Additionally, several **signs** are wrong relative to the true table, which is not explainable by standardization alone.

---

## 4) Model-by-model coefficient mismatches (Generated β vs True β)

Below I compare the **generated standardized beta** (“beta” / Table1style) to the **true Table 1 β**.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | magnitude off |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (minor) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | minor |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | wrong |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | wrong |
| n | **747** | **787** | wrong |

**Fix:** once the analytic sample matches (n≈787) and variables are coded identically, these should tighten up; the constant and R² discrepancies strongly indicate the wrong case base and/or wrong coding of the DV or predictors.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.751** ** | **-0.246*** | completely wrong (size + stars) |
| Income pc | **0.145** | **-0.054** | **wrong sign** |
| Prestige | **0.310** | **-0.006** | **wrong sign** |
| Female | **0.086** | **-0.083*** | **wrong sign** |
| Age | **-0.064** | **0.140*** | **wrong sign** |
| Black | **0.140** | **0.029** | too large |
| Hispanic | **0.116** | **-0.029** | wrong sign |
| Other race | (blank/NaN) | **0.005** | missing |
| Cons. Prot. | **0.346** | **0.059** | far too large |
| No religion | **0.165** | **-0.012** | wrong sign |
| Southern | **0.192** | **0.097** | too large |
| Constant | **8.165** | **8.507** | wrong |
| R² | **0.430** | **0.151** | wrong |
| n | **43** | **756** | catastrophically wrong |

**Fix:** This model is not remotely comparable because it’s being estimated on **n=43** with dropped variables. Correct race/ethnicity missingness and re-run with the correct sample. After that:
- recompute standardized β correctly (see Section 6),
- ensure dummy codings match the paper (reference categories matter for interpretation but not β signs in most cases—your sign flips indicate deeper coding/sample problems).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.391** | **-0.151** | too large |
| Income pc | **-0.116** | **-0.009** | too large |
| Prestige | **0.344** | **-0.022** | wrong sign |
| Female | **0.117** | **-0.095** | wrong sign |
| Age | **0.094** | **0.110** | close-ish |
| Black | **-0.054** | **0.049** | wrong sign |
| Hispanic | (blank/NaN) | **0.031** | missing |
| Other race | (blank/NaN) | **0.053** | missing |
| Cons. Prot. | **0.478** | **0.066** | far too large |
| No religion | **0.403** | **0.024** | far too large |
| Southern | **0.467** | **0.121** | far too large |
| Political intolerance | **0.147** | **0.164*** | somewhat close value, but stars differ |
| Constant | **2.001** | **6.516** | very wrong |
| R² | **0.465** | **0.169** | wrong |
| n | **27** | **503** | catastrophically wrong |

**Fix:** again, the model is being run on **n=27** (due to missingness propagation), so none of these are interpretable. Fix the variable missingness/coding and re-estimate with n≈503.

## 5) Standard errors and p-values: interpretation mismatch with the “true” table

### Mismatches
- Generated output reports **p-values and significance stars** derived from your (incorrect) regression.
- True results explicitly state: **Table 1 does not report standard errors**, only stars.
- Therefore:
  - you **cannot** claim SE matches/mismatches Table 1,
  - and your stars should match the paper’s stars only if you exactly replicate the model and sample.

### How to fix
- If the goal is to match the published Table 1:
  - Do **not** present standard errors as if they are “from Table 1”.
  - If you compute SEs yourself (fine), label them as **computed**, not extracted.
- Match stars by reproducing:
  - same sample restrictions,
  - same weights (if any),
  - same coding,
  - same listwise deletion rules,
  - same model form.

## 6) How to make the generated analysis match the true Table 1

### A. Rebuild the analytic samples to match n’s
1. Create Model 1 dataset: complete cases on DV + `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`. Target n≈787.
2. Model 2: add `female`, `age`, race/ethnicity dummies, religion dummies, `south`. Target n≈756.
3. Model 3: add `pol_intol`. Target n≈503.

If your n’s don’t match, inspect which variables are causing extra deletion.

### B. Fix race/ethnicity variables (critical)
Your missingness shows `black/hispanic/otherrace` are missing for almost everyone. That should not happen for dummy variables. Ensure:
- dummies are 0/1 with **no NA** except where the underlying race is missing,
- reference categories align with the paper (likely White, non-Hispanic, non–conservative Protestant, etc.).

### C. Ensure you are reporting standardized coefficients (β)
To reproduce Table 1, compute standardized betas from the *final OLS model*:
- Either fit on z-scored variables (except the constant) and read slopes,
- Or compute \( \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{\text{SD}(X_j)}{\text{SD}(Y)} \).

Then:
- Report **β** for predictors,
- Report **unstandardized constant** (as the true table does).

### D. Make sure the DV is identical
The DV is “Number of music genres disliked.” Your `num_genres_disliked` must match the paper’s construction (same genre list, same coding rules, same missing handling). A different DV construction can flip signs and shift constants/R².

### E. Check weighting and design effects
GSS analyses sometimes apply weights. If the paper used weights and you didn’t (or vice versa), R² and coefficients can differ. Confirm whether the paper used a weight variable and replicate it.

## 7) Summary of “every mismatch” at a glance

- **fit_stats:** all n, R², adj R² mismatched; “dropped” variables shouldn’t be dropped.
- **Race terms:** Hispanic/Other race are **NaN/blank** in generated but present in true.
- **Model 2 signs wrong:** income, prestige, female, age, hispanic, norelig all have wrong sign vs true.
- **Model 3 signs wrong:** prestige, female, black wrong sign; Hispanic/Other race missing; political intolerance star level differs.
- **Constants:** all constants differ substantially (especially Model 3: 2.0 vs 6.516).
- **Stars/p-values/SE:** generated inference doesn’t correspond to Table 1 (SE not reported there); stars won’t match until the model is correctly replicated.

If you share the code that creates `black/hispanic/otherrace` and the exact recodes for `num_genres_disliked` and `pol_intol`, I can point to the exact line-level causes (e.g., NA propagation, wrong reference category, wrong merges) and specify the minimal edits to reproduce the published table.
