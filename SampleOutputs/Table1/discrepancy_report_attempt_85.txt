Score: 39/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics (n, R², adjusted R²): all three models mismatch

| Model | Statistic | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| 1 | n | 747 | 787 | Different analytic sample | Use the same inclusion rules as the paper (likely listwise deletion on the *Model 1 variables only*), and confirm you’re using the same GSS 1993 subset and any weights/filters. |
| 1 | R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | Understates fit | Once sample + variable coding match the paper and you report standardized betas correctly, R² should align more closely. |
| 1 | adj R² | 0.085 | 0.104 | Understates fit | Same as above. |
| 2 | n | 507 | 756 | Major sample mismatch | You are effectively doing heavy listwise deletion (or using the wrong dataset/year/merge). Recreate the paper’s missing-data handling (almost certainly listwise on Model 2 vars) and ensure your race/region/religion variables don’t introduce extra missings. |
| 2 | R² | 0.139 | 0.151 | Too low | Will change when sample/coding/standardization match. |
| 2 | adj R² | 0.120 | 0.139 | Too low | Same. |
| 3 | n | 286 | 503 | Massive mismatch (likely due to `pol_intol` missingness) | Your `pol_intol` has ~47% missing; the paper’s Model 3 keeps 503 cases, so your intolerance measure is not constructed the same way (or is pulled from the wrong variable/year). Rebuild political intolerance exactly as in the paper and verify the correct source items and coding. |
| 3 | R² | 0.149 | 0.169 | Too low | Fix intolerance construction + sample. |
| 3 | adj R² | 0.111 | 0.148 | Too low | Same. |

**Core issue:** your *analytic samples* are not the paper’s samples, especially Model 2 and Model 3.

### 2) Constants (intercepts): all three mismatch (and Model 3 is very far off)

| Model | Generated constant | True constant | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | 10.638 | 10.920 | Intercept will change with sample and coding (and possibly weights). |
| 2 | 8.675 | 8.507 | Same. |
| 3 | 7.999 | 6.516 | This is too different to be noise—almost certainly the political intolerance variable and/or the sample definition is wrong. Reconstruct the intolerance scale and verify coding of all covariates. |

Also note: the paper’s table reports **standardized coefficients (β)** but **constants are unstandardized**. Your combined “Table1style” mixes standardized betas with an intercept from *your* model; that part is fine in principle, but only if the underlying model matches.

---

### 3) Standardized coefficients (β): many mismatches in size, sign, and significance

#### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | too small in magnitude | Sample/coding mismatch; ensure education is coded identically and that β is computed as standardized slope from the same OLS. |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | close | Probably fine once sample matches. |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | slightly high | Same. |

#### Model 2 (Demographic): several substantive errors
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch type | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | magnitude off | Sample/coding/standardization mismatch. |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | close | Likely resolves with sample alignment. |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | small diff | Same. |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close | Probably OK once sample matches. |
| **Age** | **0.103***? (shown as 0.103*) | **0.140*** | **too small + wrong stars** | Your p-values/stars are inconsistent with the paper. Fix sample and compute stars using the paper thresholds. |
| **Black** | **0.100** | **0.029** | **much too large** | Likely race coding mismatch (e.g., your “black” indicator includes others, or reference category differs). Ensure the same reference group and mutually exclusive race dummies as the paper. |
| **Hispanic** | **+0.074** | **-0.029** | **wrong sign** | Strong evidence your Hispanic dummy is coded differently (or reversed) or you are not restricting to the same population. Recode Hispanic to match the paper’s definition and make race categories consistent. |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **+0.005** | sign differs | Same race-category construction issue. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.087 | 0.059 | too large | Religion tradition coding likely differs from paper’s scheme. Recreate the exact denominational classification. |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | close | Should align after coding/sample fix. |
| **Southern** | **0.061 (ns)** | **0.097** ** | too small + missing significance | “South” coding or weighting/sample mismatch. Ensure South matches Census South as used in GSS, and apply same weights if paper did. |

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance): key coefficient wrong in magnitude and stars; plus several sign/size differences
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch type | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | stars differ | Your SE/p-values differ (sample mismatch). Also you label significance via “p_replication” which is not the paper’s p-values. Use conventional OLS p-values and thresholds. |
| **Income pc** | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | **huge discrepancy** | Income scaling/coding differs (e.g., you may be using continuous dollars vs. categorized/adjusted income; “per capita” construction may differ). Rebuild income-per-capita exactly as paper did (household income divided by household size? inflation-adjusted? top-codes?). |
| Prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | moderate | Likely resolves partially with sample. |
| Female | -0.127* | -0.095* | too large | Sample/coding. |
| Age | 0.091 (ns) | 0.110* | too small + significance differs | Sample mismatch. |
| Black | 0.060 | 0.049 | close | Might align later. |
| **Hispanic** | **-0.030** | **+0.031** | **wrong sign** | Same Hispanic coding issue as Model 2. |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches | Good. |
| Cons Prot | 0.036 | 0.066 | too small | Religion coding mismatch. |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | matches | Good. |
| **Southern** | **0.068 (ns)** | **0.121** ** | too small + stars missing | South coding/weights/sample mismatch. |
| **Political intolerance** | **0.184** ** | **0.164*** | too big + wrong stars | Your intolerance scale and/or standardization differs; plus your significance-star assignment differs. Reconstruct intolerance index exactly; verify range and items; then recompute β and stars. |

### 4) Variable-name / construct mismatches causing the coefficient problems

These aren’t just “label” problems—your *measures* likely differ:

1. **Political intolerance (0–15)**  
   - Your missingness table shows `pol_intol` is missing for **47%** of cases, collapsing Model 3 to **n=286**, while the paper has **n=503**.  
   **Fix:** Identify the exact GSS items used to build “political intolerance” in the paper, replicate the additive/scale construction, handle “don’t know/refused/not asked” the same way, and verify the resulting distribution and missingness. Your current intolerance variable is almost certainly not the same measure.

2. **Hispanic / race dummies**  
   - In both Model 2 and 3, your Hispanic coefficient sign conflicts with the paper. Black is also far larger than reported in Model 2.  
   **Fix:** Recreate mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories exactly as the paper (e.g., Hispanic treated as ethnicity overriding race vs. separate dummy; reference category likely “White non-Hispanic”). Ensure dummies are coded 0/1 with correct reference group and no overlap.

3. **Household income per capita**  
   - In Model 3 your β for income is -0.052 vs true -0.009, suggesting a different scaling/definition.  
   **Fix:** Verify: (a) what income variable is used (family income category vs. continuous), (b) how household size is defined, (c) whether per-capita is computed with equivalence scales, and (d) any transformations (log). Then standardize *after* constructing the correct measure.

4. **Religion tradition: “Conservative Protestant”**  
   - Your effects differ notably in Models 2 and 3.  
   **Fix:** Use the same denominational classification scheme as the paper (these are notoriously nontrivial in the GSS). Small coding differences materially change coefficients and missingness.

5. **Region: Southern**  
   - Your South effect is much smaller and loses significance.  
   **Fix:** Ensure South matches the paper’s region definition; check whether “South” is based on region vs. state, and whether DC/territories/unknown region are handled the same.

---

### 5) Standard errors / p-values / significance: generated output is not comparable to the “true” table

- The **true Table 1 does not report standard errors**; it reports **β and stars** only.
- Your tables show a column called **`p_replication`**, and stars derived from that. Those p-values are not the paper’s and might not even be conventional OLS p-values.
  
**Fix:**
1. Compute **standardized coefficients (β)** in the same way the paper does (typically: run OLS on standardized variables or convert from unstandardized using SDs).
2. Compute **two-tailed OLS p-values** from the same model.
3. Apply the paper’s thresholds: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.
4. Do **not** present SEs as if they were extracted from the paper.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatches implied by stars

Because your stars differ (e.g., Age and South lose significance; intolerance has ** instead of ***), the substantive interpretation would change (what “matters” in the model).  

**Fix:** Once (a) sample sizes match, (b) constructs match, (c) standardized coefficients are computed correctly, your significance patterns should align closely with the paper.

---

## What to do to make the generated analysis match the true results (practical checklist)

1. **Confirm dataset and filters**: GSS 1993 only; same population restrictions as the paper.
2. **Rebuild each model’s analytic sample separately** using **listwise deletion on that model’s variables only** (to match the paper’s n per model).
3. **Reconstruct key composites exactly**:
   - Political intolerance scale (items, coding, missing handling).
   - Income per capita (definition, scaling, any transformations).
4. **Recode demographic dummies to match reference groups**:
   - Race/ethnicity: ensure Hispanic and race are handled exactly like the paper.
   - South: correct region coding.
   - Religion tradition: correct classification.
5. **Report the same estimands**:
   - Table should show **standardized β** for predictors, **unstandardized constant**, plus R²/adj R²/n.
   - Use conventional two-tailed p-values and the paper’s star cutoffs.

If you share the exact code (or at least the source variable names you used for `pol_intol`, `inc_pc`, race, and religion), I can pinpoint which coding step is producing each of the sign reversals and the n collapse.
