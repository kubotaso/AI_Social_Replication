### 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches (and how to fix)

Your generated output uses internal dataset names, while the “true” table uses publication labels. That’s fine **only if you clearly map them**—but right now the table1-style output omits variable names entirely (just a column of numbers), making it impossible to verify which coefficient belongs to which variable.

**Mismatches / issues**
- Generated uses: `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`
- True table uses: Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, etc.
- The printed “table1_style” is missing the term labels next to coefficients and SEs (it’s just rows of numbers with dashes).

**Fix**
- Add an explicit name mapping and print variable labels in the regression table.
  - Example mapping:  
    - `educ` → Education  
    - `income_pc` → Household income per capita  
    - `prestg80` → Occupational prestige  
- Ensure the formatted table includes a “Variable” column (or row labels) so row order cannot be misread.

Below are **all coefficient mismatches** between generated and true results (true − generated shown conceptually; I list both values).

#### Model 1 (SES)
- **Education**: generated **-0.310*** vs true **-0.322*** (mismatch)
- **Income per capita**: generated **-0.038** vs true **-0.037** (very close; minor mismatch/rounding)

  *Coefficient matches; significance does not (see significance section).*
- **Age**: generated **0.083** vs true **0.140*** (large mismatch)

### 3) Standard errors: your generated SEs cannot match the “true” table

**Mismatch**
- Your generated table prints SEs for every coefficient.
- The true results explicitly state: **Table 1 does not print standard errors**.

**Fix options**
1) If you are trying to reproduce Table 1 exactly: **remove SEs from the printed table** and report only standardized betas with stars.
2) If you want SEs anyway: compute them, but then you are no longer matching the printed Table 1; you must compare to another source (appendix, replication materials) that reports SEs.

---

### 4) Significance-star mismatches (p-values vs printed stars)

There are multiple cases where your p-values/stars don’t match the printed significance:

- **Model 2 Female**: generated p≈0.058 (no *) but true has *.
- **Model 2 Age**: generated p≈0.066 (no stars) but true is ***.
- **Model 3 Education**: generated * but true **.
- **Model 3 Political intolerance**: generated * but true ***.
- **Model 2 Southern**: generated no stars but true **.
- Others indirectly implied by coefficient gaps.

**Likely causes (given your diagnostics)**
- Your **analytic sample is drastically smaller** than the true table (see N mismatches). Smaller N inflates SEs and reduces significance.
- You may not be using the same estimation choices as the authors (e.g., weights, design corrections, or sample restrictions).

**Fix**
- First fix the sample definition (next section). Then:
  - Use the **same weighting/design** as the study (if the original used survey weights or cluster-robust SEs).
  - Use the same **two-tailed tests and df assumptions**.
  - Only then compute p-values/stars.

---

### 5) The dominant problem: your samples (N) do not match the true models

True N vs Generated N:
- Model 1: **787** vs **748**
- Model 2: **756** vs **477**
- Model 3: **503** vs **269**

Your own missingness tables show why Model 2 and 3 collapse:
- `hispanic` has **298 missing** (massive), shrinking Model 2 from 893 to 477.
- `political_intolerance` has **402 missing**, shrinking Model 3 further to 269.

But the true table retains **756** and **503**, meaning the authors **did not lose that many cases**. That implies at least one of the following is wrong in your pipeline:

**(a) You coded “Hispanic” incorrectly (missingness shouldn’t be 298).**  
Common error: treating “non-Hispanic” codes (e.g., 2 = not Hispanic) as missing instead of 0.

**Fix**
- Recode the Hispanic dummy correctly from the original source variable:
  - If original is something like `hispanic` with values {1=yes, 2=no, 9=DK, 0=NA}, then:
    - set `1 → 1`, `2 → 0`
    - set DK/NA codes to missing
- After recode, missingness on Hispanic should be small, and Model 2 N should jump toward 756.

**(b) You coded political intolerance incorrectly or used the wrong source items/year.**  
You show `political_intolerance_nonmissing = 491` among music-complete, but the true Model 3 uses **503 cases**—close enough that a small coding/sample restriction difference could explain it, but your final Model 3 listwise is only 269 because Hispanic is wiping out cases too.

**Fix**
- Fix Hispanic first (it likely restores most of Model 3 N as well).
- Verify political intolerance scale construction matches the paper:
  - same items
  - same coding direction
  - same handling of “don’t know/refused”
  - same scaling/standardization

**(c) You’re restricting to the wrong subpopulation or year filter.**
You report `N_year_1993 = 1606` and `N_complete_music_18 = 893`. The authors’ Model 1 N=787 suggests they start from a base similar to yours but apply different restrictions (or different “complete music” definition).

**Fix**
- Match the paper’s inclusion rules exactly (age range, valid DV range, year(s), etc.).
- Ensure the DV construction (“number of genres disliked”) uses the same set of genres and the same missing-data rule (e.g., “must answer at least k genres” vs “complete on all genres”).

### 6) Why constants and R² don’t match (even though betas are “standardized”)

Even with standardized coefficients, your **constants and R²** can differ if:
- you standardized variables differently than the authors (z-scoring within your reduced sample, vs within the full analysis sample)
- your DV or predictors are not identical (different items/coding)
- you’re using a different sample (you are)
- you’re using weights (or not) differently than the authors

**Fix**
- After repairing coding + sample, standardize exactly as the authors did:
  - If Table 1 reports *standardized coefficients* from an OLS on raw variables, that usually means betas computed from the unstandardized regression using sample SDs (many packages do this).
  - Make sure you compute betas the same way (and in the same sample, with the same weights if any).

---

### 7) Interpretation mismatches to correct

Even without your narrative text, the generated results would force incorrect substantive claims relative to the true table, because some coefficients differ a lot:

- Generated Model 2 implies **Black (0.121)** is fairly strong; true table says **Black (0.029)** (near zero).
- Generated Model 2 implies **Age is weak (0.083, n.s.)**; true says **Age is strong (0.140***)**.
- Generated Model 3 implies **income is moderately negative (-0.058)**; true says **almost zero (-0.009)**.
- Generated underestimates **Southern** effects in Models 2–3 relative to true.

**Fix**
- Do not “fix” interpretation text directly. Fix the **data coding + sample + standardization** so coefficients align; then interpretations will follow.

---

## What to change, in order (minimal path to match the true Table 1)

1) **Repair Hispanic coding** (stop treating “not Hispanic” as missing). Recompute Model 2/3 Ns.  
2) Recreate the **exact sample restrictions** used in the paper (same year(s), same DV completeness rule).  
3) Verify **political intolerance** scale coding matches the paper.  
4) Re-run OLS with the **same weighting/design choices** as the authors (if any).  
5) Compute **standardized betas** the same way as the paper.  
6) Print Table 1 to match the PDF: **standardized betas + stars, no SEs** (or clearly separate your SE table from the replication of Table 1).

If you paste the original coding scheme for the Hispanic variable and the political intolerance items (value labels / missing codes), I can tell you exactly how to recode them so your N’s and coefficients line up with the true table.
