Score: 34/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: **n, R², adjusted R² all mismatch**

**Model 1 (SES)**
- **Generated:** n=747, R²=0.088, adj R²=0.085  
- **True:** n=787, R²=0.107, adj R²=0.104  
**Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller and producing weaker fit. Reproduce the paper’s **case selection** exactly:
- Use the same wave (GSS 1993) and the same dependent variable construction.
- Use **listwise deletion on exactly the variables in Model 1 only** (educ, inc_pc, prestige, DV), not additional variables from later models.
- Ensure the DV is the paper’s “Number of music genres disliked” (your missingness table suggests `num_genres_disliked` is available; confirm the same coding/range and that it matches the paper’s scale).

**Model 2 (Demographic)**
- **Generated:** n=507, R²=0.135, adj R²=0.118 (and “otherrace” dropped)  
- **True:** n=756, R²=0.151, adj R²=0.139  
**Fix:** You are losing ~249 cases more than the paper and also dropping a predictor. Likely causes:
- Wrong missing-data handling (e.g., treating “inapplicable/Don’t know/Refused” as missing differently than the paper).
- You may be inadvertently requiring non-missing on variables not in Model 2 (e.g., `pol_intol` which is ~47% missing).
- Race variables appear to have **~35% missing** in your missingness table (`black/hispanic/otherrace`), which is unusually high and suggests they were created incorrectly (see section 3).

**Model 3 (Political intolerance)**
- **Generated:** n=286, R²=0.145, adj R²=0.111 (and “otherrace” dropped)  
- **True:** n=503, R²=0.169, adj R²=0.148  
**Fix:** Same as Model 2 plus:
- `pol_intol` missingness is huge (47%). The paper’s n=503 implies they still retain far more than you do, so your `pol_intol` construction likely creates extra missingness (e.g., coding “0” as missing, or requiring multiple items when the paper uses a simpler index).

### 2) Coefficients / standardized betas: many mismatches (and you mix unstandardized b with standardized β)

The paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (plus unstandardized constants). Your “Table1style” output uses the **beta column** (good), but your underlying models also show **unstandardized b and p-values**, which Table 1 does not report. That’s fine as extra info, but the key is: your βs and stars should match the true table.

#### Model 1 β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | **Mismatch** (too small in magnitude) |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | Close (tiny diff) |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | Small mismatch |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | **Mismatch** |
| R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | **Mismatch** |

**Fix:** Once the sample and coding match (above), these usually fall into place. If not:
- Verify standardization method for β: β should come from **standardizing X and Y** (or using `lm(scale(y) ~ scale(x)...)`) on the *same estimation sample*. Don’t compute betas using full-sample SDs if the regression uses a reduced sample.

#### Model 2 β mismatches (including sign error and missing predictor)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.264*** | -0.246*** | **Mismatch** |
| Income pc | -0.053 | -0.054 | Close |
| Prestige | -0.016 | -0.006 | **Mismatch** |
| Female | -0.090* | -0.083* | Small mismatch |
| Age | 0.104* | 0.140*** | **Big mismatch (size + stars)** |
| Black | 0.043 | 0.029 | Small mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.030 | -0.029 | **Sign mismatch** |
| Other race | (blank/dropped) | 0.005 | **Missing predictor** |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.090 | 0.059 | **Mismatch** |
| No religion | -0.019 | -0.012 | Small mismatch |
| Southern | 0.063 | 0.097** | **Mismatch (size + stars)** |
| Constant | 9.285 | 8.507 | **Mismatch** |
| R² | 0.135 | 0.151 | **Mismatch** |
| n | 507 | 756 | **Mismatch** |

**Fixes:**
1) **Race/ethnicity coding is wrong** (most likely reason for the Hispanic sign flip and “otherrace” being dropped).
   - “Other race dropped (NaN)” indicates perfect collinearity or all-missing/constant in the estimation sample.
   - Your missingness table shows `black/hispanic/otherrace` each missing in 562 cases (35%). In the GSS, race/ethnicity should not be missing for a third of respondents—this strongly suggests your dummy creation mistakenly turns valid categories into NA.
   - Correct approach: start from a single categorical race variable (e.g., `race` with categories White/Black/Other, plus a separate Hispanic indicator if the paper does it that way) and generate **mutually exclusive** indicators with a clear reference group (typically White non-Hispanic).
   - Ensure you are not coding “White” as NA, and not propagating NA from unrelated variables.

2) **Age effect is far too weak and loses significance**: in the true table age is 0.140***, you have 0.104*.
   - This often happens when the sample changes a lot (your n is much smaller) or when age is recoded (e.g., using age category vs continuous).
   - Verify `age_v` is continuous age in years and not top-coded/filtered.

3) **Southern coefficient too small and not significant**: true is 0.097** vs your 0.063.
   - Again likely sample/composition differences; also check south coding (0/1) and reference category.

#### Model 3 β mismatches (stars and several coefficients)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157* | -0.151** | **Star mismatch** (and slight value diff) |
| Income pc | -0.050 | -0.009 | **Large mismatch** |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.022 | **Mismatch** |
| Female | -0.122* | -0.095* | **Mismatch** |
| Age | 0.083 (ns) | 0.110* | **Mismatch + star** |
| Black | 0.107 | 0.049 | **Mismatch** |
| Hispanic | 0.028 | 0.031 | Close |
| Other race | dropped | 0.053 | **Missing predictor** |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.037 | 0.066 | **Mismatch** |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.024 | Match |
| Southern | 0.065 | 0.121** | **Large mismatch** |
| Political intolerance | 0.190** | 0.164*** | **Value + star mismatch** |
| Constant | 7.360 | 6.516 | **Mismatch** |
| R² | 0.145 | 0.169 | **Mismatch** |
| n | 286 | 503 | **Mismatch** |

**Fixes:**
- **Political intolerance construction**: your β is larger but less significant; the paper’s is smaller but ***. With correct n (~503), SE should shrink and stars increase. So the main issue is again **sample loss** and possibly different operationalization.
- **Income β is way off** (-0.050 vs -0.009). That is not a rounding issue; it implies either:
  - income is measured differently (e.g., logged vs raw, household vs per-capita, inflation adjustment), or
  - the standardization SD differs because you standardized using the wrong sample, or
  - you used a different income variable than the paper.
  **Fix:** confirm the exact income-per-capita computation the paper used and replicate it (including how they handle zeros, missing, and household size).

---

### 3) Variable-name / level mismatches and “otherrace” being dropped

**Mismatch: `otherrace` appears as “dropped” and has NaN coefficient in Models 2–3**
- **True:** “Other race” is included with β=0.005 (M2) and β=0.053 (M3).
- **Generated:** Other race is missing/dropped.

**Fix:**
- Ensure the race dummies are created from valid categories and are not collinear. Typical pattern:
  - Include dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race
  - Reference group: White (and possibly non-Hispanic White depending on definition)
- Check that “Hispanic” is not overlapping with “Black/Other” if the paper treats Hispanic as an ethnicity; overlapping dummies can cause collinearity or change interpretation. The paper lists Black, Hispanic, Other race as separate terms—this implies a specific coding scheme; replicate it explicitly.

---

### 4) Significance stars / inference mismatches (interpretation problem)

Your stars are derived from your own p-values, but they don’t match the paper because:
1) **Different n (power)**
2) **Different coefficients (coding/sample)**
3) Possibly different **weighting / design corrections** (GSS often uses weights; the paper may or may not)

Concrete mismatches:
- Model 2 Age: you have `*`; true is `***`.
- Model 2 Southern: you have no stars; true is `**`.
- Model 3 Education: you have `*`; true is `**`.
- Model 3 Political intolerance: you have `**`; true is `***`.

**Fix:** after matching variable coding and sample selection, confirm:
- same test type (two-tailed OLS t-tests),
- same α thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001),
- same use (or non-use) of weights. If the paper used weights and you did not (or vice versa), stars and β can shift.

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by your output

Even if not written in prose, your generated tables imply a few interpretive errors relative to the “true” table:

- **Model 2 Hispanic sign**: Generated positive (+0.030) vs true negative (-0.029).  
  **Interpretation fix:** Once coded correctly, the expected direction is slightly negative (and nonsignificant). Don’t interpret Hispanic as increasing disliked genres based on the current model.

- **Model 3 income effect**: Generated moderately negative (-0.050) vs true near zero (-0.009).  
  **Interpretation fix:** In the paper, income per capita contributes essentially nothing in Model 3; don’t claim a meaningful income effect.

- **Southern effect**: Generated small (0.065 ns) vs true moderate (0.121**) in Model 3.  
  **Interpretation fix:** With correct replication, “Southern” should be a statistically significant positive association in Models 2 and 3 (per the true table).

---

### 6) Why your missingness diagnostics signal the core problem

Your missingness table:
- `black/hispanic/otherrace` each missing 34.99% (562 cases)
- `pol_intol` missing 47.07% (756 cases)

This pattern strongly suggests:
- Race dummies were constructed in a way that sets NA for many respondents (e.g., only coding 1s and leaving 0s as NA rather than 0).
- Political intolerance index may be computed requiring multiple items, turning partial responses into NA more aggressively than the paper.

**Fix (implementation-level):**
- When creating dummies, explicitly set 0/1 and keep 0 as 0, not NA.
  - Example logic: `black = (race=="Black")*1` and then set missing only if race is missing.
- For scales/indexes like political intolerance, replicate the paper’s rule:
  - if paper uses “count of intolerant responses across items,” allow partial completion if they did, or require complete cases only if they did.
  - Don’t inadvertently code “tolerant” responses as missing.

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table (checklist)

1) **Recreate Table 1 betas** by estimating models on the **exact same estimation sample per model**, and compute β using within-sample standardization.
2) **Fix race/ethnicity coding** so Black/Hispanic/Other race are valid and not mostly missing; ensure “Other race” is not dropped.
3) **Fix political intolerance variable construction** to reduce artificial missingness and align with the paper’s measure.
4) **Ensure Model 1 and Model 2 do NOT require non-missing pol_intol** (no accidental global listwise deletion across all variables).
5) **Verify income-per-capita and education coding** matches the paper (transformations, caps, exclusions).
6) **Confirm weighting** (if paper uses none, run unweighted OLS; if it uses GSS weights, apply them consistently).

If you paste your variable construction code (especially for `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, and `pol_intol`) and how you subset cases per model, I can point to the exact lines causing the n-loss and the sign/collinearity problems.
