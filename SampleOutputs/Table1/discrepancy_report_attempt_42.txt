============================================================

## 1) Model existence / sample size / fit statistics mismatches

### A. Models 2 and 3 are missing entirely in the generated output
- **Generated:** Model 2 N = 0, Model 3 N = 0; all coefficients are `NaN`; R²/Adj R² are `NaN`.
- **True:** Model 2 **N = 756**, R² **0.151**, Adj R² **0.139**. Model 3 **N = 503**, R² **0.169**, Adj R² **0.148**.

**Fix**
- The generated pipeline is dropping every row for Models 2 and 3 due to a constructed variable being all-missing (see “hispanic” below). You must **correct the Hispanic variable construction** (or temporarily exclude it) so listwise deletion doesn’t wipe the sample to zero.
- After fixing Hispanic, re-run listwise deletion separately by model to reproduce N≈756 and N≈503.

---

### B. Model 1 N mismatch
- **Generated:** Model 1 N = **758**
- **True:** Model 1 N = **787**

**Fix**
- Your Model 1 is losing 29 extra cases relative to the published table. That typically happens when:
  1) your DV is restricted to a subset (“complete_music_18”) or
  2) you used a stricter missing-data rule than the authors (e.g., dropping on variables not actually used), or
  3) your income/prestige recodes created additional missingness.

Concretely, your diagnostics show:
- DV nonmissing = 893
- educ nonmissing = 846
- income_pc nonmissing = 822
- prestg80 nonmissing = 860  
Listwise intersection gives **758**, which matches your Model 1. The paper’s 787 implies the authors had **less missingness** on SES measures (or used a different imputation/recoding/variable version).

To match the paper:
- Verify you are using the **same year/subsample** as the paper (you have `N_year_1993 = 1606` and DV complete = 893; the paper’s N’s suggest a different inclusion rule than “complete_music_18” alone).
- Verify the exact original variables: “Household income per capita” may be computed differently than your `income_pc` (e.g., different household size variable, top-coding rules, or using a non-per-capita income measure).
- Check `prestg80` coding and missing treatment: don’t convert “inapplicable” or “DK” into missing if the authors kept them via a specific code handling.
- If the paper used **pairwise** or a milder missingness approach: you must instead implement exactly what they did (but Table 1 OLS is usually listwise—so more likely you have the wrong variable versions/filters).

---

### C. R²/Adj R² mismatch for Model 1
- **Generated:** R² = **0.10877**, Adj R² = **0.10522**
- **True:** R² = **0.107**, Adj R² = **0.104**

These are close, but not identical—consistent with the **N mismatch** and/or slightly different variable construction (income_pc, prestige, or standardization).

**Fix**
- Once you match the sample definition and variables (especially income per capita + prestige), R² should align more closely.

---

## 2) Coefficient (and significance) mismatches by variable

Important: the *True Results* are **standardized coefficients**. Your generated `beta_std` appears to be standardized too, but you must ensure you standardized the same way (see Section 4).

### Model 1 (SES) coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated βstd | True βstd | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.332*** | **-0.322*** | magnitude too negative by ~0.010 |
| Household income per capita | **-0.034** (ns) | **-0.037** (ns) | small difference |
| Occupational prestige | **0.029** (ns) | **0.016** (ns) | notably different (sign same, magnitude larger) |

**Fix**
- These differences are consistent with (a) different sample N and/or (b) different construction/standardization of predictors.
- To match:
  - ensure you are using the same SES variable definitions as the authors:
    - income: exactly “household income per capita” (same numerator/denominator, same inflation year, same topcoding)
    - prestige: same prestige scale and coding for missing/inapplicable
  - ensure you standardize the **same variables on the same estimation sample** (see Section 4).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic) and Model 3 (Political intolerance): everything is missing in generated
- **Generated:** all terms are `NaN` and displayed as em-dashes.
- **True:** nonzero coefficients for all listed terms.

**Fix**
- This is entirely driven by your Hispanic variable being all missing (see below). Once corrected, Models 2 and 3 will estimate and populate coefficients.

---

## 3) Variable name / construction mismatches

### A. `hispanic` is not constructed (all missing) in generated output
- **Generated diagnostics:**  
  - `note_hispanic: "Hispanic not constructible from provided mapping; set to NaN"`  
  - `missingness_m2: hispanic nonmissing = 0, missing = 893`  
  - This forces **listwise deletion to N=0** in Models 2 and 3.

- **True:** “Hispanic” is a real covariate with coefficients:
  - Model 2: -0.029
  - Model 3: 0.031

**Fix**
- Build `hispanic` correctly from the dataset’s race/ethnicity fields. Typical fixes:
  1) If there is a direct Hispanic indicator (e.g., `hispanic`, `ethnic`, `latino`): use it.
  2) If ethnicity is separate from race: define `hispanic = 1` if respondent reports Hispanic/Latino regardless of race.
  3) If race categories include Hispanic as a race option: map that category to `hispanic=1` and adjust the race dummies accordingly.

Also ensure mutually exclusive race dummies match the paper’s scheme:
- white is reference
- black, hispanic, other race are indicator variables (and **not** overlapping)

---

### B. Political intolerance variable: sample nonmissing is 491 vs paper N=503
- **Generated:** `political_intolerance nonmissing = 491` (among DV-complete)
- **True Model 3 N:** 503

So you are losing 12 cases beyond what the paper reports, even before other covariates’ missingness.

**Fix**
- Confirm you constructed “political intolerance” using the exact items and rules used by the authors:
  - same items (often a scale from tolerance questions)
  - same range/orientation (higher = more intolerance?)
  - same handling of “don’t know,” refusals, and missing items (e.g., allowing 1 missing item and averaging remaining vs requiring complete items)
- Confirm you’re using the same survey wave/subset for those items.

---

### C. Constant terms don’t match
- **Generated Model 1 constant:** 11.086  
- **True Model 1 constant:** 10.920  
(and Model 2 and 3 constants missing due to N=0)

**Fix**
- Constant differences stem from different:
  - estimation sample (your N differs),
  - DV construction (maybe your DV differs slightly),
  - or inclusion/exclusion filters.

Additionally, because the table reports **standardized coefficients**, authors sometimes still report the **raw intercept** from an unstandardized DV model (as appears here). Make sure your intercept is coming from the same specification (unstandardized DV; predictors may be standardized only for reporting).

---

## 4) Standard errors: generated output conflicts with the “true” table format

### A. Generated table implies standard errors exist (but they are not shown clearly)
- Your “Generated Results” show a second numeric row under the first coefficient (`-0.034` then `0.029`, etc.), but it’s not labeled as SEs and doesn’t match typical formatting.
- **True:** the PDF table **does not print standard errors at all** (only standardized betas and stars).

**Fix**
- To match the published table:
  - Remove standard errors from the output entirely (or don’t attempt to compare SEs).
  - Keep only standardized coefficients + significance stars.
- If you *must* compute SEs for your own output, don’t compare them to Table 1 because they are not provided there.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches / model labeling issues

### A. “Standardized OLS coefficients” vs what you computed
- **True:** standardized coefficients (betas) are printed.
- **Generated:** column `beta_std` suggests standardized, but you must ensure the standardization matches the paper:
  - Are you standardizing X only, or both X and Y?
  - Are you standardizing using the full DV-complete sample, or each model’s listwise sample?

**Fix**
- To replicate standardized betas as typically reported:
  - Fit OLS on raw variables, then compute standardized beta as  
    \(\beta_{std} = b \cdot \frac{SD(X)}{SD(Y)}\)  
    using **the model’s estimation sample**.
  - Alternatively, z-score X and Y within the estimation sample and regress z(Y) on z(X); the slopes should match.
- Ensure the significance stars come from the *unstandardized* regression t-tests (equivalent under linear rescaling, but must use the same sample).

## 6) Checklist of concrete changes needed so the generated analysis matches the true table

1) **Fix `hispanic` coding** so it is not all missing; re-run Models 2 and 3.
2) **Reconstruct political_intolerance** using the authors’ exact items and missing-data rule to raise nonmissing from 491 toward the paper’s implied availability (and yield Model 3 N=503 after listwise deletion with other covariates).
3) **Align the analytic sample** with the paper:
   - confirm year/wave and inclusion rules
   - ensure DV “number of music genres disliked” is computed identically
4) **Align SES variables**:
   - `income_pc` definition (per capita, scaling, topcoding, inflation)
   - `prestg80` coding and missing rules
   - education coding (years vs degree categories converted to years)
5) **Report format**:
   - output standardized coefficients only (no SEs)
   - include constants and R²/Adj R² and N matching the table.

If you share the codebook snippet (or the raw variable names for race/ethnicity and the intolerance items), I can tell you exactly how to map them so Models 2 and 3 reproduce the published N’s and coefficients.
