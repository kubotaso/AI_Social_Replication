============================================================

Below is a variable-by-variable and model-by-model comparison of your **Generated Results** vs the **True (paper/Table 1) Results**, flagging **every mismatch** in (a) variable inclusion/names, (b) coefficients (standardized β and constants), (c) implied standard errors/significance, and (d) interpretation. I also explain **how to fix each issue so the generated analysis matches Table 1**.

---

## 0) First, a structural mismatch: what Table 1 reports vs what you generated

### What the paper’s Table 1 is
- Table 1 reports **standardized OLS coefficients (β)** for predictors.
- Table 1 reports **unstandardized constants**.
- Table 1 **does not report standard errors or p-values**, only stars.

### What your generated output mixes together
- You show both **b (unstandardized)** and **beta (standardized)** plus **p-values** and **SE implied by p-values**.
- Your “Table1style” output appears to print **standardized β**, which is correct in principle—but many β values don’t match the paper.

**Fix**
1. Decide: “match the paper” means: **report β only (plus stars), and constant unstandardized**, and match sample sizes/case handling used in the paper.
2. If you keep p-values for internal checking, don’t treat Table 1 as if it contained SEs—because it doesn’t. The match criterion should be on **β and stars**, plus **R²/Adj R²/N**.

## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (N, R², Adj R², dropped variables)

### Model 1 (SES)
**Generated fit_stats**
- n = **747**
- R² = **0.088**
- Adj R² = **0.085**

**True**
- n = **787**
- R² = **0.107**
- Adj R² = **0.104**

**Mismatch**
- N is short by **40 cases**.
- R² and Adj R² are too low.

**Likely cause**
- Different missing-data handling than the paper (e.g., listwise deletion across a larger set than needed, different recodes, or excluding “don’t know/refused” differently).
- Possibly using a different dependent variable coding for “num_genres_disliked”.

**Fix**
- Reproduce the paper’s **exact sample restrictions and missing-value recodes** *per model*.
- For Model 1, listwise delete **only** on: outcome + education + income + prestige (not on demographics/political intolerance).
- Ensure GSS missing codes (often 8/9/98/99 etc.) are recoded to NA **exactly as in the paper**.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
**Generated**
- n = **745**
- R² = **0.125**
- Adj R² = **0.111**

**True**
- n = **756**
- R² = **0.151**
- Adj R² = **0.139**

**Mismatch**
- N short by **11**
- R²/Adj R² too low.

**Fix**
- Same as above: listwise delete only on variables in Model 2 (not Model 3).
- Verify that the dummy variables (race/religion/region) are coded the same way as the paper (reference categories matter for constants and sometimes for how “Other race” is defined).

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
**Generated**
- n = **421**
- R² = **0.132**
- Adj R² = **0.108**
- “dropped: hispanic” and Hispanic coefficient is **NaN**

**True**
- n = **503**
- R² = **0.169**
- Adj R² = **0.148**
- Hispanic is included with β = **0.031** (not dropped)

**Mismatch**
- N short by **82** (very large).
- R² too low.
- **Hispanic was incorrectly dropped** and shows as missing/NaN.
- This is a major estimation/specification failure relative to the paper.

**Likely causes (most to least likely)**
1. **Perfect collinearity / singularity** induced by your dummy coding (e.g., including both `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` *and* a full set of race dummies without a reference; or coding errors where “hispanic” duplicates another column).
2. Subsetting/merging error where `hispanic` becomes all 0/1 with no variation in the Model 3 estimation sample.
3. Incorrect NA handling causing `hispanic` to be all NA after listwise deletion in Model 3.
4. Using a different “hispanic” definition than the paper (e.g., ethnicity vs race).

**Fix**
- Rebuild race/ethnicity coding to match the paper:
  - Use **one reference category** (typically “White non-Hispanic” or “White” depending on paper).
  - Include exactly the three indicators shown (Black, Hispanic, Other race) with White as omitted.
- After filtering to Model 3 estimation sample, check:
  - `table(hispanic, useNA="ifany")` and variance.
  - `alias(lm(...))` in R to detect collinearity.
- Confirm political intolerance recode is correct (see Section 4), because your missingness suggests enormous attrition.

## 2) Model 1 coefficient mismatches (Table 1 standardized β + constant)

### Education
- **Generated β:** -0.292***  
- **True β:** -0.322***  
**Mismatch:** magnitude too small (less negative).

### Income per capita
- **Generated β:** -0.039  
- **True β:** -0.037  
**Mismatch:** minor (close).

### Occupational prestige
- **Generated β:** 0.020  
- **True β:** 0.016  
**Mismatch:** small.

### Constant
- **Generated constant:** 10.638  
- **True constant:** 10.920  
**Mismatch:** too low.

**Fix**
- Once N and coding match, the β and constant should move toward the paper.
- Ensure **standardization method** matches:
  - Paper’s β are typically from standardizing variables (or using software’s standardized coefficients).
  - If you compute β manually, standardize using **sample SDs in the estimation sample** (after listwise deletion), not full-sample SDs.

## 3) Model 2 coefficient mismatches (standardized β + constant + stars)

I compare against the paper’s β.

### Education
- Generated β = **-0.229*** vs True **-0.246*** → mismatch (too small)

### Income
- Generated β = **-0.055** vs True **-0.054** → close

### Occupational prestige
- Generated β = **0.002** vs True **-0.006** → **sign mismatch**

### Female
- Generated β = **-0.086***? (your table shows -0.086* with p=.014) vs True **-0.083***? (paper: -0.083*)  
→ β close; star consistent (*).

### Age
- Generated β = **0.125*** vs True **0.140*** → mismatch (too small)

### Black
- Generated β = **0.022** vs True **0.029** → mismatch (small)

### Hispanic
- Generated β = **-0.026** vs True **-0.029** → mismatch (small)

### Other race
- Generated β = **-0.010** vs True **0.005** → **sign mismatch**

### Conservative Protestant
- Generated β = **0.092***? (you show 0.092* with p=.015) vs True **0.059 (no star)**  
→ **mismatch in magnitude and significance** (you find significant; paper does not).

### No religion
- Generated β = **-0.002** vs True **-0.012** → mismatch

### Southern
- Generated β = **0.062** (p=.084, no star) vs True **0.097** **(two stars)**  
→ **mismatch in magnitude and significance**.

### Constant
- Generated = **8.490** vs True **8.507** → close.

### Fit
- Generated R² 0.125 vs True 0.151 → mismatch (underfitting / different sample/coding)

**Fixes (most important)**
1. **Race and region coding/reference categories**: Your sign flips on “Other race” and prestige suggests coding or sample differences.
2. **Weights/design**: If the paper used GSS weights (common), unweighted OLS will shift β and p/stars. Table 1 often reflects weighted results even if not explicit.
3. **Exact year/sample**: Ensure you are using **GSS 1993 only** and the same universe restrictions.

---

## 4) Model 3 coefficient mismatches (and the “Hispanic dropped” error)

### Education
- Generated β = **-0.145***? (you show -0.145* with p=.013) vs True **-0.151** (**)  
→ β close-ish, but **significance mismatch** (* vs **).

### Income
- Generated β = **-0.015** vs True **-0.009** → mismatch

### Prestige
- Generated β = **-0.010** vs True **-0.022** → mismatch

### Female
- Generated β = **-0.100***? (p=.034, *) vs True **-0.095* ** → close, stars consistent.

### Age
- Generated β = **0.057** (p=.243, ns) vs True **0.110* ** → **large mismatch** in magnitude and significance.

### Black
- Generated β = **0.056** (ns) vs True **0.049** (ns) → close

### Hispanic
- Generated: **dropped/NaN** vs True **0.031** → **critical mismatch**

### Other race
- Generated β = **0.049** vs True **0.053** → close

### Conservative Protestant
- Generated β = **0.084** (p=.095, ns) vs True **0.066** (ns) → mismatch small

### No religion
- Generated β = **0.026** vs True **0.024** → close

### Southern
- Generated β = **0.064** (ns) vs True **0.121** ** → **big mismatch** (magnitude + significance)

### Political intolerance
- Generated β = **0.178*** vs True **0.164*** → mismatch (somewhat higher)

### Constant
- Generated = **7.077** vs True **6.516** → mismatch

### Fit
- Generated R² 0.132 vs True 0.169; N 421 vs 503 → mismatch

**Fix**
- **Primary:** fix Hispanic being dropped (dummy trap / collinearity / recode).
- **Secondary:** fix the N loss driven by political intolerance missingness:
  - Your missingness table shows `pol_intol` missing **47%**—that will kill N.
  - Paper’s Model 3 N=503 suggests *less* attrition than your pipeline produces.
  - You may have constructed `pol_intol` incorrectly (e.g., summing items but treating valid skips as missing, or not using the paper’s imputation/scale construction rules).

Concrete checks to align with the paper:
1. Recreate political intolerance scale exactly as the paper:
   - correct items,
   - correct direction,
   - correct range 0–15,
   - correct handling of DK/NA/skip.
2. Confirm the dependent variable “number of genres disliked” is coded identically (range, exclusions).
3. Use the same estimation sample definition as the paper (GSS 1993, same respondent filters).

---

## 5) Variable name / label mismatches

### Inconsistencies
- Generated uses labels like **“Occupational prestige”** but missingness uses `prestg80_v`. That’s fine if it’s a label, but you must ensure it’s the **same prestige measure** the paper used.
- Generated includes **“Political intolerance (0–15)”**—good label, but given huge missingness, it likely does *not* match the paper’s constructed variable.

### “Dropped: hispanic”
- Your fit_stats explicitly says Model 3 dropped hispanic; paper includes it.
- That is both a **variable inclusion mismatch** and an **estimation problem**.

**Fix**
- Ensure one-to-one mapping of paper variables to your dataset variables, documented in code.
- Add automated assertions before modeling:
  - all predictors have variance,
  - no perfect collinearity,
  - expected N matches within a tolerance.

---

## 6) Interpretation / reporting mismatches (stars and what they imply)

Because Table 1 stars are based on the paper’s model, your stars should match if (and only if) you match:
- the exact sample,
- coding,
- weights,
- and model specification.

Clear star mismatches:
- Model 2: **Southern** (paper **, you ns)
- Model 2: **Conservative Protestant** (paper ns, you *)
- Model 3: **Age** (paper *, you ns)
- Model 3: **Education** (paper **, you *)

**Fix**
- Don’t “force” stars to match by changing thresholds; instead fix the underlying model replication (sample/coding/weights).
- If the paper used **two-tailed tests**, keep two-tailed. (Your p-values seem two-tailed, but replication is off.)

---

## 7) Minimal actionable checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Use GSS 1993 only** and the same universe restrictions as the paper.
2. **Recode missing values correctly** for every component variable (GSS special codes to NA).
3. **Construct the dependent variable** (`num_genres_disliked`) exactly as the paper.
4. **Construct political intolerance (0–15)** exactly as the paper; reduce missingness to be consistent with Model 3 N≈503.
5. **Dummy coding**
   - Race: Black, Hispanic, Other race with White omitted (and ensure Hispanic is not collinear with race coding).
   - Religion: Conservative Protestant and No religion with an appropriate omitted category.
   - Region: Southern with non-South omitted.
6. **Run OLS with the same weighting strategy** as the paper (if weights were used).
7. **Compute standardized coefficients β** from the final estimation sample (post-listwise deletion) in the same way the paper/software does.
8. Confirm your output matches on:
   - N, R², Adj R²,
   - β coefficients (sign and magnitude),
   - constants,
   - significance stars.

If you share the code (or at least the exact variable construction steps for `num_genres_disliked` and `pol_intol`, plus your dummy coding), I can point to the exact line(s) causing (a) the N drop and (b) the “Hispanic dropped” singularity.
