## A. Fit statistics / sample sizes (fit_stats, model_samples): mismatches

### Model 1
- **n mismatch:** Generated **747** vs True **787**.
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.088** vs True **0.107**.
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.0846** vs True **0.104**.
- **DV mean/sd:** Generated reports DV mean/sd; the paper table does not, so this isn’t “wrong,” but it signals you’re not reproducing the exact estimation sample used for Table 1.

**How to fix**
- Recreate the paper’s **exact analytic sample** for each model (same inclusion rules, same missing-data handling, same coding of DV/IVs).
- The paper’s Table 1 uses **GSS 1993**; ensure you filter to the same year/wave and any other restrictions used in the paper.
- Do **listwise deletion per model** on exactly the variables included in that model, matching the paper’s approach.

### Model 2
- **n mismatch:** Generated **507** vs True **756**.
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.135** vs True **0.151**.
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.118** vs True **0.139**.
- **Dropped predictor:** Generated says **otherrace** dropped; True includes **Other race (β=0.005)**.

**How to fix**
- Your race variables show extreme missingness (see section D). You likely coded race dummies in a way that creates missing for most cases (e.g., using a variable that is missing for many respondents, or treating nonresponse/“not asked” as NA instead of 0).
- Ensure **Other race** is included as a proper dummy with a clear reference category (typically White omitted), and that it has nonmissing values for the analytic sample.

### Model 3
- **n mismatch:** Generated **286** vs True **503**.
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.145** vs True **0.169**.
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.111** vs True **0.148**.
- **Dropped predictor:** Generated drops **otherrace** again; True includes it (**β=0.053**).

**How to fix**
- Your **political intolerance** variable has ~47% missing; the paper’s Model 3 still has **503** cases, so your construction likely introduces *extra* missingness beyond what the paper had (e.g., requiring all items when the paper used a scale with partial completion, different coding, or different item set).
- Rebuild the political intolerance scale exactly as the paper defines it (items, range, and missing-data rule).

## B. Coefficients: standardized (β) and constants

Important: **True Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)** and **unstandardized constants**. Your generated tables mix:
- **b (unstandardized)** and **beta (standardized)**, and then your `table1_panel` displays **beta** (good), but the values don’t match the paper.

Below are the key mismatches (Generated β vs True β, unless noted).

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Constant (unstd):** Generated **10.638** vs True **10.920**.
- **Education β:** Generated **-0.292*** vs True **-0.322*** (too small in magnitude).
- **Income β:** Generated **-0.039** vs True **-0.037** (close).
- **Prestige β:** Generated **0.020** vs True **0.016** (close).

**How to fix**
- Once the sample matches (n=787) and variable coding matches, education’s β and the constant should move toward the published values.
- Verify education is measured identically (e.g., years of schooling vs degree categories converted to years).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Constant (unstd):** Generated **9.285** vs True **8.507** (substantial mismatch).
- **Education β:** Generated **-0.264*** vs True **-0.246***.
- **Income β:** Generated **-0.053** vs True **-0.054** (close).
- **Prestige β:** Generated **-0.016** vs True **-0.006** (more negative than true).
- **Female β:** Generated **-0.090***? (your panel shows -0.090*; your full table shows p=.034, so *) vs True **-0.083*** (close).
- **Age β:** Generated **0.104***? (panel shows 0.104*) vs True **0.140*** (too small).
- **Black β:** Generated **0.043** vs True **0.029** (close-ish, but your p-value is nonsensical—see section C).
- **Hispanic β:** Generated **0.030** vs True **-0.029** (**sign mismatch**).
- **Other race:** Generated **missing/dropped** vs True **0.005**.
- **Conservative Protestant β:** Generated **0.090** (p=.053) vs True **0.059**.
- **No religion β:** Generated **-0.019** vs True **-0.012** (close).
- **Southern β:** Generated **0.063** vs True **0.097**** (too small, and significance differs).

**How to fix**
- Biggest red flags are **Hispanic sign**, **Other race dropped**, **Age too small**, **Southern too small**. These are classic symptoms of:
  1) wrong coding of race/ethnicity indicators (reference group, missing values treated incorrectly, or overlapping categories),
  2) wrong sample,
  3) different standardization approach (must standardize on the estimation sample).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Constant (unstd):** Generated **7.360** vs True **6.516**.
- **Education β:** Generated **-0.157***? (panel shows -0.157*) vs True **-0.151**** (very close; but your star differs).
- **Income β:** Generated **-0.050** vs True **-0.009** (**large mismatch**).
- **Prestige β:** Generated **-0.011** vs True **-0.022**.
- **Female β:** Generated **-0.122***? vs True **-0.095*** (more negative).
- **Age β:** Generated **0.083 (ns)** vs True **0.110*** (**interpretation/significance mismatch**).
- **Black β:** Generated **0.107** vs True **0.049**.
- **Hispanic β:** Generated **0.028** vs True **0.031** (close).
- **Other race:** Generated dropped vs True **0.053**.
- **Conservative Protestant β:** Generated **0.037** vs True **0.066**.
- **No religion β:** Generated **0.024** vs True **0.024** (matches).
- **Southern β:** Generated **0.065** vs True **0.121**** (too small).
- **Political intolerance β:** Generated **0.190** (p=.00265, ** ) vs True **0.164*** (**size and significance mismatch**).

**How to fix**
- Income β being wildly different (−0.050 vs −0.009) suggests your **inc_pc** construction differs (equivalization, inflation adjustment, top-coding, logged vs unlogged, or scaling).
- Political intolerance β/significance and n strongly suggest your **pol_intol** scale is not the same as the paper’s and/or you’re losing too many cases via missing-data rules.

---

## C. Standard errors and p-values: interpretation mismatch with the “true” table

- **True Table 1 does not report standard errors** at all.
- Your generated output reports **p-values and stars based on SEs**, then compares them to a table that uses stars but may come from:
  - different df/sample,
  - possibly slightly different model spec/coding,
  - and in any case not intended to be reproduced via your SEs unless everything else matches perfectly.

Also, some of your generated p-values are internally inconsistent with the coefficient magnitudes:
- Example: **Model 2 “Black”** has **b=0.5446** but **p=0.87** (that combination is unlikely unless SE is enormous, which hints at sparse/miscoded categories or near-collinearity due to race coding/missingness).

**How to fix**
- Don’t treat “SE mismatch” as an error relative to Table 1, because **SEs are not available** in the “true results.”
- If your goal is to match Table 1, focus on matching **β, constants, n, R²**, and then derive stars from your own p-values only after the sample/spec match.
- After fixing coding/sample, re-check whether your computed stars align with the paper’s stars.

## D. Variable-name/coding problems (the biggest source of divergence)

### 1) Race variables: massive missingness and dropped “otherrace”
Your missingness table shows:
- **black/hispanic/otherrace each missing ~35%**.

In typical GSS race variables, you shouldn’t see that much missing if coded correctly. This likely means:
- you created race dummies from a variable that is only asked of a subset, or
- you treated “inapplicable”/“don’t know”/not asked as NA incorrectly,
- or you required multiple race/ethnicity fields simultaneously and created NA if any component missing.

**Fix**
- Reconstruct race/ethnicity dummies from the same base variables the paper used.
- Ensure mutually exclusive categories with **White as reference** and dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race.
- Code non-membership as **0**, not NA.
- Only set NA when race/ethnicity truly missing, and mirror the paper’s treatment of “DK/Refused.”

### 2) “Other race” appears as “NaN” and dropped
Generated models show `Other race` as NaN and `dropped_predictors = otherrace`.

**Fix**
- This happens when the predictor is **all missing** in the estimation sample, or **has zero variance** (all 0/1).
- After fixing race coding, confirm `otherrace` has variation within each model’s estimation sample.

### 3) Political intolerance scale construction
Generated shows **pol_intol missing 47%** and Model 3 n=286, but the paper has n=503.

**Fix**
- Replicate the paper’s scale exactly:
  - same items,
  - same scoring to reach **0–15**,
  - same rule for partial missingness (e.g., allow up to k missing items and prorate or sum available).
- Ensure reverse-coding is correct if any items are reversed.
- Confirm the range is truly 0–15 after coding (no unintended NA inflation).

### 4) Income per capita (inc_pc) scaling differences
Model 3 income β is drastically off relative to the paper.

**Fix**
- Verify:
  - whether income is individual/household,
  - whether it is already per-capita in the source (you may be dividing twice),
  - whether the paper uses a particular transformation (e.g., log, z-score before standardization, trimming).
- Standardize β using the same sample and the same untransformed/transformed version.

---

## E. Interpretation mismatches (signs/stars)

### Hispanic sign (Model 2)
- Generated β **+0.030**, True β **−0.029**.

**Fix**
- This is almost certainly coding/reference-category error (e.g., Hispanic coded as White, or overlap with “Other race,” or using ethnicity variable incorrectly).
- Ensure Hispanic is coded per the paper’s definition and that categories are mutually exclusive.

### Southern effect size/significance
- Generated β ~0.063–0.065 vs True β **0.097** (Model 2) and **0.121** (Model 3), and true has **significance stars** (** in both).

**Fix**
- After sample alignment, re-check that “Southern” matches the paper’s operationalization (Census South? birth region vs current region?).

### Political intolerance coefficient and stars
- Generated β **0.190** with **p=.00265 (**)** vs True β **0.164***.

**Fix**
- Once the scale and n match, the coefficient and its significance should align more closely.
- Also ensure you are using **two-tailed** tests (paper says two-tailed).

## F. Concrete steps to make generated analysis match Table 1

1) **Restrict to the exact dataset/survey year** used (GSS 1993) and any sample restrictions in the paper.
2) **Recreate DV** `num_genres_disliked` exactly as the paper defines it (same items/handling of “don’t know”).
3) **Recode predictors** to match the paper:
   - `educ_yrs` exactly in years,
   - `inc_pc` exactly as “household income per capita” (confirm denominator and currency/top-codes),
   - `prestg80_v` consistent prestige score variable,
   - demographics: female, age, race/ethnicity, religion, south.
4) **Fix race/ethnicity dummies** so they are nonmissing for almost all cases, mutually exclusive, and include “Other race” with variation.
5) **Fix political intolerance (0–15)** to match item composition and missingness rules; target **n≈503** in Model 3.
6) **Compute standardized coefficients β** the same way the paper reports them:
   - fit OLS on the same analytic sample,
   - standardize using **within-sample SDs** (or fit on z-scored variables while leaving the constant unstandardized if you’re reproducing their presentation).
7) **Re-run models and compare**: n, R², adj R², βs, constant. Only after that, check stars.

If you paste your variable coding rules (especially race, income per capita, and political intolerance construction), I can pinpoint exactly which recodes are producing the huge missingness and the Hispanic/Other race problems.
