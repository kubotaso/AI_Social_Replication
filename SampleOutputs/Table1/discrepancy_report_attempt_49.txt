## 1) Fit statistics (R², adjusted R², N, dropped variable)

### Mismatches
- **Model 1 (SES)**
  - Generated: **n=747**, **R²=0.0883**, **Adj R²=0.0846**
  - True: **n=787**, **R²=0.107**, **Adj R²=0.104**
  - **Mismatch:** all three stats (N, R², adj R²) are off.

- **Model 2 (Demographic)**
  - Generated: **n=507**, **R²=0.1353**, **Adj R²=0.1179**, **dropped=otherrace**
  - True: **n=756**, **R²=0.151**, **Adj R²=0.139**, and **Other race is included (β=0.005)**
  - **Mismatch:** N, R², adj R², and “otherrace dropped” is wrong.

- **Model 3 (Political intolerance)**
  - Generated: **n=286**, **R²=0.1455**, **Adj R²=0.1112**, **dropped=otherrace**
  - True: **n=503**, **R²=0.169**, **Adj R²=0.148**, and **Other race is included (β=0.053)**
  - **Mismatch:** N, R², adj R², and “otherrace dropped” is wrong.

### How to fix
- **Stop listwise-deleting on miscoded race variables.** Your “otherrace” is constant 0 (see missingness/ranges: min=0, max=0, mean=0), which strongly suggests it was **constructed incorrectly** and/or **race missingness was mishandled**, causing big N losses and dropping.
- Recreate race dummies so that:
  - they are **mutually exclusive and exhaustive** (or use a single categorical race factor with a reference group),
  - “Other race” actually has 1s for respondents not White/Black/Hispanic (depending on the paper’s coding).
- Ensure you are using the **same sample restrictions as the paper** (GSS 1993 + valid DV + valid covariates), because your Ns (747/507/286) are far below the true Ns (787/756/503), especially Models 2–3.

## 2) Variable names and coding problems

### Mismatches / red flags
- **Race variables are inconsistent / impossible**
  - Generated missingness table:
    - `black` mean ≈ 0.099 (plausible)
    - `hispanic` mean ≈ **0.900** (not plausible for GSS 1993; also conflicts with “Black” prevalence)
    - `otherrace` is **all zeros** (min=0, max=0)
  - Yet models include “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race”.
  - **Interpretation:** your `hispanic` dummy is likely inverted or misdefined (e.g., “not Hispanic”), and `otherrace` was never set to 1 for anyone.

### How to fix
- Rebuild race/ethnicity indicators from the original GSS variables with correct logic. For example (conceptually):
  - `black = (race == "Black")`
  - `hispanic = (hispanic_origin == "Yes")` **or** if the paper uses race categories including Hispanic, follow that exactly
  - `otherrace = (race in c("Other", "Asian", "Native American", ...))` or “not White/Black/Hispanic” depending on the paper
- Verify with frequency tables that each dummy has a plausible share and that **otherrace has non-zero cases**.

## 3) Coefficients (standardized β) and constants

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** and **unstandardized constants**. Your “table1style” output appears to be standardized βs (good), but many don’t match.

### Model 1 (SES): β and constant
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | **-0.322*** | **Mismatch** |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | Slight mismatch |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | Slight mismatch |
| Constant | 10.638 | **10.920** | **Mismatch** |

**Fix:** once the sample and coding match the paper (N=787 and same variable construction), the standardized β and constant should move toward the published values. The constant mismatch is also consistent with using a different estimation sample.

### Model 2 (Demographic): β and constant
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.264*** | **-0.246*** | **Mismatch** |
| Income pc | -0.053 | -0.054 | Close |
| Prestige | -0.016 | **-0.006** | **Mismatch** |
| Female | -0.090* | **-0.083***? (true shows -0.083*) | Mismatch (magnitude) |
| Age | 0.104* | **0.140*** | **Mismatch** |
| Black | 0.043 | 0.029 | Mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.030 | **-0.029** | **Sign mismatch** |
| Other race | (blank/NA) | **0.005** | **Missing entirely** |
| Cons Prot | 0.090 | **0.059** | Mismatch |
| No religion | -0.019 | -0.012 | Mismatch |
| Southern | 0.063 | **0.097** | Mismatch |
| Constant | 9.285 | **8.507** | **Mismatch** |

**Fixes:**
- **Race coding** is a major culprit (Hispanic sign flips; other race missing).
- **Age effect** and **South** significance differ; that often happens when N is wrong (yours 507 vs true 756) or when weights/design differences exist. Match the paper’s sample and any weighting/recoding decisions.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): β and constant
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157* | **-0.151** **(true: -0.151**)** | Close, but stars differ |
| Income pc | -0.050 | **-0.009** | **Big mismatch** |
| Prestige | -0.011 | **-0.022** | Mismatch |
| Female | -0.122* | **-0.095***? (true shows -0.095*) | Mismatch |
| Age | 0.083 | **0.110***? (true shows 0.110*) | Mismatch |
| Black | 0.107 | 0.049 | Mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.028 | 0.031 | Close |
| Other race | blank/NA | **0.053** | **Missing entirely** |
| Cons Prot | 0.037 | 0.066 | Mismatch |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.024 | Match |
| Southern | 0.065 | **0.121** | **Mismatch** |
| Political intolerance | 0.190** | **0.164*** | **Mismatch** |
| Constant | 7.360 | **6.516** | **Mismatch** |

**Fixes:**
- The **income β** discrepancy is too large to be rounding—likely **income variable coding/scaling differs** (e.g., you used a different income measure, different per-capita transform, winsorization, logged vs raw, or included extreme values).
- Your **political intolerance** variable seems different too (and your model 3 N=286 vs true 503 suggests you’re losing far too many cases on `pol_intol` or other covariates).

---

## 4) Standard errors and p-values: interpretation mismatch

### Mismatch
- The **True Results explicitly state SEs are not reported in Table 1** (and only stars are shown).
- Your generated models report **p-values and significance stars derived from SEs**, and they don’t line up with the paper’s stars (e.g., Age in Model 2 is only * in generated but *** in true; Southern differs, etc.).

### How to fix
- If the goal is to “match Table 1,” you should:
  1. **Report standardized βs and stars only** (no SE/p) OR
  2. If you keep p-values, make clear they are **recomputed from your replication**, not “extracted from the paper.”
- To match the paper’s stars, you must match:
  - **sample (N)**,
  - **variable coding**, and possibly
  - **weighting/design corrections** (if the paper used weights or specific treatment of missing data).

---

## 5) “Other race” handling is wrong in both Models 2–3

### Mismatch
- Generated: “Other race” is **NaN** and listed as **dropped**.
- True: “Other race” has **β=0.005** (Model 2) and **β=0.053** (Model 3).

### How to fix
- Recode `otherrace` correctly so it varies.
- Ensure the model includes it (and that the reference category matches the paper—usually White omitted).

---

## 6) Outcome and key predictor naming: potential mismatch (`pol_intol` vs “Political intolerance”)

### Issue
- Your missingness table lists `pol_intol`, while Model 3 lists “Political intolerance”. That’s fine as labeling, but the **distribution and missingness** are extreme: **47% missing**.
- True model 3 N is 503; your model 3 N is 286, implying additional avoidable losses beyond `pol_intol` missingness.

### How to fix
- Confirm `pol_intol` is constructed exactly as in the paper (same items, same range, same handling of “don’t know/refused/not asked”).
- Avoid unnecessary listwise deletion by ensuring other covariates (especially race) aren’t incorrectly set to missing.

## Summary of the concrete discrepancies to correct first (highest impact)
1. **Race/ethnicity dummies are misconstructed** (`hispanic` looks inverted; `otherrace` has no 1s). Fix coding and reference group.
2. **Sample size is wrong in every model** (especially Models 2–3). Fix missing-data handling driven by bad recodes; align to the paper’s inclusion criteria.
3. **Income per capita and political intolerance appear differently coded/scaled** than in the paper (huge β mismatches). Reproduce the paper’s exact transformations.
4. **Don’t claim Table 1 SEs/p-values are “extracted”**—Table 1 doesn’t report them. Either omit them or clearly label them as replication-derived.

If you share the code you used to construct `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `inc_pc`, and `pol_intol` (plus any filtering/na-handling), I can point to the exact lines causing the N collapse and coefficient sign flips.
