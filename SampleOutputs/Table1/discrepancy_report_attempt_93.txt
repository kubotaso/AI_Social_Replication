============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**. I separate (A) fit statistics/sample sizes, (B) coefficients/significance, (C) variable naming/coding, and (D) interpretation/reporting conventions, then explain exactly how to fix each so the generated output reproduces Table 1.

---

## A) Fit statistics and sample sizes (major mismatches)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s. Ensure you are using the same inclusion rules and missing-data handling as the paper. Most likely issues:
    - You used **listwise deletion** on variables not in Model 1 (e.g., demographics or pol_intol) unintentionally.
    - You used a restricted dataset/year or applied filters not used in the paper.
  - **Implementation fix:** When fitting Model 1, subset only to cases nonmissing on **(educ_yrs, inc_pc, prestg80_v, outcome)**—and do *not* require nonmissing on demographic/political intolerance variables.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **R² 0.088**, **Adj R² 0.085**
  - True: **R² 0.107**, **Adj R² 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample matches (N=787) and variable construction matches the paper, R² should move toward the true values. If not, you are not using the same variable definitions (e.g., income scaling, prestige measure, or outcome coding).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** Generated Model 2 is being fit on a sample that’s far too restricted—almost certainly because you required nonmissingness on **pol_intol** (or something else) even though Model 2 does not include it.
  - **Implementation fix:** For Model 2, use listwise deletion **only on Model-2 variables** (SES + demographics) and the outcome.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **0.139 / 0.120**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Again, first fix N/sample; then verify variable codings.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Your Model 3 sample is much smaller than the paper’s. Your “missingness” table shows **pol_intol is ~47% missing**, which would indeed crush N if you use a version with lots of missing data or impose extra restrictions.
  - **Implementation fix options:**
    1. **Use the same political intolerance variable construction** as the paper (often a scale built from multiple items with specific rules).
    2. Ensure you’re using the **same GSS year/subset** and that you’re not accidentally requiring additional variables with missingness (e.g., “hispanic” has 35% missing in your table; that alone can severely reduce N if coded improperly).
    3. Do listwise deletion only on Model 3 variables (including pol_intol), not on anything else.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **0.149 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Sample mismatch is the biggest driver. Also suggests variable coding differences (income scaling; race/ethnicity handling; regional coding; intolerance scaling).

## B) Coefficients and significance (systematic mismatches)

### Important note about what should match
The **True Results** are **standardized coefficients (β)** (except constants unstandardized). Your generated tables include both **b** (unstandardized) and **beta**; your “Table1-style” output appears to display **beta** (good). So comparisons should be made between:
- True “Coefficient (β)” **vs.** Generated “Table1” (or Generated `beta`).

### Model 1 coefficients (β)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (acceptable-ish) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | slightly high |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | off |

**Fix:** once N and variable construction match, education and constant should align better. If not:
- confirm **education is measured identically** (years vs degrees recode).
- confirm **outcome** “num_genres_disliked” matches paper’s exact coding (range, exclusions, DK handling).
- confirm **prestige** measure is the same (paper says “occupational prestige”; you use `prestg80_v`—verify it matches what they used).

### Model 2 coefficients (β) — multiple sign/size errors
| Variable | Generated β | True β | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | too large (more negative) |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | close |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | too negative |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close |
| **Age** | **0.103***? (only * in your table) | **0.140*** | clearly understated; star level wrong |
| **Black** | **0.100** | **0.029** | far too large |
| **Hispanic** | **0.074** | **-0.029** | **sign mismatch** |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **0.005** | sign mismatch |
| Cons Prot | 0.087 | 0.059 | too large |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | close |
| **Southern** | **0.061** | **0.097** | too small; star missing (true is **) |
| Constant | 8.675 | 8.507 | off |

**Fixes (most likely causes):**
1. **Race/ethnicity coding is wrong.**
   - Your “missingness” table shows `hispanic` has **35% missing**—that is a red flag. In many GSS extracts, Hispanic ethnicity is not missing that much; you may be using a variable/version with structural missing or you recoded it incorrectly.
   - Also, you likely created mutually exclusive race categories incorrectly (e.g., coding Hispanic as a race dummy while also keeping Black/Other race dummies in a way that changes the reference group).
   - **Fix:** replicate the paper’s exact dummy scheme and reference category (usually: White non-Hispanic as reference; Black, Hispanic, Other as dummies). Ensure Hispanic is coded as ethnicity and overrides race if that’s what the paper did (or not—must match their method).

2. **Age effect too small**
   - Could be because of sample restriction (your N is 507 vs 756).
   - Could also be because age is coded differently (`age_v` vs age at interview; top-coding; excluding <18; etc.)
   - **Fix:** use the same age variable and sample; ensure linear age term only.

3. **Southern coefficient and significance wrong**
   - Again likely sample + coding (South definition can vary: Census region vs “born in South” vs residence).
   - **Fix:** confirm `south` matches the paper’s “Southern” indicator (usually region of residence).

### Model 3 coefficients (β)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | close size; **star mismatch** |
| **Income pc** | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | **huge mismatch** |
| Prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | modest mismatch |
| Female | -0.127* | -0.095* | too negative |
| **Age** | **0.091 (ns)** | **0.110* ** | significance mismatch |
| Black | 0.060 | 0.049 | close |
| **Hispanic** | **-0.030** | **0.031** | sign mismatch |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| Cons Prot | 0.036 | 0.066 | too small |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | matches |
| **Southern** | **0.068 (ns)** | **0.121** ** | too small; significance mismatch |
| **Political intolerance** | **0.184** ** | **0.164*** | too large; star mismatch |
| **Constant** | **7.999** | **6.516** | large mismatch |

**Fixes:**
1. **Income per capita is not the same variable/scale as the paper’s**
   - Your Model 3 income β is wildly off from True (-0.052 vs -0.009). That’s not a small sampling fluctuation; it usually indicates:
     - different income definition (raw household income vs per-capita),
     - different transformation (logged vs not),
     - different standardization method,
     - or wrong sample (selection into the intolerance subsample changes income-outcome correlation).
   - **Fix:** confirm paper’s income construction and reproduce it exactly. If the paper used a specific GSS income recode, use that rather than a homemade per-capita variable unless you can verify equivalence.

2. **Political intolerance variable mismatch**
   - Paper’s β: **0.164***; yours: **0.184**.
   - Also your label says **(0–15)**. If the paper’s intolerance scale is constructed differently (different items, handling of missing, rescaling), the coefficient and N will differ.
   - **Fix:** reconstruct intolerance exactly as described in the paper (items included, coding, summing/averaging, required number of valid items, any rescale).

3. **Race/ethnicity still mis-coded**
   - Hispanic sign mismatch persists in Model 3.
   - **Fix:** same as Model 2—correct dummy construction and reference category.

4. **Constant is far off**
   - Constants depend strongly on:
     - outcome scale,
     - sample composition,
     - and how dummies are defined.
   - **Fix:** after fixing sample and coding, constant should move toward 6.516.

## C) Variable name and labeling mismatches (presentation + potential coding)

These aren’t just cosmetic; they often reveal coding errors.

1. **Outcome name differs**
   - Generated uses `num_genres_disliked` (fine), but make sure it matches “Number of Music Genres Disliked” exactly (same range, exclusions).

2. **Political intolerance label**
   - Generated: “Political intolerance (0–15)”
   - True: “Political intolerance” (scale not shown)
   - **Fix:** verify range. If your range is 0–15 but paper’s isn’t (or uses standardized scale), you won’t match.

3. **Race/ethnicity variables**
   - Generated includes `Black`, `Hispanic`, `Other race` but your missingness table suggests a problematic `hispanic` measure with high missingness.
   - **Fix:** use the same GSS Hispanic indicator the authors used and recode missing values correctly (don’t treat “not asked” as missing if the paper restricted to a sample where it was asked, etc.).

---

## D) Interpretation/reporting mismatches

1. **You report p-values/SEs; Table 1 does not**
   - True Results explicitly: **SE not reported**; only stars.
   - Generated output includes p-values and would imply exact star cutoffs from your model.
   - **Fix (to match Table 1):** suppress SE/p columns in the final “Table 1 style” display and show only standardized β plus stars, and unstandardized constants.

2. **Star thresholds differ**
   - True uses: * < .05, ** < .01, *** < .001.
   - Your stars appear consistent in definition, but because coefficients/p-values differ (from sample/coding issues), the star patterns differ (e.g., Education in Model 3 is ** in true but * in generated; intolerance is *** in true but ** in generated).
   - **Fix:** Once coefficients/p-values match (via correct sample and coding), star patterns will match automatically.

---

## Highest-priority fixes (in order)

1. **Fix the estimation samples per model**
   - Model 1 must yield **N=787**
   - Model 2 must yield **N=756**
   - Model 3 must yield **N=503**
   - Do *model-specific* listwise deletion; do not carry forward restrictions from other models.

2. **Recode race/ethnicity to match the paper**
   - Resolve the Hispanic variable’s high missingness and ensure mutually exclusive categories and correct reference group.

3. **Reconstruct key predictors exactly**
   - **Income per capita**: confirm definition/transformation used in the paper.
   - **Political intolerance**: replicate item construction and missing-data rules.

4. **Ensure you are outputting standardized coefficients (β)**
   - Table 1 compares standardized βs (except constants). Your “Table1-style” seems to do this; just ensure the standardization method matches (typically standardizing all non-dummy continuous predictors; some authors also standardize dummies—unclear; must match paper).

If you share (1) your code for constructing `inc_pc`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, and `pol_intol`, and (2) your model-fitting code (including any `drop_na`/filter steps), I can point to the exact line(s) causing the N collapse and the Hispanic/sign errors, and specify the correct recodes to reproduce Table 1 exactly.
