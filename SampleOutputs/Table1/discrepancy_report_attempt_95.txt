Score: 28/100
============================================================

Below I compare your **Generated Results** against the **True Results (Table 1 from the paper)**. I list *every* mismatch by category (fit stats, coefficients, variable naming/coding, stars/interpretation), then explain what to change so the generated output matches the paper.

---

## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (n, R², adjusted R²)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **n**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** your analytic sample is too small by 40 cases. To match the paper, replicate *their exact missing-data handling* (likely listwise deletion on only the variables in Model 1, and possibly different recodes for income/prestige/education). Ensure you’re using the same GSS 1993 subset and same exclusions.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, **Adj R² = 0.085**
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, **Adj R² = 0.104**
  - **Fix:** once the sample and variable construction match, R² should move. Also confirm:
    - OLS with same weights (paper likely unweighted unless stated; if you used weights, you won’t match).
    - Same dependent-variable construction (see §4).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **n**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** massive case loss indicates you likely (a) merged in political intolerance early and did listwise deletion across *all* variables for all models, or (b) used a wrong missingness rule (e.g., dropped if *any* model-3-only variable missing).  
  - To match Table 1, each model should be estimated on the **max available n for that model**, not a progressively shrinking panel unless the paper did that (it didn’t; n bounces: 787 → 756 → 503).

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.139 / 0.120**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** align sample + coding. Also note your generated Adj R² is *much* lower than true, consistent with incorrect n and/or wrong variable coding.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **n**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** same issue—your model 3 sample is far too small. Your missingness table shows `pol_intol` missing ~47%; that would still leave ~850 nonmissing, not 286. So you are dropping additional cases unnecessarily (likely because other predictors are being set to missing by recodes, or you used complete.cases over an overly broad set of variables, or you accidentally restricted to those nonmissing on *both* DV variants).

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.149 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** again: correct n, correct variables, correct standardization (see next).

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized β in the paper vs your outputs)

### Key structural issue
The **paper reports standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors, and **unstandardized constants**. Your “Table1” columns appear to use the **beta** column (standardized) for predictors and raw constant—good in principle—but many β values still don’t match.

Below are *every coefficient mismatch* in the Table1-style outputs (since that’s what Table 1 is).

---

## 3) Model-by-model coefficient comparison (Generated Table1 vs True)

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | small difference |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | small difference |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | mismatch |

**Fixes:**
- **Sample alignment** (n should be 787) is the biggest driver.
- Ensure **standardization procedure matches**: β in OLS is equivalent to running OLS on z-scored variables (predictors and outcome) *or* transforming from unstandardized using sample SDs. If you standardized using a different sample than the paper (e.g., after dropping more cases), β won’t match even if b’s do.
- Constant mismatch suggests either different coding of DV or different sample mean.

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.265*** | **-0.246*** | too negative |
| Income pc | **-0.051** | **-0.054** | small difference |
| Prestige | **-0.011** | **-0.006** | too negative |
| Female | **-0.085***? (star as *) | **-0.083***? (star as *) | β close, OK |
| Age | **0.103*** (star *) | **0.140*** | **major mismatch + wrong significance** |
| Black | **0.100** | **0.029** | major mismatch |
| Hispanic | **0.074** | **-0.029** | **sign flips** |
| Other race | **-0.027** | **0.005** | sign mismatch |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.087** | **0.059** | mismatch |
| No religion | **-0.015** | **-0.012** | small difference |
| Southern | **0.061** | **0.097** | mismatch + significance differs (true is **)** |
| Constant | **8.675** | **8.507** | mismatch |

**Fixes (critical):**
1. **Race variable construction is almost certainly wrong.** Your “Black/Hispanic/Other race” effects are wildly off and some flip signs. Common causes:
   - Using overlapping race/ethnicity indicators (e.g., “Hispanic” not mutually exclusive with Black/White), while the paper likely uses **mutually exclusive categories** or a specific GSS coding scheme.
   - Wrong reference category (e.g., omitting White but also accidentally omitting another group, or including all dummies with intercept).
   - Mislabeling: your `hispanic` variable missingness is huge (35%), suggesting you might be using a variable that is not the paper’s Hispanic indicator or is coded differently in 1993.
   **To fix:** replicate the paper’s exact race coding. Typically: White (reference), Black dummy, Hispanic dummy, Other dummy, mutually exclusive.

2. **Southern and Age are off** (β and stars). This again points to:
   - wrong sample (your n=507 vs 756),
   - wrong coding (age centered/recoded? south definition?), or
   - incorrect standardization sample.

3. **Do not carry Model 3 missingness into Model 2.** Model 2 must use all cases nonmissing on Model 2 variables only.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.155*** (star *) | **-0.151** (star **) | β close, **stars differ** |
| Income pc | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | **major mismatch** |
| Prestige | **-0.015** | **-0.022** | mismatch |
| Female | **-0.127*** (star *) | **-0.095* ** | too negative |
| Age | **0.091** (ns) | **0.110* ** | mismatch + significance |
| Black | **0.060** | **0.049** | close-ish |
| Hispanic | **-0.030** | **0.031** | **sign flips** |
| Other race | **0.053** | **0.053** | matches |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.036** | **0.066** | mismatch |
| No religion | **0.023** | **0.024** | matches |
| Southern | **0.068** | **0.121** | major mismatch + stars differ (true **) |
| Political intolerance | **0.184** (star **) | **0.164*** | β too large + wrong stars |
| Constant | **7.999** | **6.516** | major mismatch |

**Fixes (critical):**
1. **Your “Household income per capita” in Model 3 is not matching at all** (true β is -0.009 ~ near zero; yours is -0.052). That strongly suggests:
   - income was scaled differently (e.g., you created *per capita* incorrectly, or used a different income variable, or logged it),
   - or you standardized using the wrong SD (because of wrong sample / recode).
   **To fix:** verify the paper’s *exact* “household income per capita” construction: numerator, household size, treatment of top-codes, and missing codes.

2. **Political intolerance β and stars don’t match.**
   - Generated: 0.184** (p≈0.0038)
   - True: 0.164*** (p<.001)
   With correct n=503 (not 286) you’d generally get *smaller SE and smaller p*, so this may correct itself once n is fixed. But your β is also too high.
   **To fix:** correct sample + confirm political intolerance scale construction (0–15) matches exactly (items, missing handling, and direction).

3. **Constant mismatch** is large (7.999 vs 6.516), pointing to a different DV mean due to:
   - different DV construction (very likely), and/or
   - different sample composition (definitely).

## 4) Variable name / definition mismatches

### Dependent variable labeling
- True DV: **Number of Music Genres Disliked**
- Your missingness table uses: `num_genres_disliked` (looks right), but your model outputs label nothing about the DV and your constants differ substantially from the paper.
- **Fix:** ensure DV is constructed identically (same set of genre items, same dislike coding, same missing-data rule across items). A common mismatch is:
  - counting “don’t know / never heard” as 0 instead of missing,
  - including/excluding certain genres,
  - using “like/dislike” vs “favorite” items.

### Hispanic indicator
- Your missingness shows `hispanic` missing ~35%. In many GSS years, Hispanic ethnicity variables can have large missingness depending on which variable is used.
- **Fix:** use the *same* Hispanic measure the paper used for 1993 and recode missing codes properly (e.g., 8/9 to NA). Ensure mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories.

### Political intolerance scale (0–15)
- You label it “(0–15)” which matches the paper, but your n collapse suggests your construction may be forcing additional missingness (e.g., requiring complete responses on all items rather than allowing partial with prorating—though the paper likely used a strict sum with listwise across those items).
- **Fix:** replicate the paper’s rule for scale construction (sum of exactly which items; how many must be present; how DK/refused treated).

---

## 5) Standard errors: reported vs not reported (interpretation mismatch)

- The **True Results explicitly state SE are not reported** in Table 1.
- Your generated results include **p-values and significance** based on SEs and hypothesis tests.
- This isn’t “wrong” statistically, but it **does not match what Table 1 contains**. More importantly, your stars don’t match the paper’s stars in several places (Age, Southern, Education in Model 3, Political intolerance).
- **Fix:** If the goal is to match Table 1:
  1. Output **only standardized β and stars** (and constants unstandardized).
  2. Compute stars using the same thresholds (you used the same cutoffs, but your p-values are different because your n/coding differ).
  3. Don’t present SEs if you’re claiming to reproduce the table.

---

## 6) Significance/star mismatches (not exhaustive earlier—here are the clear ones)

- **Model 2 Age**
  - Generated: Age has * (p≈0.019)
  - True: Age has ***  
  **Fix:** correct sample/coding; with n=756 and β=0.140 it should be highly significant.

- **Model 2 Southern**
  - Generated: no star (p≈0.161)
  - True: ** (significant)  
  **Fix:** south coding and sample.

- **Model 3 Education**
  - Generated: * (p≈0.028)
  - True: **  
  **Fix:** sample size and standardization.

- **Model 3 Age**
  - Generated: ns (p≈0.129)
  - True: *  
  **Fix:** sample size/coding.

- **Model 3 Political intolerance**
  - Generated: **  
  - True: ***  
  **Fix:** n must be 503; scale must match.

## 7) How to fix the workflow so the generated analysis matches the paper

### A. Estimate each model on the correct sample
- Model 1: listwise deletion on **DV + (educ, inc_pc, prestige)** only → target **n=787**
- Model 2: listwise deletion on **DV + Model 2 predictors** → target **n=756**
- Model 3: listwise deletion on **DV + Model 3 predictors (incl. pol intolerance)** → target **n=503**
Do **not** use one global `complete.cases()` over all variables for all models.

### B. Match variable construction exactly
1. DV: reproduce the paper’s “# genres disliked” index precisely.
2. Income per capita: same numerator, household-size divisor, and missing/top-code handling.
3. Race/ethnicity: create **mutually exclusive** dummies with correct reference category.
4. Political intolerance: same items and scoring; treat DK/NA exactly as paper.

### C. Standardized coefficients (β)
To match β:
- Either compute β from the model using the **same analytic sample** as the model, or run regression on z-scored variables (but keep constant reported as unstandardized per paper convention—Table 1 constants are unstandardized).
- Do not standardize using the full dataset if the model uses a subset after listwise deletion.

### D. Output format to match Table 1
- Report: β and stars for predictors; unstandardized constant; R², adj R², n.
- Omit SEs (or clearly separate them as “additional output not in paper”).

If you want, paste (1) your code/recode rules for **DV**, **inc_pc**, **race/ethnicity**, and **pol_intol**, and (2) how you define the model samples. I can point to the exact step causing the n collapse and the race/income coefficient divergences.
