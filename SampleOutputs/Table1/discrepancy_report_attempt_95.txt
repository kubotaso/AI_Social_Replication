Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True Results (Table 1)**, grouped into (A) variable naming/definition, (B) coefficients & significance, (C) constants/fit/N, and (D) interpretation/reporting. For each mismatch I state **what’s wrong** and **how to fix it** so the generated analysis reproduces the printed table.

---

## A) Variable names / measurement alignment

### A1) DV name mismatch (presentation)
- **Generated:** “DV: Number of music genres disliked” with variable shown as `num_genres_disliked`.
- **True:** “Number of music genres disliked” (same concept).
- **Fix:** Presentation-only. Ensure the DV label in the table matches the paper’s phrasing; the variable name in code can remain `num_genres_disliked`.

### A2) Predictor naming mismatches (presentation)
These don’t necessarily change estimates, but they must match Table 1 labels.
- **Generated terms:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`
- **True labels:** Education; Household income per capita; Occupational prestige; Female; Black; Hispanic; Other race; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern; Political intolerance
- **Fix:** Relabel terms in the output table to the paper’s names. (This is required to “match” Table 1 even if the underlying variables are correct.)

### A3) **Big methodological mismatch:** standardization / what is being reported
- **True table prints:** **standardized OLS coefficients only** (and explicitly does **not** print SEs).
- **Generated output includes:** a “beta_std” column (fine), **but also prints a second line per coefficient that looks like SEs** in `table1_style`.
- **Fix:**  
  1) If you want to match Table 1 exactly: **remove SE rows entirely** and report only standardized coefficients + stars.  
  2) Ensure your “standardized coefficients” are computed the same way as the authors: typically either  
     - run OLS on **z-scored X and z-scored Y**, or  
     - compute β\* = b × sd(X)/sd(Y) from unstandardized OLS.  
     Your current β\* values don’t match Table 1, suggesting the standardization approach and/or sample differs (see sections B/C).

## B) Coefficient and significance mismatches (by model)

I’m comparing **Generated beta_std** to the **True standardized coefficients**.

### Model 1 (SES Model)

| Term | Generated β\* | True β\* | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.310*** | **-0.322*** | coefficient off |
| Household income per capita | -0.038 (ns) | **-0.037 (ns)** | close but not exact |
| Occupational prestige | 0.025 (ns) | **0.016 (ns)** | coefficient off |

**Fix:** These differences are consistent with **using a different estimation sample and/or different standardization procedure** than the paper. To match: (1) match the paper’s **N=787** (see Section C1), and (2) replicate the paper’s exact standardization.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic Model)

| Term | Generated β\* | True β\* | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.289*** | **-0.246*** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.049 (ns) | **-0.054 (ns)** | not exact |
| Prestige | -0.003 (ns) | **-0.006 (ns)** | not exact |
| Female | -0.080 (p=.058, no star) | **-0.083\*** | star missing; coef slightly off |
| Age | 0.097* | **0.140*** | too small + wrong sig level |
| Black | 0.098 (ns) | **0.029 (ns)** | very different sign/magnitude |
| Hispanic | -0.075 (ns) | **-0.029 (ns)** | too negative |
| Other race | -0.016 (ns) | **0.005 (ns)** | wrong sign |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.091* | **0.059 (ns)** | false positive star + too large |
| No religion | -0.012 (ns) | **-0.012 (ns)** | matches closely |
| Southern | 0.067 (ns) | **0.097\*\*** | too small + missing significance |

**Fix:** This pattern strongly suggests the model is **not estimated on the same cases and/or not coded the same way** as the paper (especially race, southern, and age). To match Table 1:
1) **Use the paper’s sample for Model 2 (N=756)** (your N=505 is far smaller).  
2) Ensure coding matches the authors’:  
   - Race dummies must use the **same reference category** (almost certainly White as reference with indicators for Black/Hispanic/Other). Your huge discrepancies for `black` and `other_race` are classic signs of a **different baseline or different construction** (e.g., “nonwhite” vs “black”; or “other_race” overlapping with black/hispanic; or hispanic treated as race vs ethnicity).  
   - `southern` likely defined from region; verify you’re using the **same region classification** and not excluding many cases via missingness.
3) Standardize consistently (as above).

### Model 3 (Political Intolerance Model)

| Term | Generated β\* | True β\* | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.162* | **-0.151\*\*** | coef off; sig level off |
| Income pc | -0.051 (ns) | **-0.009 (ns)** | very different |
| Prestige | -0.012 (ns) | **-0.022 (ns)** | not exact |
| Female | -0.121* | **-0.095\*** | too negative |
| Age | 0.077 (ns) | **0.110\*** | too small + missing star |
| Black | 0.062 (ns) | **0.049 (ns)** | close-ish but not exact |
| Hispanic | 0.030 (ns) | **0.031 (ns)** | close |
| Other race | 0.052 (ns) | **0.053 (ns)** | close |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.039 (ns) | **0.066 (ns)** | smaller |
| No religion | 0.025 (ns) | **0.024 (ns)** | close |
| Southern | 0.069 (ns) | **0.121\*\*** | much smaller + missing sig |
| Political intolerance | 0.181** | **0.164\*\*\*** | too large; wrong sig |

**Fix:** Again, the dominant issue is **sample mismatch** (paper N=503 vs your N=284) and possibly **different construction of the political intolerance scale** (your diagnostics show “items answered min 0 max 15,” suggesting a 0–15 additive count/scale; the paper’s may be standardized, averaged, or differently coded/missing-handled). To match:
1) Replicate the intolerance index exactly (item selection, reverse coding, allowed missing, scaling).  
2) Match the model’s estimation sample to N=503 (listwise deletion rules and variable missingness handling must match the authors’).  
3) Use the same standardization procedure for coefficients.

---

## C) Model fit, constants, N: major mismatches

### C1) **Number of cases (N) — all three models are wrong**
- **Generated:** N=748, 505, 284  
- **True:** N=787, 756, 503

This is not a small discrepancy: it is the main reason coefficients and p-values diverge.

**What’s causing it in your output:** your missingness tables show large missingness for `hispanic` (298 missing) and `political_intolerance` (402 missing). The paper’s samples are much larger, so they either:
- coded missing differently (e.g., recoded “DK/NA” to a category; used different source variables), and/or
- allowed partial nonresponse on the intolerance scale (e.g., average of available items rather than requiring all), and/or
- did not drop `hispanic` for “missing” the way you did (e.g., Hispanic may be derived from a different variable with broader coverage).

**Fix:** To match N, you must match **their inclusion rules**:
- Rebuild `hispanic` so it is observed for (nearly) everyone in the analysis year.
- Rebuild `political_intolerance` using the same items and the same missing-data rule (often “compute scale if at least k of m items answered”).
- Apply the same year restriction, filters, and listwise deletion set per model as the authors.

### C2) R² / Adjusted R² mismatches
- **SES model:** Generated R²=0.097 vs True 0.107
- **Demographic model:** Generated R²≈0.152 matches True 0.151 closely (but Adj R² off: 0.133 vs 0.139) — still affected by N/df differences.
- **Political intolerance model:** Generated R²=0.145 vs True 0.169

**Fix:** Once N and variable construction match, R² should align closely. If not, it indicates remaining differences in coding (especially intolerance scale and region/race variables).

### C3) Constants are off
- **Generated constants:** 10.848; 9.860; 7.784  
- **True constants:** 10.920; 8.507; 6.516

**Important:** With standardized coefficients, constants typically come from the *unstandardized* model (or from a model where only Xs are standardized, etc.). The paper prints constants alongside standardized betas—this is common but requires replicating their exact procedure.

**Fix:** Determine how the authors produced Table 1:
- If they ran unstandardized OLS and then converted slopes to standardized betas, the constant should be from the unstandardized regression.
- If they standardized Y (and maybe X), the constant changes (often ~0 if Y is z-scored).
To match, replicate their exact method and report the constant the same way they did.

---

## D) Standard errors and interpretation/reporting mismatches

### D1) Standard errors are shown but shouldn’t be (per “True Results” note)
- **Generated `table1_style`:** prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like an SE.
- **True Table 1:** **does not print SEs**.

**Fix:** Remove SE lines from the table output. If you want to keep SEs for your own appendix, label it clearly as “SE (not in original Table 1)” and do not present it as a match.

### D2) Significance stars are inconsistent with the true table
Examples:
- **Demographic model:** `female` is not starred in generated (p=.058) but is * in true table.
- **Age:** generated only * but true is ***.
- **Southern:** generated none but true is ** in Demographic and ** in Political Intolerance.
- **Political intolerance:** generated ** but true is ***.

**Fix:** Stars will not match until (1) coefficients and (2) standard errors/p-values match—which depends on matching N, coding, and standardization. Also confirm you’re using **two-tailed** tests with the same df and the same significance thresholds.

## What to change so the generated analysis matches Table 1 (action checklist)

1) **Recreate the exact analysis samples** to hit the printed N:
   - Model 1 should yield **N=787**
   - Model 2 should yield **N=756**
   - Model 3 should yield **N=503**
   This likely requires fixing `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` construction and missing-data handling.

2) **Rebuild key variables to match the paper’s definitions**
   - `hispanic`: ensure it’s derived from the same ethnicity question and coded for nearly all respondents; don’t inadvertently treat “not asked” as missing.
   - race dummies: ensure mutually exclusive categories and correct reference (likely White).
   - `southern`: confirm region coding matches the paper and isn’t missing for many cases.
   - `political_intolerance`: replicate item set, reverse-coding, scaling, and minimum-answered-items rule.

3) **Match standardized coefficient computation**
   - Use the same procedure the authors used (z-scoring approach vs post-hoc standardization from unstandardized OLS).
   - Confirm whether weights were used; if the paper applied survey weights and you didn’t, you will not match.

4) **Match the table format**
   - Report **only standardized coefficients + stars**, no SEs (since Table 1 doesn’t include them).
   - Use the same variable labels and ordering as Table 1.
   - Report constants/R²/Adj R²/N as printed once the above is aligned.

If you share (a) the code used to construct `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) any weighting/year-filter steps, I can point to the exact step(s) responsible for the N collapse (756→505 and 503→284) and the race/southern coefficient distortions.
