Score: 25/100
============================================================

Below is a complete discrepancy audit between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1 from the PDF)**, covering **variable naming, coefficients, “standard errors,” fit statistics, N, and interpretation/significance**—plus exactly what to change so the generated analysis matches the printed table.

---

## 1) The biggest structural error: **your table prints “standard errors,” but the true table has none**

### Mismatch
- **Generated table1_style** shows a second line under each coefficient that looks like a **standard error** (e.g., educ in Model 1: `-0.310***` then `-0.038`).
- **True Results explicitly state**: Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only and does not print standard errors**.

### How to fix
- Remove standard error rows entirely from the displayed table.
- If you must show uncertainty, you need to compute SEs from the microdata—but then you **cannot claim** they match the PDF table, because the PDF didn’t report them. Label them as “SEs computed from replication data” and expect them not to match.

**Bottom line:** to match Table 1, output **only standardized betas and stars**, no SEs.

---

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas): **many coefficients do not match the true table**

I list each variable where **Generated beta ≠ True beta**, by model.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.310*** | **-0.322*** | wrong magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.038 | **-0.037** | very close but not exact |
| Prestige | 0.025 | **0.016** | wrong magnitude |
| Constant | 10.848 | **10.920** | wrong |
| R² | 0.097 | **0.107** | wrong |
| Adj. R² | 0.094 | **0.104** | wrong |
| N | 748 | **787** | wrong sample size |

**Fix:** You are not estimating on the same sample and/or not using the same standardization and variable construction as the PDF.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.290*** | **-0.246*** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.052 | **-0.054** | close but not exact |
| Prestige | -0.002 | **-0.006** | slightly off |
| Female | -0.083 (no star) | **-0.083***? Actually **-0.083\*** | missing significance star |
| Age | 0.083 (no star) | **0.140*** | too small + wrong sig |
| Black | 0.121 | **0.029** | wrong sign/magnitude |
| Hispanic | -0.085 | **-0.029** | wrong magnitude |
| Other race | -0.012 | **0.005** | wrong sign |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.075 | **0.059** | off |
| No religion | -0.021 | **-0.012** | off |
| Southern | 0.068 | **0.097** | too small + wrong sig |
| Constant | 10.052 | **8.507** | very wrong |
| R² | 0.149 | **0.151** | close but not exact |
| Adj. R² | 0.129 | **0.139** | wrong |
| N | 477 | **756** | drastically wrong |

**Fix:** again, your estimation sample is far smaller (477 vs 756) and your covariates don’t appear to be coded/standardized the same way as the printed analysis.

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.161* | **-0.151\*\*** | wrong magnitude and wrong star level |
| Income pc | -0.058 | **-0.009** | completely different |
| Prestige | -0.018 | **-0.022** | close-ish |
| Female | -0.127* | **-0.095\*** | too negative |
| Age | 0.078 | **0.110\*** | too small + missing star |
| Black | 0.102 | **0.049** | too large |
| Hispanic | 0.013 | **0.031** | off |
| Other race | 0.066 | **0.053** | off |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.024 | **0.066** | off a lot |
| No religion | 0.013 | **0.024** | off |
| Southern | 0.069 | **0.121\*\*** | too small + missing stars |
| Political intolerance | 0.154* | **0.164\*\*\*** | wrong magnitude + wrong star level |
| Constant | 7.997 | **6.516** | wrong |
| R² | 0.144 | **0.169** | wrong |
| Adj. R² | 0.104 | **0.148** | wrong |
| N | 269 | **503** | drastically wrong |

**Fix:** same underlying issues: sample restriction/casewise deletion, coding differences, and possibly a different year/subsample than Table 1.

---

## 3) Variable name mismatches (less severe, but still discrepancies)

### Mismatch
Generated uses:
- `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, etc.

True table labels:
- “Education”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, etc.

This is mostly a **labeling/presentation** mismatch, not necessarily a statistical one.

### How to fix
- Relabel variables in the output to match Table 1 exactly (capitalization and wording).
- Ensure the *construct* matches too: e.g., `prestg80` sounds like 1980 prestige score—Table 1 says “Occupational prestige” (likely that same measure, but confirm).

---

## 4) Significance-star mismatches: your p-values/stars don’t match the printed table

Examples:
- **Model 2 Female**: Generated p = 0.058 → no star, but True table shows `-0.083*`.
- **Model 2 Age**: Generated p = 0.066 → no star, but True shows `0.140***`.
- **Model 3 Political intolerance**: Generated p = 0.020 → `*`, True shows `***`.

### What this implies
Even if coefficients were close, the **sampling distribution** you’re using is not the one underlying the PDF table—usually because:
- different **N** (and yours is much smaller),
- different **weights/design correction** (GSS often uses weights; some papers use robust SEs),
- different **variable coding** (binary vs multi-category, missing-value handling),
- different **subsample definition**.

### How to fix
To match printed stars, you must replicate:
1) the **exact sample definition** (years, age restrictions, inclusion criteria),
2) the **same missing-data rules** used by the authors,
3) whether they used **weights** and what kind,
4) the same **standardization procedure** for betas (see next section).

---

## 5) Standardization mismatch likely: you may be computing “standardized coefficients” differently than the paper

### Why this matters
“Standardized OLS coefficients” can mean:
- standardize **X only** (beta = b * SDx),
- standardize **both X and Y** (beta = b * SDx/SDy) — most common,
- compute “beta” after z-scoring all variables then running OLS.

If you use a different method than the authors, coefficients won’t match.

### How to fix
- Replicate the paper’s beta method:
  - If Table 1 says “standardized OLS coefficients,” it usually means **both DV and IVs standardized** within the estimation sample for that model.
- Ensure standardization happens **after** applying the model’s listwise deletion (since SDs change by sample).

---

## 6) Your estimation samples (N) are drastically wrong vs the true table

### Mismatch
True Ns:
- Model 1: **787**
- Model 2: **756**
- Model 3: **503**

Generated Ns:
- Model 1: **748**
- Model 2: **477**
- Model 3: **269**

### Diagnosed cause (from your own diagnostics)
Your missingness tables show enormous missingness for `hispanic` (298 missing) and `political_intolerance` (402 missing), producing extreme listwise deletion.

But in the true table, Model 2 still has N=756, and Model 3 has N=503, which means the authors’ versions of those variables **cannot be missing for that many cases**, or they handled missings differently.

### How to fix (most likely)
1) **Recode race/ethnicity** so “not Hispanic” is coded 0 rather than missing.
   - In many datasets, “Hispanic” is not asked of everyone or is encoded with special codes.
   - Your `hispanic` variable likely treats “inapplicable/not asked” as missing instead of 0.
2) **Recode political intolerance** to avoid turning valid nonresponses into NA incorrectly.
   - Many GSS-derived items have codes like 8/9 for DK/NA; if you’re dropping too aggressively, N collapses.
3) Ensure you are using the **same year(s)** and the same filter used in the PDF Table 1.

**Concrete correction target:** After recodes, your listwise N should move toward **787 / 756 / 503**.

---

## 7) Constants and fit statistics don’t match (because your models aren’t the same)

Constants are far off (e.g., Model 2 constant 10.052 vs true 8.507). With standardized betas, constants depend on whether DV is standardized and on centering. If Table 1 includes unstandardized constants but standardized slopes, that also must be replicated exactly.

### How to fix
- Verify whether the paper:
  - reports **standardized slopes** but **unstandardized constant**, or
  - standardizes DV too (in which case intercept is typically ~0).
- Replicate their convention exactly.
- Recompute R²/Adj R² from the correctly specified model and correct N.

---

## 8) Interpretation mismatches (what your generated output implicitly claims)

### Mismatch
Your generated output implies:
- standard errors are known and shown,
- p-values correspond to those SEs,
- the sample is the correct analytic sample.

All three are inconsistent with the “True Results” description (no SEs printed; Ns don’t match).

### How to fix the written interpretation
- Do **not** claim “the paper reports SE=…” or “p=…” from Table 1.
- If discussing significance, use only the **stars as printed** in the true table.
- If you compute p-values yourself, explicitly label it as a **replication estimate**, and it should still use the same N and coding as the paper.

---

## 9) Checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1 exactly

1) **Use the exact analytic sample** used in the PDF (year(s), any restrictions).
2) **Recode missing values properly** (especially `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`):
   - Convert “not asked / inapplicable” to substantive 0 when appropriate (for indicator variables).
   - Convert DK/REFUSED to missing only if the authors did.
3) **Construct predictors exactly as the authors did** (dummy codings and reference groups).
4) **Standardize coefficients using the same procedure** and do it **within each model’s estimation sample**.
5) **Do not print SEs** if the goal is to match Table 1.
6) Output **Ns, R², Adj R², and constants** to match the printed table; if they still differ, your sample/coding is still off.

If you tell me what dataset/codebook you used (e.g., GSS year, variable codings for race/ethnicity and intolerance items, and whether weights were used), I can pinpoint the *exact* recode(s) causing the N collapse and the biggest coefficient divergences (especially the wildly wrong Black/Hispanic coefficients in Model 2).
