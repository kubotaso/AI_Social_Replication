## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is missing in the generated models (Models 2 and 3)**
- **True Table 1 includes:** *Hispanic* in Demographic and Political Intolerance models (with coefficients −0.029 and 0.031).
- **Generated output:** explicitly says “Hispanic omitted … (ETHNIC mapping not confirmed)” and the models do not include any Hispanic indicator.

**How to fix**
- Recreate the *Hispanic* dummy exactly as the paper did (same source variable, same coding, same reference group).
- Ensure the race/ethnicity set matches Table 1: `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` (with White as the omitted category).
- Then re-run Models 2 and 3 including `hispanic`.

---

### B. **Religious dummy specification likely mismatched**
Compare Conservative Protestant:
- **True:** 0.059 (Model 2), 0.066 (Model 3), neither significant.
- **Generated:** 0.093* (Model 2), 0.084 (Model 3), with Model 2 significant.

This is often a sign that the *religion categories / reference group* do not match the article.

**How to fix**
- Verify how the article defines “Conservative Protestant” (denomination coding rules).
- Verify the **reference category** for religion (e.g., mainline Protestant? Catholic? “other religion”?). Your generated code uses `conservative_protestant` and `no_religion` only; if the paper used a fuller set or a different omitted group, coefficients will differ.
- Recode religion to mirror the paper’s categories and omitted category exactly.

---

### C. **“Household income per capita” vs `income_pc` (name is fine, construction may not be)**
- The *name* mismatch is minor (label vs variable name), but the *construction* may differ:
  - equivalization rule,
  - inflation adjustment,
  - top-coding,
  - handling of missing/don’t know,
  - whether it is logged vs linear.
- Your coefficients are close (e.g., −0.054 vs −0.053; −0.009 vs −0.015), suggesting you’re “in the neighborhood,” but not identical.

**How to fix**
- Replicate the exact income-per-capita construction used in the paper (divide household income by household size? by adults? apply CPI? etc.).
- Use the same transformation (none/log) and same treatment of missingness.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (by model)

Below I list every coefficient that differs from the true printed value.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | -0.310*** | too small in magnitude |
| Household income per capita | -0.037 | -0.038 | tiny difference |
| Occupational prestige | 0.016 | 0.025 | too large |

**Fixes**
- Ensure standardization matches the paper (see Section 4).
- Ensure sample size matches the paper (see Section 3): your N=748 vs true N=787 is a big red flag and will shift coefficients.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.244*** | tiny difference |
| Income per capita | -0.054 | -0.053 | tiny difference |
| Occupational prestige | -0.006 | 0.005 | sign differs |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.083* | matches |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.127*** | too small |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.021 | too small |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | — | omitted (major mismatch) |
| Other race | 0.005 | -0.000 | slightly off (and sign) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.059 | 0.093* | too large + wrong sig |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.001 | too close to 0 |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.065 (p=.068) | too small + wrong sig |

**Fixes**
- Add Hispanic (required).
- Recreate religion coding and omitted category.
- Match sample and missing-data handling to recover N=756.
- Ensure age is coded identically (years? centered? top-coded? restricted range?).

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.145* | smaller magnitude + weaker sig |
| Income per capita | -0.009 | -0.015 | too negative |
| Occupational prestige | -0.022 | -0.010 | too close to 0 |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.100* | close |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.057 | much smaller + loses sig |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.056 | close |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | — | omitted (major mismatch) |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.049 | close |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.066 | 0.084 | too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.026 | matches closely |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.064 | much smaller + loses sig |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.178*** | too large |

**Fixes**
- Add Hispanic.
- Fix political intolerance measure construction (scale range, direction, standardization).
- Match N=503 (you have 421), and match listwise deletion rules the paper used.

---

## 3) Fit statistics / sample size mismatches (these are not “small”)

### A. N differs in every model
- **True:** 787, 756, 503  
- **Generated:** 748, 746, 421

This alone can explain many coefficient/significance differences.

**How to fix**
1. Identify exactly why you’re losing cases:
   - Your diagnostics show large missingness for `political_intolerance` (402 missing; only 491 nonmissing; then model N=421 after listwise deletion).
2. Replicate the paper’s inclusion rules:
   - same year/wave restriction,
   - same handling of “don’t know/refused,”
   - same construction of the DV and index items,
   - same decision about listwise deletion vs partial missingness on indices.

### B. R² and Adjusted R² do not match
- **True R²:** 0.107, 0.151, 0.169  
- **Generated R²:** 0.097, 0.133, 0.132  
Model 3 is especially far off (0.132 vs 0.169), consistent with (i) different sample and/or (ii) different intolerance measure.

**How to fix**
- Once you match the sample and variable construction, R² should move toward the published values.

### C. Constant differs (expected if standardization differs)
- **True constants:** 10.920, 8.507, 6.516  
- **Generated constants:** 10.848, 8.619, 7.077  

Since the table is “standardized coefficients,” intercepts are especially sensitive to whether:
- Y was standardized (usually not, in “beta” tables),
- X’s were standardized,
- you computed betas by post-hoc rescaling rather than actually running a model on standardized variables.

**How to fix**
- Confirm what is standardized:
  - In sociology tables, “standardized coefficients” typically means **beta weights for predictors** while DV remains in original units; intercept is then just the raw intercept from the unstandardized model.
- Compute betas the same way the paper did (see next section).

---

## 4) Standard errors: generated output is not just “different”—it’s invalid relative to “true”
- **True results note:** the printed table **does not report standard errors at all**.
- **Generated table** prints a second line under each coefficient that *looks like* an SE row (e.g., education has “-0.310***” then “-0.038”), but these do not correspond to anything in the true table and cannot be “matched.”

**How to fix**
- If your goal is to match the published Table 1, **remove standard errors entirely** from the table output.
- Alternatively, if you keep SEs for your own computation, label them clearly as “SE (computed, not reported in article)” and do *not* treat mismatches as replication failures of the printed table.

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches

### A. Education significance in Model 3
- **True:** −0.151 ** (p < .01)
- **Generated:** −0.145 * (p < .05)

**Fix**
- This will typically resolve when you:
  - restore the published N (503 vs 421),
  - match the intolerance scale and Hispanic inclusion,
  - match standardization method.

### B. Southern and Age lose significance in Model 3 (and Southern in Model 2)
- **True:** Southern is ** in Models 2 and 3; Age is * in Model 3
- **Generated:** Southern not significant; Age not significant in Model 3

**Fix**
- Again points to sample mismatch and/or different coding (especially for political intolerance, which can soak up variance differently if built differently).

---

## 6) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the “true” table

1. **Add Hispanic** exactly as in the paper (coding + reference group).
2. **Match the analytic sample**:
   - same year restriction,
   - same exclusion criteria,
   - same missing-data rules (especially for intolerance and income).
3. **Rebuild “political intolerance”** to match the article:
   - same items,
   - same direction,
   - same scale construction (sum/mean, required nonmissing items),
   - same standardization (if any).
4. **Replicate religion coding** (Conservative Protestant / No religion and the omitted category).
5. **Compute standardized coefficients (betas) the same way**:
   - either run OLS on standardized X’s (and unstandardized Y) or compute betas from the raw model using the exact formula the authors used.
6. **Output formatting**:
   - remove SEs from Table 1 (since the published table doesn’t have them),
   - ensure stars are based on the same two-tailed thresholds.

If you paste the code you used to (a) construct Hispanic, (b) construct political intolerance, and (c) standardize coefficients, I can pinpoint which specific coding/standardization step is driving the biggest coefficient gaps (especially Age, Southern, and intolerance).
