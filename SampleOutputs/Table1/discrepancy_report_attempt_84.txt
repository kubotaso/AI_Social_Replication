## 1) Fit statistics / sample sizes (major mismatches)

### Model 1
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your generated model is using a stricter complete-case rule (likely listwise deletion with a different missingness pattern, recodes, or additional variables inadvertently included). Reproduce the paper’s N by:
    - Ensuring you’re using **GSS 1993 only** and the same universe restrictions as the paper.
    - Using the **same coding/filters** for `inc_pc`, `educ_yrs`, `prestg80_v` as the original (e.g., handling DK/NA as missing exactly as GSS conventions; applying any top-coding or transformations the paper used).
    - Verifying you did **not** accidentally include cases where DV is missing or include extra controls in the Model 1 estimation dataset.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, **Adj R² = 0.085**
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, **Adj R² = 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample and coding match (especially N=787), R² should move toward the published value. If not:
    - Confirm the DV is exactly **“Number of Music Genres Disliked”** and matches the paper’s construction (range, included genres, missing handling).
    - Confirm OLS with the same weighting decision as the paper (weighted vs unweighted can change R²).

### Model 2
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is too large a drop to be “normal” listwise deletion unless you accidentally introduced extra missingness (e.g., treated valid categories as missing, or merged in a variable with lots of missing and then did listwise deletion).
  - Specifically, your own “missingness” table shows `hispanic` has **35% missing**, which is suspicious for a race/ethnicity indicator (often it’s derived and should not be missing for that many). That alone can crush N.
  - **Fix actions:**
    - Reconstruct race/ethnicity dummies exactly as the paper: typically from **RACE** and **HISPANIC** (or a combined measure) with explicit reference categories; **do not** leave `hispanic` as missing if the paper treats non-Hispanic as 0.
    - If the original created “Hispanic” as a dummy where missing implies “not asked / not in sample year,” you must mimic that rule.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **0.139 / 0.120**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Again, primarily sample/coding alignment.

### Model 3
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Your `pol_intol` has **47% missing**, causing the collapse. The paper’s Model 3 N=503 implies political intolerance was available for far more cases than your constructed variable.
  - Likely error: you constructed `pol_intol` from multiple items but required **all items nonmissing**; the paper likely used a **scale with partial completion rules** (e.g., mean of available items if at least k answered) or a different intolerance measure.
  - **Fix actions:**
    - Identify the exact intolerance items and scaling method used in the paper.
    - Replicate its missing-data rule (e.g., compute the scale if respondent answered at least X items; rescale to 0–15).
    - Alternatively, if the paper used a prebuilt variable, use that exact variable.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **0.149 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Will not match until N and scale construction match.

## 2) Coefficients: standardized (β) vs unstandardized (b) confusion

The **true table reports standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constants**. Your generated outputs mix:
- `model*_full`: shows **unstandardized b** and also `beta`
- `*_table1style`: appears to report the **beta** values (good)

So comparisons should be made between **your “Table1style” betas** and the **true β**s, and between **your constant (b)** and the **true constant**.

---

## 3) Term-by-term mismatches (β and constants)

### Model 1 (SES)
**True β vs Generated Table1style**
- Education
  - Generated: **-0.292***  
  - True: **-0.322***  
  - **Mismatch:** magnitude too small.
  - **Fix:** sample/coding mismatch (N differs) and/or education coding differs (years vs degree categories converted incorrectly).

- Household income per capita
  - Generated: **-0.039**
  - True: **-0.037**
  - **Small mismatch.** Likely sample/coding.

- Occupational prestige
  - Generated: **0.020**
  - True: **0.016**
  - **Small mismatch.**

- Constant
  - Generated: **10.638**
  - True: **10.920**
  - **Mismatch.** Typically shifts with sample differences and/or centering/standardization errors (but constant should be from unstandardized model).
  - **Fix:** Ensure constant comes from the **same unstandardized OLS** with the same sample.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
Key mismatches:

- Education
  - Generated: **-0.265***  
  - True: **-0.246***  
  - **Mismatch** (direction same, magnitude different).

- Household income per capita
  - Generated: **-0.051**
  - True: **-0.054**
  - **Close.**

- Occupational prestige
  - Generated: **-0.011**
  - True: **-0.006**
  - **Mismatch** (small).

- Female
  - Generated: **-0.085***? actually **-0.085*** in table shows `-0.085*`
  - True: **-0.083***? true is **-0.083*** with one star (*)
  - **Close** (stars consistent: *). Good.

- Age (big problem)
  - Generated: **0.103***? shown as `0.103*` (only * in your table)
  - True: **0.140*** (***)
  - **Mismatch in magnitude and significance.**
  - **Fix:** sample/coding mismatch is likely (your N is far smaller). Also check whether age is in **years** vs recoded (e.g., decades). If you accidentally scaled age (e.g., /10), β changes less, but significance could change due to SEs and N.

- Black (big sign mismatch in inference, not sign)
  - Generated: **0.100**
  - True: **0.029**
  - **Mismatch** (much larger in your results).
  - **Fix:** race coding/reference category likely differs. If “Black” dummy is not mutually exclusive with “Hispanic” (or you treated “Hispanic” as missing often), coefficients will be distorted.

- Hispanic (sign mismatch)
  - Generated: **+0.074**
  - True: **-0.029**
  - **Mismatch in sign.**
  - **Fix:** your “Hispanic” variable construction is almost certainly wrong (and your missingness shows it’s missing for ~35%). The paper likely coded Hispanic as 1/0 with non-Hispanic explicitly 0, not missing.

- Other race (sign mismatch)
  - Generated: **-0.027**
  - True: **+0.005**
  - **Mismatch in sign (though tiny in true).**
  - **Fix:** same race/ethnicity coding issue (mutually exclusive categories, correct reference group).

- Conservative Protestant
  - Generated: **0.087**
  - True: **0.059**
  - **Mismatch** (bigger in yours). Could be sample differences; also check denomination coding.

- No religion
  - Generated: **-0.015**
  - True: **-0.012**
  - **Close.**

- Southern (important)
  - Generated: **0.061** (no stars)
  - True: **0.097** (**)  
  - **Mismatch in magnitude and significance.**
  - **Fix:** region coding (South definition), weighting, and especially N (you have much less power).

- Constant
  - Generated: **8.675**
  - True: **8.507**
  - **Mismatch** (moderate). Again consistent with sample/coding differences.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance model)
- Education
  - Generated: **-0.155***? (your table: `-0.155*`)
  - True: **-0.151** (**)  
  - **Magnitude close but significance differs** (* vs **).
  - **Fix:** N difference (286 vs 503) directly affects p-values/stars.

- Household income per capita (large mismatch)
  - Generated: **-0.052**
  - True: **-0.009**
  - **Big mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** Almost certainly not the same sample and/or not the same income-per-capita construction. Also possible you used raw `inc_pc` with extreme skew and the paper used a transformation (e.g., log) but still reported standardized β; however, the true β being near zero suggests either different variable or different treatment of missing/topcodes.

- Occupational prestige
  - Generated: **-0.015**
  - True: **-0.022**
  - **Moderate mismatch.**

- Female
  - Generated: **-0.127* **
  - True: **-0.095* **
  - **Mismatch** (stronger in yours).

- Age
  - Generated: **0.091** (no star)
  - True: **0.110* **
  - **Mismatch in significance.**
  - **Fix:** N and coding.

- Black
  - Generated: **0.060**
  - True: **0.049**
  - **Close.**

- Hispanic (sign mismatch)
  - Generated: **-0.030**
  - True: **+0.031**
  - **Mismatch in sign.**
  - **Fix:** Hispanic coding again.

- Conservative Protestant
  - Generated: **0.036**
  - True: **0.066**
  - **Mismatch**.

- Southern
  - Generated: **0.068**
  - True: **0.121** (**)  
  - **Mismatch** (and significance).

- Political intolerance
  - Generated: **0.184** (**)
  - True: **0.164** (***)
  - **Mismatch in magnitude and stars.**
  - **Fix:** Your intolerance scale differs and your N is much smaller; also your p-value is 0.0038 (**) whereas paper has ***—consistent with larger N and/or less noisy scale in the original.

- Constant (very large mismatch)
  - Generated: **7.999**
  - True: **6.516**
  - **Big mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** points to a different estimation sample and/or different coding/scaling of DV or key covariates.

## 4) Standard errors: required vs not in the “true” table

- **True results:** SEs are explicitly **not reported** in the paper’s Table 1.
- **Generated results:** you report p-values and thus have SEs implicitly (though not printed).
- **Mismatch:** If your task is “match Table 1,” you should not be presenting SE-based inference if the goal is exact replication of the printed table. Also, your stars should be based on **the same p-values the paper would have had**, which you cannot guarantee unless the dataset/coding/weights match.

**Fix:**
- For a faithful “Table 1 style” replication, output **standardized β and stars only**, omit SEs/p-values.
- Internally, compute stars from the model, but understand stars won’t match until N/coding/weights do.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by your workflow

### A) “Political intolerance (0–15)” label
- You label it “0–15,” but your missingness suggests it may not be constructed the same way as the paper’s scale.
- **Fix:** verify:
  - min/max actually 0 and 15 in your computed variable
  - items, scoring direction, and rescaling match the paper

### B) Race/ethnicity variables are likely not mutually exclusive / incorrectly missing
- The huge missingness for `hispanic` and sign flips for Hispanic across models strongly indicate miscoding.
- **Fix:** build race/ethnicity categories to match the paper’s definitions, commonly:
  - `black` = 1 if Black, else 0
  - `hispanic` = 1 if Hispanic (any race) else 0 **(not missing)**
  - `otherrace` = 1 if neither White, Black, nor Hispanic (or some specified rule)
  - reference group = White non-Hispanic
  - Ensure categories are mutually exclusive if that’s how the paper did it (many papers treat Hispanic as separate from race and handle overlap explicitly—match theirs).

---

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true table

1) **Recreate the exact analytic sample per model**
   - Restrict to **GSS 1993** and the paper’s eligibility rules.
   - For each model, do listwise deletion on **exactly** the variables in that model—nothing else.
   - Confirm resulting N matches: **787, 756, 503**.

2) **Recode missing values correctly**
   - In GSS-style data, values like 8/9/98/99 (DK/NA) must be set to missing consistently.
   - Ensure dummies (female, black, hispanic, south, cons_prot, norelig) are **0/1 with 0 meaning “no,” not missing** unless genuinely unknown.

3) **Rebuild key constructed variables to match the paper**
   - `num_genres_disliked`: confirm the genre list, counting rule, and treatment of “don’t know”.
   - `inc_pc`: confirm formula (household income / household size?), inflation adjustments, topcodes, and whether zeros/negatives are handled.
   - `pol_intol`: confirm exact items and scale construction, and the minimum answered-items rule.

4) **Match weighting and variance estimation**
   - If the paper used weights, apply them (and then use OLS with weights).
   - If the paper used unweighted OLS, remove weights.

5) **Report the same estimand as Table 1**
   - Output **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constant**.
   - Apply stars using the stated thresholds.

If you share the code you used to construct `hispanic` and `pol_intol` (and whether you weighted the regression), I can point to the exact lines causing the N collapse and the sign flips.
