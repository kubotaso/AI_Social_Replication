Score: 45/100
============================================================

Below is a term-by-term audit of **everything that does not match** between the Generated Results and the True Results, plus what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the paper’s Table 1.

---

## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (n, R², adj. R²)

### Model 1 (SES)
**Generated:** n=747, R²=0.0883, adj R²=0.0846  
**True:** n=787, R²=0.107, adj R²=0.104  

**What’s wrong**
- Your analytic sample is smaller (747 vs 787), which will change coefficients and fit.
- R² and adj R² are correspondingly off.

**How to fix**
- Recreate the paper’s **case selection rules** for Model 1:
  - Use **GSS 1993** only and the same weighting (if the paper used weights).
  - Use the same **listwise deletion** set: for Model 1, drop only cases missing **DV + (education, income pc, prestige)**.
- Verify that your constructed variables match the paper’s operationalizations (especially income-per-capita and prestige coding); incorrect construction can also reduce valid n.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
**Generated:** n=745, R²=0.1262, adj R²=0.1131  
**True:** n=756, R²=0.151, adj R²=0.139  

**What’s wrong**
- n is still too small (745 vs 756), so you’re dropping extra cases (likely due to missingness or different coding of race/religion/region).
- R²/adj R² are too low.

**How to fix**
- Apply **listwise deletion on exactly the Model 2 variables**, but ensure the same missing handling as the paper:
  - If you created dummies that turn some cases into missing (e.g., “No religion” missing because religion was missing), you may be excluding more than intended.
- Confirm dummy reference categories and coding (see sections below). Incorrect dummy construction won’t always change n, but it will change fit and betas.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
**Generated:** n=503, R²=0.1531, adj R²=0.1324  
**True:** n=503, R²=0.169, adj R²=0.148  

**What’s wrong**
- n matches, but R²/adj R² are still too low: your specification/standardization/coding differs from the paper.

**How to fix**
- Since n matches, the remaining mismatch is almost certainly due to:
  - using **unstandardized** coefficients where standardized are expected (or vice versa),
  - different variable coding (notably “Other race” looks badly miscoded; see below),
  - or different scaling of political intolerance.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized β) and constants

### Key issue: you are mixing *unstandardized b* and *standardized β*
- The True Results are **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors, and **constants are unstandardized**.
- Your output contains both `b` and `beta`, but:
  - your “table1style” appears to print **beta values**, which is correct in principle,
  - yet many betas still don’t match the paper, implying coding/sample/spec mismatch.

### Model 1 coefficients
**Education (β)**
- Generated: **-0.292***  
- True: **-0.322***  
Mismatch.

**Income pc (β)**
- Generated: **-0.039**  
- True: **-0.037**  
Close, minor mismatch.

**Occupational prestige (β)**
- Generated: **0.020**  
- True: **0.016**  
Mismatch.

**Constant**
- Generated: **10.638**  
- True: **10.920**  
Mismatch.

**Fix**
- First fix **n** to 787 (Section 1). If n is off, β and constant will drift.
- Ensure prestige measure matches the paper (you have `prestg80_v`; confirm the paper’s prestige variable and treatment of missing codes).
- Ensure the DV is identical: “Number of music genres disliked” must match the paper’s count construction and range.

### Model 2 coefficients
Compare standardized β from your `model2_table1style` to True:

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.229*** | -0.246*** | No |
| Income pc | -0.055 | -0.054 | Close |
| Prestige | 0.005 | -0.006 | **Wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | Close |
| Age | 0.126*** | 0.140*** | No |
| Black | 0.017 | 0.029 | No |
| Hispanic | 0.055 | -0.029 | **Wrong sign** |
| Other race | 0.022 | 0.005 | No |
| Cons Prot | 0.101** | 0.059 | No (too large, different sig) |
| No religion | 0.000 | -0.012 | No |
| Southern | 0.070 | 0.097** | No (and sig mismatch) |
| Constant | 8.139 | 8.507 | No |
| R² | 0.126 | 0.151 | No |
| n | 745 | 756 | No |

**Fixes (specific)**
1. **Hispanic sign reversal** is a red-flag for dummy coding:
   - You likely coded Hispanic as `1 = Hispanic`, but the paper may define the race categories differently (e.g., Hispanic treated as ethnicity with race categories excluding Hispanic; or different reference group).
   - Fix by reproducing the paper’s exact race/ethnicity construction: typically mutually exclusive dummies with **White non-Hispanic as the reference**.
2. **Prestige sign mismatch** (0.005 vs -0.006):
   - Often caused by using the wrong prestige variable, reverse coding, or including prestige for respondents without valid occupational info differently than the paper.
3. **Conservative Protestant too large**:
   - Likely a definition mismatch (which denominations counted; how “Conservative Protestant” created).
4. **Southern significance differs**:
   - Could be due to sample mismatch (n) and/or region coding (South vs not; whether “South” defined as Census South, or “born in South,” etc.).

### Model 3 coefficients
Compare standardized β from your `model3_table1style` to True:

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.126* | -0.151** | No (size + significance) |
| Income pc | -0.021 | -0.009 | No |
| Prestige | 0.010 | -0.022 | **Wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.096* | -0.095* | Essentially yes |
| Age | 0.082 | 0.110* | No (and sig mismatch) |
| Black | 0.051 | 0.049 | Close |
| Hispanic | 0.082 | 0.031 | No |
| Other race | 0.116** | 0.053 | No |
| Cons Prot | 0.100* | 0.066 | No |
| No religion | 0.037 | 0.024 | No |
| Southern | 0.071 | 0.121** | No (and sig mismatch) |
| Political intolerance | 0.198*** | 0.164*** | No (too large) |
| Constant | 5.817 | 6.516 | No |
| R² | 0.153 | 0.169 | No |
| n | 503 | 503 | Yes |

**Major additional discrepancy: “Other race” unstandardized b**
- Generated Model 3 has **b = 8.975** for Other race, which is wildly implausible given the DV scale (and inconsistent with the standardized β=0.116).
- This strongly suggests **a coding/data error** (e.g., Other race variable mistakenly takes huge values or is not 0/1; or DV is miscoded for that subgroup).

**Fixes (specific)**
1. **Check dummy variables are 0/1** (especially `otherrace`). Ensure no stray values like 2, 3, 9, 99, 8, 98 remain.
2. **Political intolerance scaling**
   - Your term label says “(0–15)”; the paper’s “Political intolerance” must be on the exact same scale.
   - If you standardized differently (e.g., z-scored with different sample or used a different set of items), β will change.
3. **Prestige sign mismatch again**: same issue as Model 2.

## 3) Standard errors: present in generated output but not in true table
**Generated:** p-values and significance stars imply you computed SEs and t-tests.  
**True:** Table 1 reports **no SEs** (only stars), and it reports **standardized β**.

**What’s wrong**
- Not wrong to compute SEs, but if your goal is to “match Table 1,” you should **not present SEs** as if they were extracted from the table.
- More importantly: significance stars in your output should match the table’s stars; several do not.

**How to fix**
- When producing the “Table 1 style” output:
  - Report **standardized β only** for predictors, **unstandardized constant**, and the same stars thresholds.
  - Suppress SEs if you’re claiming they come from the paper.
- To match stars, you must match the paper’s:
  - sample (n),
  - weighting (if any),
  - coding,
  - and whether tests are two-tailed (paper says two-tailed).

## 4) Variable-name / label mismatches and mapping problems

### Political intolerance variable naming
- Generated missingness table uses `pol_intol`
- Model table labels: “Political intolerance (0–15)”
- True table: “Political intolerance”

This is fine as labeling, but it becomes a problem if the constructed `pol_intol` does not equal the paper’s index.

**Fix**
- Document and verify the exact construction: item set, recoding, and range. Confirm min/max and mean/SD in the analytic sample match what the paper implies.

### DV name mismatch
- Missingness lists `num_genres_disliked` with 44% missing.
- True: DV is “Number of Music Genres Disliked (GSS 1993)”

High missingness is plausible, but if your DV construction differs (e.g., different set of genres, different missing handling), results will differ.

**Fix**
- Rebuild DV exactly:
  - same genre items,
  - same rules for “disliked” vs other responses,
  - same handling of “don’t know / not asked / missing”.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by the generated tables

### You implicitly treat “Table1” values as standardized β (correct), but your narrative would be wrong if you interpret them as unstandardized
- Your tables include both `b` and `beta`. If any write-up interprets `b` magnitudes (e.g., “one more year of education reduces disliked genres by 0.37”), that would **not match the paper’s Table 1**, which is in standardized units (except constant).

**Fix**
- Interpret predictors using **standard deviation units** (β), not raw units, if you are matching Table 1.
- If you want raw-unit interpretation, then you must compare to a different (unreported) table—not Table 1.

---

## 6) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the True Results

1. **Replicate the sample definition per model**
   - Model 1: listwise delete on DV + educ + income pc + prestige → should yield **n=787**
   - Model 2: listwise delete on DV + Model2 covariates → **n=756**
   - Model 3: listwise delete on DV + Model3 covariates incl. intolerance → **n=503** (already matches)

2. **Verify dummy codings**
   - Race/ethnicity dummies must match the paper’s mutually exclusive categories and reference group.
   - Ensure all dummies are strictly **0/1** and missing codes are handled.

3. **Reconstruct key composites exactly**
   - `inc_pc`: verify household income per capita formula and treatment of household size/income brackets.
   - `pol_intol`: verify items and scaling; ensure it matches the paper’s measure.
   - `cons_prot` and `norelig`: verify classification rules.

4. **Standardize predictors the same way**
   - To match Table 1’s β, compute **standardized coefficients** using the same analytic sample for each model.
   - Easiest: run OLS on standardized variables (z-scores) for predictors and outcome, **but** keep the constant separately if you want it unstandardized like the paper. Alternatively compute β post-estimation.

5. **Output formatting**
   - Predictors: report **β** only + stars
   - Constant: unstandardized
   - R², adj R², n must match exactly.

If you want, paste (a) your variable coding snippets for race/ethnicity, conservative Protestant, no religion, and political intolerance, and (b) the exact rules you used for listwise deletion per model. With that, I can pinpoint which specific coding choice is driving the biggest sign errors (notably Hispanic and prestige) and the incorrect n in Models 1–2.
