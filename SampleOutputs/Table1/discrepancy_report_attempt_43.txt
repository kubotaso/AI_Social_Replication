Below is a line‑by‑line audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True (PDF Table 1) results**, grouped by (a) variable naming, (b) coefficients/significance, (c) fit stats/N/constant, and (d) interpretation/measurement. For each discrepancy I explain the most likely cause and exactly how to fix it so the generated analysis can reproduce Table 1.

---

## 1) Variable names / labeling mismatches

### 1.1 Education label vs `educ`
- **Generated:** term = `educ`
- **True Table 1 label:** “Education”
- **Status:** Not inherently wrong (just a naming difference), **but** you must ensure it is the *same education variable and coding* as the PDF.

**Fix**
- Confirm `educ` matches the PDF’s “Education” (years of schooling? highest degree recode?).
- In your output table, relabel `educ` → “Education” to match the PDF.

### 1.2 Income label vs `income_pc`
- **Generated:** `income_pc` with large raw values shown (e.g., 17685, 35370).
- **True Table 1 label:** “Household income per capita”
- **Status:** Naming is compatible, but this highlights a **likely construction mismatch** (see §4).

**Fix**
- Ensure the variable is exactly “household income per capita” as constructed in the article (equivalized? household size divisor? inflation year? top-coding?). If not, reconstruct accordingly.
- Relabel `income_pc` → “Household income per capita”.

### 1.3 Occupational prestige label vs `prestg80`
- **Generated:** `prestg80`
- **True Table 1 label:** “Occupational prestige”
- **Status:** Probably same concept, but confirm you used the same prestige scale (e.g., 1980 prestige score).

**Fix**
- Verify the prestige measure corresponds to the one used in the PDF.
- Relabel `prestg80` → “Occupational prestige”.

### 1.4 Political intolerance label
- **Generated:** `political_intolerance` with a rule: “sum of 15 items; allow up to 1 missing”
- **True Table 1 label:** “Political intolerance”
- **Status:** Name matches, but your **scale construction is likely not the same** (see §4.2). That will change the coefficient and N substantially.

**Fix**
- Rebuild political intolerance exactly as in the article/PDF (number of items, response coding, missing-data rule, any rescaling/standardization before modeling).

---

## 2) Coefficient and significance mismatches (by model)

Important: True Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only**. Your generated `beta_std` indicates you also standardized, so the betas *should* be comparable—yet many don’t match.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated β (std) | True β (std) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.332*** | -0.322*** | **Yes** (too negative by 0.010) |
| Income pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | **Yes** (slightly off) |
| Prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | **Yes** (substantially off) |

**Likely causes**
- Different sample (your N=758 vs true N=787; see §3.1).
- Different variable construction (esp. prestige, income; see §4).
- Different standardization approach (standardize within estimation sample vs full sample; or using weighted vs unweighted SDs).

**Fix**
1. Match the **exact analytic sample** for Model 1 used in the PDF (listwise on the same variables *and* same initial restrictions: year, age, valid responses, etc.).
2. Standardize predictors and/or outcome the same way the authors did (commonly: z-score within the analytic sample, unweighted; but confirm).
3. Verify any weights were/weren’t used. Using weights changes standardized betas.

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated β (std) | True β (std) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.302*** | -0.246*** | **Major** |
| Income pc | -0.057 | -0.054 | **Small** |
| Prestige | -0.008 | -0.006 | **Tiny** |
| Female | -0.077 (ns) | -0.083* | **Yes** (sig + magnitude) |
| Age | 0.109* | 0.140*** | **Major** |
| Black | 0.026 | 0.029 | **Small** |
| Hispanic | 0.029 | -0.029 | **Sign flip** |
| Other race | -0.016 | 0.005 | **Sign flip** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.041 | 0.059 | **Mismatch** |
| No religion | -0.016 | -0.012 | **Small** |
| Southern | 0.079 (≈p=.06) | 0.097** | **Mismatch (bigger + significant in true)** |

**Key problems indicated**
- Multiple **sign flips** (Hispanic, Other race) strongly suggest you are not using the same coding/reference group and/or not the same sample.
- Female and Southern significance differs; Age effect is much smaller in generated.

**Fix**
- **Recreate the exact dummy coding scheme** used in the article:
  - Race: confirm the reference category (usually White) and that Black/Hispanic/Other are mutually exclusive and correctly coded.
  - Sex: confirm 1=female matches authors.
  - Region: confirm “Southern” matches Census South definition used by the authors.
  - Religion: confirm “Conservative Protestant” definition; confirm “No religion” reference group (likely mainline/other).
- **Match sample restrictions** (your Model 2 N=523 vs true N=756 is drastically different; see §3.1). With correct sample size, many of these differences should shrink.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance model)

| Variable | Generated β (std) | True β (std) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.160* | -0.151** | **Yes** (sig level differs) |
| Income pc | -0.070 | -0.009 | **Major** |
| Prestige | -0.002 | -0.022 | **Mismatch** |
| Female | -0.143** | -0.095* | **Major** |
| Age | 0.077 | 0.110* | **Mismatch** |
| Black | 0.028 | 0.049 | **Mismatch** |
| Hispanic | 0.075 | 0.031 | **Mismatch** |
| Other race | 0.050 | 0.053 | Close |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.010 | 0.066 | **Major** |
| No religion | 0.020 | 0.024 | Close |
| Southern | 0.073 | 0.121** | **Major** |
| Political intolerance | 0.217*** | 0.164*** | **Major** |

**Fix priorities**
- Your political intolerance coefficient is **too large** and your N is far smaller than the true model (322 vs 503). That combination is exactly what you’d see if:
  1) you built a different intolerance scale, and/or  
  2) you used a much more restrictive missingness rule, and/or  
  3) you used the wrong survey wave/subsample.

To match the PDF:
- Rebuild the intolerance index using the **same items/coding/missing rule** as the authors.
- Use the same sample definition and handle missingness as they did (often mean across items if ≥k answered, not “sum of 15 allow 1 missing” unless that’s documented).

---

## 3) Fit statistics, constants, and sample size mismatches

### 3.1 N (number of cases) is massively wrong for Models 2 and 3
- **Generated N:** M1=758, M2=523, M3=322  
- **True N:** M1=787, M2=756, M3=503

These gaps are too large to be rounding. They indicate you are dropping far more cases than the published analysis—especially for race (Hispanic missingness) and political intolerance.

**Direct evidence from your diagnostics**
- `hispanic` nonmissing = 612 out of 893 complete DV ⇒ **281 missing** (!)
- `political_intolerance` nonmissing = 548 ⇒ **345 missing**
- Then listwise deletion yields N=523 and N=322.

But in the true table, Model 2 has **N=756**, meaning the authors did **not** have 281 missing on Hispanic in the analytic sample. That implies your `hispanic` variable is constructed incorrectly (e.g., only asked of some respondents, or you’re treating “not asked / not in universe” as missing rather than 0, or you imported it from a different wave).

**Fix**
- Recode race/ethnicity variables so that people who are not Hispanic are coded `0` (not NA).
- Ensure “inapplicable” codes (often 0/8/9/98/99) are converted appropriately, not to NA by mistake.
- Confirm you’re using the same year/wave and that race/ethnicity comes from the same respondent file.

### 3.2 Constants do not match
- **Generated constants:** 11.086, 10.088, 7.639  
- **True constants:** 10.920, 8.507, 6.516

With standardized coefficients, constants depend on whether the DV is standardized or not and on centering. The PDF table reports standardized slopes but appears to keep the DV in its original metric (since constants are ~6–11).

**Fix**
- Do **not** standardize (z-score) the DV if the goal is to reproduce the printed constant.
- Standardize only predictors (and possibly report standardized betas via post-estimation), while estimating the model on the original DV scale—matching what the authors did.

### 3.3 R² / Adjusted R² differences
- **Generated:** R² = 0.1088 / 0.1572 / 0.1670  
- **True:** R² = 0.107 / 0.151 / 0.169

Small differences can come from sample mismatch and/or weighting and/or handling of missingness. Given your N is wrong, these will not match until N and variables match.

**Fix**
- First fix sample definition (N). Then confirm whether the authors used weights and replicate that.

---

## 4) Interpretation / construction issues that likely drive the mismatches

### 4.1 You are (implicitly) treating missingness incorrectly for key covariates
The huge missingness on `hispanic` is the smoking gun. In most surveys, ethnicity is known for nearly everyone; it should not be 30% missing in the restricted sample unless mis-coded.

**Fix**
- Audit raw codes for race/ethnicity. Common pattern:
  - 1=Yes, 2=No (or similar) → should be recoded to 1/0
  - 0 / -1 / 8 / 9 / 98 / 99 represent “not asked”, “don’t know”, “refused” → decide whether authors exclude or recode; usually exclude DK/refused but **not** “not asked” if it implies “No” in a filter question.
- Ensure “Other race” is mutually exclusive with Black/Hispanic (and White as reference).

### 4.2 Political intolerance scale almost certainly not matched
- **Generated rule:** “sum of 15 items; allow up to 1 missing item”
- **True table:** doesn’t state the rule here, but your N collapse suggests your rule differs from theirs (or you are using items many people didn’t receive).

**Fix**
- Locate the paper’s measurement appendix/methods section and implement exactly:
  - which items (how many; which targets),
  - whether items are binary vs ordinal,
  - whether they use sum vs mean,
  - required number of nonmissing items,
  - whether they rescale to a fixed range.
- After reconstruction, check missingness again; your model should retain ~503 cases, not 322.

### 4.3 Standardization method mismatch
Even if you compute `beta_std`, there are multiple ways:
- standardize X and Y before regression;
- standardize only X;
- compute standardized beta post-hoc: \( \beta^* = b \cdot \frac{SD(X)}{SD(Y)} \)
- compute SDs with weights vs without weights;
- compute SDs on full sample vs estimation sample.

**Fix**
- Use the same approach the authors used (most commonly the post-hoc formula using SDs from the estimation sample, unweighted—unless stated otherwise).
- Keep DV unstandardized if you need the constant to match.

---

## 5) Standard errors: your table prints them but the “true” table does not
- **Generated table1_style** visually looks like it includes standard errors on the next line(s), but **the values shown are not actual SEs** (e.g., you show “-0.034” under a coefficient, then “0.029” on the next line—this looks like you may be printing coefficients only but formatting as if SEs exist).
- **True Table 1:** explicitly **does not report SEs**.

**Mismatch**
- Any claim that your second-line numbers are SEs would be wrong relative to the PDF.

**Fix options**
1. **To match the PDF exactly:** remove SE lines entirely and print only standardized betas and stars.  
2. **If you want to include SEs anyway:** compute and label them clearly, but then you are no longer matching “as printed” Table 1.

---

## 6) What to change so the generated analysis matches the True Table 1 (action checklist)

1. **Replicate the analytic sample**
   - Same year/wave restrictions as the paper.
   - Same inclusion criteria for DV (“music_18 complete” may be correct, but verify).
   - Use listwise deletion exactly as the authors did (or their imputation/scale rules).

2. **Fix race/ethnicity missingness**
   - Recode `hispanic` so non-Hispanic is 0, not NA.
   - Ensure mutually exclusive race dummies with White as reference.
   - Recompute Model 2 N; target **756**.

3. **Rebuild political intolerance**
   - Use the same items/coding/missing rule as the authors.
   - Recompute Model 3 N; target **503**.
   - This should pull the political intolerance beta down toward **0.164*** and adjust other covariates.

4. **Standardization**
   - Keep DV in original units if you want constants similar to 10.920 / 8.507 / 6.516.
   - Compute standardized coefficients in the same way as the paper (post-hoc standardization is safest for reproducing a table of standardized betas with an unstandardized constant).

5. **Weights (if applicable)**
   - Check whether the paper used survey weights. If yes, apply them; otherwise don’t. Weighting affects betas, R², and p-values.

If you share (a) the code used to construct `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) whether you standardized the DV or used weights, I can point to the exact line-level changes needed to reproduce the True Table 1 values.
