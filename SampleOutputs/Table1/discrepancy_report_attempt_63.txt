### 1) Fit statistics (R², adj. R², N): all three models mismatch

| Model | Item | Generated | True | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| 1 | N | 747 | 787 | Sample size too small | Use the same inclusion rules as the paper (same coding + same missing-data handling). Your missingness table suggests many missings; Model 1 should not be dropping as many as you did. Recreate the exact analytic sample for each model. |
| 1 | R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | Understated | Once the sample and standardization match the paper, refit and report correct R². |
| 1 | adj. R² | 0.085 | 0.104 | Understated | Same as above. |
| 2 | N | 745 | 756 | Too small | Align casewise deletion to paper’s definition; ensure you’re not inadvertently dropping due to factor coding/NA creation. |
| 2 | R² | 0.127 | 0.151 | Understated | Refit on correct sample/spec. |
| 2 | adj. R² | 0.114 | 0.139 | Understated | Refit on correct sample/spec. |
| 3 | N | 491 | 503 | Too small | Same issue; likely extra listwise deletion when adding pol intolerance (and/or different construction of intolerance index). |
| 3 | R² | 0.144 | 0.169 | Understated | Refit after matching pol intolerance variable construction and sample. |
| 3 | adj. R² | 0.122 | 0.148 | Understated | Refit after matching sample/spec. |

**Core problem:** your estimation pipeline is not reproducing the paper’s *analytic samples* (Ns), which then cascades into R² and coefficients.

### 2) Coefficients: mismatches in the standardized betas (β) and sometimes signs

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (constants unstandardized). Your “Table1style” panels appear to report β, but they don’t match.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | close (small difference) |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | slightly high |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | wrong |

**Fix:** after matching the sample (N=787), compute standardized coefficients exactly as the paper did (see section 4). Constant should come from the unstandardized model (as in the paper).

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.228*** | -0.246*** | too small |
| Income pc | -0.055 | -0.054 | close |
| Prestige | 0.005 | -0.006 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.084* | -0.083* | close |
| Age | 0.128*** | 0.140*** | too small |
| Black | 0.037 | 0.029 | off |
| Hispanic | 0.060 | -0.029 | **wrong sign & magnitude** |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.100** | 0.059 (no stars) | too large and wrong significance |
| No religion | 0.002 | -0.012 | wrong sign |
| Southern | 0.068 | 0.097** | too small and missing significance |
| Constant | 8.065 | 8.507 | wrong |

**Fix:** these are not “rounding” differences; they indicate **your variable coding/reference categories do not match the paper** (especially for race/ethnicity, religion, and region), and your sample differs (N 745 vs 756).

Common causes and repairs:
- **Race/ethnicity dummies**: ensure the omitted category matches the paper (typically White non-Hispanic). Your “Hispanic” is positive but should be negative in Model 2.
- **“Other race”** sign flip suggests miscoding (e.g., coded 1 for White vs non-White, or a different category composition).
- **Conservative Protestant** discrepancy suggests different definition (denomination coding) and/or different omitted religion category. Rebuild using the same RELTRAD/denomination scheme as the paper.
- **Southern**: your coefficient smaller and not significant; check South coding and sample.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.123* | -0.151** | too small and wrong significance level |
| Income pc | -0.036 | -0.009 | far too negative |
| Prestige | 0.007 | -0.022 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.098* | -0.095* | close |
| Age | 0.087 | 0.110* | too small; missing star |
| Black | 0.067 | 0.049 | off |
| Hispanic | 0.067 | 0.031 | too large |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.104* | 0.066 | too large; wrong significance |
| No religion | 0.037 | 0.024 | slightly high |
| Southern | 0.074 | 0.121** | too small; missing ** |
| Political intolerance | 0.191*** | 0.164*** | too large |
| Constant | 5.851 | 6.516 | wrong |

**Fix:** same issues as Model 2 plus **political intolerance construction**. Your missingness table shows `pol_intol` has heavy missingness; if you created it differently (different items, different scaling, different handling of DK/NA), you’ll change both N and the β size.

### 3) Standard errors: generated output is incompatible with the “true results” table

- **True**: Table 1 **does not report standard errors**; it reports β with stars.
- **Generated**: you report **unstandardized b, standardized beta, and p-values** derived from SEs.

This is not a “mistake” statistically, but it **cannot be directly compared** to the paper’s Table 1 beyond β and stars.

**Fix options:**
1. **To match the paper exactly:** suppress SE/p output and present only **β + stars** and the **unstandardized constant**, plus R²/adj R²/N.
2. **If you keep SEs:** clearly label your table as “replication with SEs (not shown in paper)” and do not claim they match Table 1.

---

### 4) Interpretation/reporting mismatches: your “Table1style” panel is internally wrong

#### (a) You mix constants and standardized coefficients without labeling
- Paper: **constant is unstandardized**, all other entries are **standardized β**.
- Your “Table1style” tables show constants alongside β, but you don’t explicitly state the constant is unstandardized.

**Fix:** label columns explicitly (e.g., “Constant (b), predictors (β)”) or provide two columns.

#### (b) `table1_panel` loses variable names (shows NaN)
Your combined table has multiple rows where `term` is `NaN`, so the reader cannot tell which coefficient is Female/Age/etc.

**Fix:** when stacking models, do a keyed merge on `term` (full join) rather than row-binding matrices with misaligned indices. Ensure `term` is preserved as a string and not dropped during pivot/widen.

---

### 5) Variable-name mismatches (labels vs underlying variables)

Generated tables use pretty labels (e.g., “Education (years)”, “Household income per capita”), while missingness uses raw names (`educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, etc.). That’s fine, but the **true table uses different names** (“Education”, etc.). The real mismatch is not cosmetics—it’s likely **coding**.

Where the generated results strongly suggest coding problems:
- **Hispanic sign** flips in Model 2 (generated +, true −).
- **Other race** flips in Model 2 (generated −, true +).
- **Prestige** flips signs in Models 2–3.
- **Southern** magnitude/significance differs notably.
- **Income per capita** is far off in Model 3 (β -0.036 vs -0.009), suggesting either scaling differences or different sample composition after adding intolerance.

**Fix:** verify each constructed variable against the paper’s definitions:
- Race/ethnicity: mutually exclusive dummies, correct reference group.
- Religion: exact “Conservative Protestant” definition and the base category.
- Region: South definition.
- Political intolerance: same items, same scoring direction, same missing handling.
- Income per capita: same transformation (e.g., raw dollars vs logged vs per-capita), same top-coding, same inflation adjustment (if any).

### 6) How to make the generated analysis match the paper (action checklist)

1. **Recreate the paper’s analytic samples (Ns)**
   - For each model, apply the same listwise deletion rules as the authors.
   - Confirm you get **N=787, 756, 503** exactly.

2. **Rebuild dummies with the same reference categories**
   - Set explicit baselines (e.g., White non-Hispanic; non–Conservative Protestant; non-South; male).
   - Confirm signs for Hispanic/Other race match Table 1 once baselines match.

3. **Match the political intolerance scale**
   - Use the identical survey items and coding.
   - Ensure higher values mean the same direction as in the paper.
   - Handle DK/NA exactly as authors (often treated as missing, but sometimes recoded).

4. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way**
   - Standardize predictors/outcome consistently (or compute β from unstandardized b using SD ratios).
   - Then present **β** for predictors and **unstandardized constant**.

5. **Fix the table-construction bug**
   - Ensure `term` is never lost (no `NaN` rows).
   - Merge model outputs by variable name rather than relying on row order.

If you share (a) your variable construction code for race/religion/intolerance and (b) the exact regression formulas you used, I can pinpoint which specific recode/reference choice is producing each sign flip (especially Hispanic/Other race and prestige).
