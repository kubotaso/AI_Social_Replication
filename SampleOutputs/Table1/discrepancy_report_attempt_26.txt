### 0) High-level problem
Your **Generated Results are not reproducing Table 1**. They differ on (a) **sample sizes**, (b) many **standardized coefficients**, (c) **constants**, and (d) **fit stats (R²/Adj. R²)**. Also, the generated table implicitly mixes **standardized betas** with **unstandardized intercepts**, and it reports **standard errors** even though the “true” Table 1 does **not** provide them.

Below I list **every mismatch** and then explain **how to fix** the analysis so the generated output matches the printed table.

---

## 1) Variable-name alignment (mostly OK, but check one likely issue)
**Matches (generated ↔ true):**
- `educ` ↔ Education  
- `income_pc` ↔ Household income per capita  
- `prestg80` ↔ Occupational prestige  
- `female` ↔ Female  
- `age` ↔ Age  
- `black` ↔ Black  
- `hispanic` ↔ Hispanic  
- `other_race` ↔ Other race  
- `conservative_protestant` ↔ Conservative Protestant  
- `no_religion` ↔ No religion  
- `southern` ↔ Southern  
- `political_intolerance` ↔ Political intolerance  
- DV: `num_genres_disliked` ↔ Number of music genres disliked

**But**: Your diagnostics show **very large missingness for `hispanic` (281 missing out of 893)** and also large missingness for `political_intolerance`. In published tables, “Hispanic” is usually a constructed dummy from a race/ethnicity variable that typically does *not* have 30% missing. That’s a red flag that:
- you may be using the wrong raw field for Hispanic, or
- you didn’t recode “don’t know / not asked / inapplicable” into 0/1 properly, or
- you accidentally treated “not Hispanic” as missing.

**Fix:** Verify the original coding and recreate the dummy exactly as the authors did (e.g., `hispanic = 1 if ethnicity == Hispanic else 0`, and set true missing only when ethnicity is genuinely missing). Do not let “No” become NA.

---

## 2) Sample size (N) mismatches — severe and drives many coefficient differences
### True N (printed)
- Model 1: **787**
- Model 2: **756**
- Model 3: **503**

### Generated N
- Model 1: **758** (−29)
- Model 2: **523** (−233)
- Model 3: **351** (−152)

**This alone guarantees you won’t match printed coefficients.**

**Main causes visible in your output:**
- You are doing **listwise deletion** on variables with a lot of missingness (especially `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`).
- You also applied a special rule for pol intolerance: `polintol_min_answered_rule = 10`, which shrinks the sample drastically.

**Fixes:**
1) **Use the same inclusion rule as the paper** for the political intolerance scale. Your rule “must answer at least 10 items” is likely *not* what the authors used. The printed N=503 implies a *much less restrictive* rule than yours (you end with 351).
   - Recreate the scale exactly (items used, coding, reversals, and the missing-data rule: e.g., allow fewer answered items, or compute mean of available items, etc.).
2) **Fix Hispanic missingness** (see Section 1) because it collapses Model 2 and Model 3 N.
3) **Match the paper’s year/subsample restriction.** Your diagnostics show `N_year_1993 = 1606`, DV nonmissing 893. The paper’s Model 1 N=787 suggests additional filters (e.g., specific age range, valid weights, valid income/prestige recodes) but not as extreme as your Model 2/3.
4) Confirm whether the paper used **weights** and/or **imputation**. If they used imputed income or coded missing categories, listwise deletion would reduce N compared to them (or vice versa). Your N pattern (huge drop in Model 2) strongly suggests your missing handling differs from theirs.

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)
Below are mismatches term-by-term. I list **Generated beta** vs **True beta** and the **difference**.

### Model 1 (SES)
- Education: **−0.332** vs **−0.322** (Δ −0.010)
- Income_pc: **−0.034** vs **−0.037** (Δ +0.003)
- Prestige: **+0.029** vs **+0.016** (Δ +0.013)

**Likely fix:** once you match N=787 and the same variable coding, these should line up closely.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- Education: **−0.302** vs **−0.246** (Δ −0.056)  ← large
- Income_pc: **−0.057** vs **−0.054** (Δ −0.003)
- Prestige: **−0.007** vs **−0.006** (Δ −0.001)
- Female: **−0.078** vs **−0.083** (Δ +0.005) (and your p-star differs; see below)
- Age: **+0.109** vs **+0.140** (Δ −0.031) ← notable
- Black: **+0.053** vs **+0.029** (Δ +0.024)
- Hispanic: **−0.017** vs **−0.029** (Δ +0.012)
- Other race: **−0.016** vs **+0.005** (sign mismatch; Δ −0.021)
- Conservative Protestant: **+0.040** vs **+0.059** (Δ −0.019)
- No religion: **−0.016** vs **−0.012** (Δ −0.004)
- Southern: **+0.079** vs **+0.097** (Δ −0.018)

**Interpretation:** These aren’t small rounding differences; they reflect a *different analytic sample and/or different recodes*. The sign flip on “Other race” is especially indicative of coding differences (or sample distortion due to missingness/selection).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- Education: **−0.150** vs **−0.151** (Δ +0.001) (close)
- Income_pc: **−0.066** vs **−0.009** (Δ −0.057) ← huge mismatch
- Prestige: **+0.005** vs **−0.022** (sign mismatch; Δ +0.027)
- Female: **−0.115** vs **−0.095** (Δ −0.020)
- Age: **+0.091** vs **+0.110** (Δ −0.019)
- Black: **+0.064** vs **+0.049** (Δ +0.015)
- Hispanic: **+0.016** vs **+0.031** (Δ −0.015)
- Other race: **+0.015** vs **+0.053** (Δ −0.038)
- Conservative Protestant: **+0.004** vs **+0.066** (Δ −0.062) ← huge
- No religion: **+0.008** vs **+0.024** (Δ −0.016)
- Southern: **+0.078** vs **+0.121** (Δ −0.043)
- Political intolerance: **+0.209** vs **+0.164** (Δ +0.045) ← substantial

**Main fix drivers (Model 3):**
- Your political intolerance measure is not constructed the same way (and your inclusion rule is too strict).
- The Model 3 sample is very different (351 vs 503).
- Income/prestige effects being radically different suggests either (a) a different sample composition due to missingness or (b) different scaling (e.g., you standardized differently, or used different income construction).

---

## 4) Significance stars / inference mismatches
Even where coefficients are close, the **stars differ** because:
- you are using a different N (affects SEs/p-values),
- possibly different SE type (classical vs robust), and
- the “true” table’s stars come from the authors’ model, not yours.

Examples:
- Model 3 Education: true is ** (p<.01) but generated is * (p<.05).
- Model 2 Age: true is *** but generated is *.
- Model 2 Female: true is * but generated has no star.
- Model 2 Southern: true is ** but generated has no star.

**Fix:** once you match the *exact sample and coding*, and use the same inference method (likely conventional OLS SEs, two-tailed), stars should match more closely. If the paper used **survey weights** or **design-based SEs**, you must replicate that.

---

## 5) “Standard errors” mismatch (conceptual/reporting discrepancy)
The **true results explicitly say Table 1 does not print standard errors**. Your generated table shows a second line under each coefficient that *looks like an SE*, but your `coefficients_long` doesn’t include SEs—only betas and p-values—so it’s unclear what those second-line numbers are.

**Fix (pick one):**
1) **Remove SE rows entirely** from the generated “Table 1” to match the printed table (best match to the PDF).
2) If you want to include SEs anyway, label them clearly and compute them correctly—but then your output will *not* match “Table 1 as printed.”

---

## 6) Constants (intercepts) mismatch
True constants:
- M1 **10.920**, M2 **8.507**, M3 **6.516**

Generated constants:
- M1 **11.086**, M2 **10.089**, M3 **7.145**

These are far off in Models 2–3.

**Important methodological point:** If Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients**, the intercept depends on whether the DV and/or predictors were standardized and on centering conventions. Many published tables show standardized betas but keep the **unstandardized intercept** from the original model. Your intercepts will only match if you fit the model the same way (unstandardized OLS on raw DV and predictors) and then compute standardized betas post hoc.

**Fix:**
- Fit OLS on the **raw variables** (DV not standardized; predictors not standardized).
- Compute standardized betas separately (e.g., \( \beta^* = b \cdot \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y} \)).
- Report: standardized betas for predictors, but the intercept from the raw model (if that’s what the paper does).
- But above all: match the **sample and variable coding**, otherwise intercepts won’t match.

---

## 7) Fit statistics mismatch (R² / Adjusted R²)
True:
- M1 R² **0.107**, Adj **0.104**
- M2 R² **0.151**, Adj **0.139**
- M3 R² **0.169**, Adj **0.148**

Generated:
- M1 R² **0.1088**, Adj **0.1052** (close)
- M2 R² **0.1572**, Adj **0.1391** (R² off)
- M3 R² **0.1511**, Adj **0.1210** (way off)

**Fix:** Again, this is mostly the wrong sample and wrong pol intolerance construction. When those match, Model 3 R² should increase to ~0.169 and Adj R² ~0.148.

---

## 8) Interpretation mismatch (implied by wrong signs/magnitudes)
Because several coefficients are wrong (e.g., income in Model 3, prestige sign, conservative Protestant near zero, southern too small, pol intolerance too large), any narrative interpretation based on the generated results would contradict the paper’s conclusions.

**Fix:** Do not interpret until replication matches:
- Same N per model,
- same standardized betas,
- same significance pattern.

# How to make the generated analysis match the true Table 1 (action checklist)

1) **Recreate the analytic samples to match N exactly**  
   - Target N: 787 / 756 / 503.  
   - Identify which variables/filters drop cases in your pipeline (your missingness tables show exactly where you’re losing them).
   - Fix recodes so that “valid zero” categories (e.g., not Hispanic) are not coded NA.

2) **Reconstruct “political intolerance” exactly as authors did**  
   - Same items, same direction, same scale.
   - Same missing-data rule (your “≥10 items answered” is likely inconsistent).
   - Validate that your final distribution and nonmissing count are consistent with N=503 once combined with other covariates.

3) **Ensure demographic dummies match reference categories**  
   - “Other race” sign flip suggests category miscoding.
   - Verify: White is omitted; Black/Hispanic/Other are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (or match the paper’s scheme).

4) **Standardization method must match**  
   - Fit raw OLS; compute standardized betas from the same sample SDs as the authors.
   - Confirm whether they standardized using sample SDs with listwise deletion for that model (most common), not the full sample.

5) **Match weighting / survey design if used**  
   - If the paper used GSS weights (or design-based SEs), incorporate them. This affects coefficients slightly and stars potentially a lot.

6) **Match what the table prints**  
   - Remove SE rows (since Table 1 doesn’t print them), or at least don’t present them as if they are from Table 1.

If you share (a) the code used to build `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) the exact filtering steps before each model, I can pinpoint the precise lines causing the N collapse and the “Other race” and income/prestige mismatches.
