Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True (Table 1) results**, covering **variable names**, **coefficients (β)**, **constants**, **fit stats**, **N**, and **interpretation/significance**—and what you must change to make the generated analysis match the table.

---

## 1) Fit statistics (N, R², adjusted R²): all three models mismatch

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Generated:** n = **747**, R² = **0.088**, Adj R² = **0.085**
- **True:** n = **787**, R² = **0.107**, Adj R² = **0.104**
- **Fix:**
  1. You are using a more restrictive complete-case subset than the paper/table. Recreate the exact sample used for Table 1 (likely different missing-data handling or variable construction).
  2. Ensure the dependent variable is exactly **“Number of music genres disliked”** (same coding, same allowable range, same year/subsample).
  3. Do not compute N per-model using “any missing in model variables” if the table used imputation, a different missingness rule, or a prefiltered analytic sample.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Generated:** n = **507**, R² = **0.138**, Adj R² = **0.119**
- **True:** n = **756**, R² = **0.151**, Adj R² = **0.139**
- **Fix:** Same underlying issue, but much worse: your N collapses to 507, implying you are losing many cases due to missingness in added covariates (race, religion, region, etc.) **or** you constructed some predictors from variables with substantial missingness (e.g., “Hispanic” in your missingness table has ~35% missing).
  - Use the **same race/ethnicity coding** as the paper (often mutually exclusive dummies derived from a non-missing race variable, not a high-missing “hispanic” item).
  - Verify “Southern”, “Conservative Protestant”, “No religion” are built from low-missing core variables.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Generated:** n = **286**, R² = **0.150**, Adj R² = **0.113**
- **True:** n = **503**, R² = **0.169**, Adj R² = **0.148**
- **Fix:** Your **political intolerance** variable has ~47% missing in your own missingness output, which is likely not how the paper handled it. To match Table 1:
  - Reconstruct “political intolerance” exactly as in the paper (item selection, scoring, handling of “don’t know/refused/not asked”).
  - Confirm you are using the same GSS year and that the intolerance items were asked of the same respondents.
  - If the paper used a broader intolerance measure with fewer missing values (or recoded missing differently), replicate that.

---

## 2) Variable names: mostly fine, but one key mismatch in what is being compared (b vs β)

### The table reports standardized coefficients (β), but your “full” models report unstandardized b and also β
- Your `model*_full` outputs include both **b** and **beta**.
- Your `model*_table1` uses the **beta** column (good in principle), but the **values do not match** the True β’s.

**Fix:**
- Keep using standardized coefficients for the Table 1 comparison, but make sure:
  1. You standardize the same variables the same way as the authors.
  2. You did not standardize binary indicators incorrectly (papers usually still report standardized betas for dummies, but depending on software/settings, results can differ if you standardize outcomes only vs all variables).
  3. You are using the same weighting scheme (GSS analyses often use weights; standardized betas can differ under weighting).

---

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model (every mismatch)

Below I compare **Generated Table1 β** vs **True β** (since Table 1 is β’s).

### Model 1 (SES): all β’s and constant are off
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close but not exact |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | too large |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | too low |

**Fix:**
- Once you fix the analytic sample (N=787) and variable constructions, these should move toward the true values.
- Also check whether the dependent variable is identically coded (a shift in constant strongly suggests outcome scale/coding or sample differences).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic): multiple β’s differ, and several have wrong sign
| Term | Generated β | True β | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.265*** | **-0.246*** | too negative |
| Income pc | **-0.056** | **-0.054** | close |
| Prestige | **-0.012** | **-0.006** | too negative |
| Female | **-0.087*** | **-0.083*** | close (star threshold differs; see §5) |
| Age | **0.104*** | **0.140*** | substantially smaller |
| Black | **0.013** | **0.029** | too small |
| Hispanic | **0.036** | **-0.029** | **wrong sign** |
| Other race | **-0.027** | **0.005** | **wrong sign** |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.081** | **0.059** | too large |
| No religion | **-0.020** | **-0.012** | too negative |
| Southern | **0.063** | **0.097** | too small |
| Constant | **9.645** | **8.507** | far too high |

**Fix (targeted):**
1. **Race/ethnicity construction is very likely wrong.**  
   Your missingness shows `hispanic` has ~35% missing, which is unusual if “Hispanic” is derived from a race/ethnicity composite. The paper likely uses a cleaner mutually exclusive scheme. Rebuild:
   - `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` from the same base race/ethnicity variables used in the paper, ensuring reference category matches (typically White non-Hispanic).
2. **Southern**: check definition (Census region vs “born in South” vs “currently lives in South”). Wrong operationalization changes β and significance.
3. **Constant**: large discrepancy suggests the dependent variable mean differs (coding) or the sample differs (most likely due to your N problem).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): several mismatches; key variable differs
| Term | Generated β | True β | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.154*** | **-0.151** | close (star differs) |
| Income pc | **-0.058** | **-0.009** | **way too negative** |
| Prestige | **-0.017** | **-0.022** | somewhat off |
| Female | **-0.123*** | **-0.095*** | too negative |
| Age | **0.092** | **0.110*** | too small and wrong significance |
| Black | **0.045** | **0.049** | close |
| Hispanic | **0.059** | **0.031** | too large |
| Other race | **0.050** | **0.053** | close |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.032** | **0.066** | too small |
| No religion | **0.017** | **0.024** | too small |
| Southern | **0.073** | **0.121** | too small |
| Political intolerance | **0.183** | **0.164** | too large |
| Constant | **7.590** | **6.516** | too high |

**Fix (targeted):**
- Your **income β** being -0.058 vs -0.009 is a red flag: either you used a different income variable, scaled it differently, or changed the sample composition drastically (and your N=286 confirms the latter).
- Reconstruct **political intolerance** to reduce missingness and match N=503; this will likely move coefficients (and R²) toward the table values.

---

## 4) Standard errors: your output implies SE/p-values exist, but Table 1 does not report SE

- **Generated** reports p-values and stars based on them.
- **True/Table 1** explicitly says **SE are not reported** (only β and stars).

This is not a “numerical mismatch” per se, but it creates **interpretation mismatches** because your stars come from *your* p-values, not necessarily the paper’s.

**Fix options:**
1. **If the goal is to match Table 1 exactly:** do not display SE/p from your re-estimation; display only β and stars as in the table.
2. **If you must show p-values:** then you need to replicate the paper’s exact estimation choices (weights, robust SE, design effects, etc.) so significance aligns.

---

## 5) Significance stars: multiple mismatches (likely due to different SE method/sample)

Examples:
- **Model 2 Age**
  - Generated: Age is `0.104*` (p≈0.019)
  - True: Age is `0.140***`
- **Model 2 Southern**
  - Generated: Southern not significant (0.063)
  - True: Southern `0.097**`
- **Model 3 Political intolerance**
  - Generated: `0.183**` (p≈0.0039)
  - True: `0.164***`

**Fix:**
- Use the same:
  1. **Sample** (biggest driver here)
  2. **Weights** (GSS weight variable if used)
  3. **SE estimator** (OLS vs robust vs design-based). GSS often requires accounting for survey design if the authors did; otherwise stars will differ.

---

## 6) Interpretation mismatches (what your generated results would imply vs the table)

Because several coefficients have **wrong sign** (Model 2 Hispanic, Other race) and many magnitudes differ, any narrative interpretation that:
- Hispanics dislike more genres (generated positive β) would contradict the table (true negative β in Model 2).
- “Southern is weak/non-significant” (generated) contradicts the table (true Southern is **positive and significant** in Models 2 and 3).

**Fix:**
- Do not interpret until the replication matches on:
  - variable coding (especially race/ethnicity and South),
  - the analytic N per model,
  - the intolerance scale construction.

---

## 7) Concrete checklist to make Generated match True

1. **Rebuild the analytic sample to hit Table 1 N’s**: 787 / 756 / 503  
   - Confirm GSS 1993 filter and any additional restrictions used by the paper.
2. **Recode the dependent variable** exactly as “number of genres disliked” in the paper.
3. **Reconstruct race/ethnicity dummies** using a low-missing source and matching the paper’s reference category.
4. **Reconstruct “Southern”** using the same concept (region vs birthplace).
5. **Reconstruct political intolerance** to match item content, scaling, and missing-data handling so N≈503.
6. **Apply weights / SE method** consistent with the paper (if used).
7. **Report standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and unstandardized constant, matching Table 1’s reporting convention.

If you share the code (or at least the exact variable names and recode steps you used for: `num_genres_disliked`, `hispanic/black/otherrace`, `south`, and `pol_intol`), I can pinpoint which construction step is causing the sign flips and the massive N loss in Models 2–3.
