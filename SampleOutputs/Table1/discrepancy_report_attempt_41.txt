Score: 43/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics and sample sizes (major mismatches)

**Mismatch: R² / adjusted R² are too low in all generated models**
- **Model 1:** generated R² **0.088** (adj 0.085) vs true **0.107** (adj 0.104)
- **Model 2:** generated R² **0.126** (adj 0.113) vs true **0.151** (adj 0.139)
- **Model 3:** generated R² **0.135** (adj 0.112) vs true **0.169** (adj 0.148)

**Mismatch: N is smaller in generated models**
- **Model 1:** generated **747** vs true **787** (−40)
- **Model 2:** generated **745** vs true **756** (−11)
- **Model 3:** generated **421** vs true **503** (−82)

**Likely causes**
- Different missing-data handling than the paper (e.g., listwise deletion applied differently; extra exclusions due to recodes).
- Variable construction not matching the paper (esp. political intolerance and race dummies).
- Possibly using weights vs not, or different year/sample.

**How to fix**
1. **Reproduce the paper’s exact analytic sample rules**:
   - Confirm you are using **GSS 1993** only.
   - Use the same **age range** / eligibility restrictions as the paper (if any).
2. **Match missing-data treatment**:
   - The paper’s N implies less case loss than your pipeline—your code is dropping too many cases, especially in Model 3.
   - Ensure you’re not accidentally setting valid codes to missing (common in GSS due to DK/NA codes).
3. **Confirm consistent listwise deletion per model**:
   - Model 1 should be listwise on (DV, educ, inc_pc, prestige) only.
   - Model 2 adds demographics.
   - Model 3 adds political intolerance.
4. **Check weighting**:
   - If the paper uses a weight and you do not (or vice versa), coefficients/SEs/R² can shift. Even if Table 1 doesn’t mention it, verify.

### 2) Variable name / coding / inclusion problems

#### A. “Other race” is broken in generated Model 3
**Mismatch**
- Generated model3 shows:
  - `Other race` has **b ≈ 6.4e-17, beta = NaN, p = NaN**
  - fit_stats says “dropped otherrace”
- True Model 3 includes **Other race β = 0.053** (not dropped)

**Interpretation**
- In your Model 3 sample, `otherrace` is **perfectly collinear** or has **no variation** (e.g., all 0s after subsetting to those with political intolerance).
- This is a *coding/subsetting* error, not a substantive result.

**How to fix**
- Ensure race dummies are created correctly **before** subsetting and that categories aren’t inadvertently collapsed.
- Check frequencies **within the Model 3 analytic sample**:
  - `table(otherrace, complete.cases(model3_vars))`
- Use a single consistent race reference category (likely “White”) and include dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race.
- If you accidentally created race from a variable that becomes missing when pol_intol is present, recode race from the original race/ethnicity variables independent of political intolerance items.

### 3) Coefficients (standardized β) mismatches by model

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (with stars). Your “table1style” outputs appear to be β (good), but many values do not match.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | ❌ |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | ~ close (tiny diff) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | ❌ small diff |
| Constant (unstd) | **10.638** | **10.920** | ❌ |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | ❌ |
| N | **747** | **787** | ❌ |

**Fix**
- Primary issue is **sample mismatch** (N and R² off), which will shift β and constant. Fix sample selection/recoding first; coefficients likely move into place.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.229*** | **-0.246*** | ❌ |
| Income pc | **-0.055** | **-0.054** | ~ close |
| Prestige | **0.005** | **-0.006** | ❌ sign mismatch |
| Female | **-0.085***? (generated shows -0.085*) | **-0.083***? (true -0.083*) | close |
| Age | **0.126*** | **0.140*** | ❌ |
| Black | **0.017** | **0.029** | ❌ |
| Hispanic | **0.055** | **-0.029** | ❌ sign mismatch (big) |
| Other race | **0.022** | **0.005** | ❌ |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.101** **(sig)** | **0.059 (ns)** | ❌ magnitude + significance mismatch |
| No religion | **0.000** | **-0.012** | ❌ |
| Southern | **0.070 (p≈.053)** | **0.097** ** | ❌ size + significance mismatch |
| Constant | **8.139** | **8.507** | ❌ |
| R² | **0.126** | **0.151** | ❌ |
| N | **745** | **756** | ❌ |

**Fixes (beyond sample)**
- **Prestige sign flip**: strongly suggests a **coding direction problem** (e.g., prestige reversed, or using a different prestige measure/year like `prestg80` vs another index, or scaling/standardization error).
- **Hispanic sign flip**: suggests you may have coded Hispanic dummy incorrectly (e.g., reference category wrong; mixing race and ethnicity; coding 1 for non-Hispanic by mistake).
- **Conservative Protestant too large and significant**: could be:
  - Mis-specified religion coding (e.g., coding “any Protestant” as conservative Protestant)
  - Wrong omitted category
  - Sample restriction creating compositional shift
- **Southern effect weaker and loses significance**: could be region coding mismatch (South definition differs) or sample mismatch.

Concrete checks:
1. Verify dummy coding:
   - `female`: 1=female, 0=male
   - `black/hispanic/otherrace`: mutually exclusive, reference=white non-Hispanic (or whatever the paper uses—must match).
2. Verify `cons_prot` and `norelig` definitions match paper (denominational classification).
3. Confirm `south` uses Census South vs “born in South” vs “lives in South”.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.146***? (generated -0.146*) | **-0.151** ** | close-ish but stars differ |
| Income pc | **-0.015** | **-0.009** | ❌ |
| Prestige | **-0.001** | **-0.022** | ❌ big |
| Female | **-0.099***? (-0.099*) | **-0.095* ** | close |
| Age | **0.054 (ns)** | **0.110* ** | ❌ big |
| Black | **0.074** | **0.049** | ❌ |
| Hispanic | **0.091 (p≈.073)** | **0.031** | ❌ |
| Other race | **dropped/blank** | **0.053** | ❌ |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.096 (p≈.058)** | **0.066** | ❌ |
| No religion | **0.029** | **0.024** | close |
| Southern | **0.070** | **0.121** ** | ❌ |
| Political intolerance | **0.179*** | **0.164*** | ❌ |
| Constant | **6.590** | **6.516** | close-ish |
| R² | **0.135** | **0.169** | ❌ |
| N | **421** | **503** | ❌ |

**Fix**
- Again, sample mismatch is severe in Model 3 (−82 cases).
- Age effect being roughly half of true (0.054 vs 0.110) strongly suggests you are not matching the paper’s political intolerance construction or sample; adding pol_intol should not eliminate age that dramatically unless the sample composition changes a lot.
- Fix the pol_intol variable construction and missingness coding first (see next section).

### 4) Standard errors: generated vs true (interpretation mismatch)

**Mismatch**
- Your generated tables include **p-values and significance** from standard errors, but the “True Results” explicitly say:
  - **Table 1 does not report SEs**, only β and stars.
- So you cannot legitimately compare your SE/p-based stars to the paper’s stars unless you reproduce the same estimation details (weights, robust SEs, clustering, etc.)—and even then, the paper’s stars could be based on different SE assumptions.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to match Table 1 exactly:
  1. Output **only standardized β and the same stars as the paper** (i.e., carry stars from the paper, not from your computed p-values), **or**
  2. Recompute stars under the paper’s exact inference method (needs: whether weighted, robust, design-based SEs, etc.).
- Practically: for “matching” you should compare **β and constants and R² and N**, not SEs (since “true” SEs aren’t provided).

---

### 5) Interpretation/labeling inconsistencies

**Mismatch: term labels**
- Generated uses “Education (years)” while true uses “Education”. That’s minor, but it can indicate a deeper mismatch: paper might use education in years vs degree categories. If the paper used a different education measure, β will differ.

**How to fix**
- Verify education variable construction:
  - Is it **years of schooling** (0–20) or **highest degree** recoded?
  - Match the paper exactly.

---

### 6) Missingness diagnostics point to a key problem

Your missingness table shows:
- `pol_intol` missing **47.1%**
- DV `num_genres_disliked` missing **44.4%**

That is extremely high and explains the huge N drop. It may still be correct (if many people weren’t asked the module), but it must align with the paper’s N.

**Critical inconsistency**
- If DV nonmissing is **893**, you cannot get Model 1 N **787** unless other predictors reduce it somewhat. You got **747**, which suggests extra missingness introduced by your recodes (income? education? prestige?) or more stringent filtering.

**How to fix**
- Confirm your DV is constructed exactly like the paper’s “Number of music genres disliked” and not:
  - using too many genre items (increasing missingness),
  - requiring complete responses to *all* genre items when paper allowed partial and computed a count differently,
  - or applying “don’t know” recodes too aggressively.

## Priority order to make the generated analysis match the true Table 1

1. **Rebuild the dependent variable exactly as the paper did** (biggest driver of N and R²).
2. **Recode GSS missing values correctly** (DK/NA/INAP) for every variable; avoid turning valid categories into NA.
3. **Recreate race/ethnicity dummies to match the paper** (fix Hispanic sign and “Other race dropped”).
4. **Verify prestige measure and direction** (fix prestige sign flip in Model 2 and weak effect in Model 3).
5. **Verify religion variables (cons_prot, norelig) and South definition**.
6. **Re-run models with the same case selection per model** and then compare β, constant, R², and N to Table 1.

If you share the code (or at least the exact variable sources/recodes for DV, pol_intol, race/ethnicity, cons_prot), I can pinpoint the exact coding discrepancy responsible for each mismatch (e.g., which dummy is inverted, which GSS missing codes are mishandled, and why otherrace collapses in Model 3).
