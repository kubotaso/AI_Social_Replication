Score: 42/100
============================================================

Below is a term-by-term comparison of the **Generated Results** vs the **True Results (Table 1 from the PDF)**, covering **variable names, coefficients, (non‑)standard errors, fit stats, sample sizes, and interpretation/significance**—plus what to change so the generated analysis matches the published table.

---

## 1) Core mismatch: you’re not reproducing the same estimation sample (biggest problem)

### What Table 1 says (True)
- **N**: Model 1 = **787**, Model 2 = **756**, Model 3 = **503**

### What you generated
- **N**: Model 1 = **758**, Model 2 = **523**, Model 3 = **293**

These are not small deviations; they imply different missing-data rules, different variable construction, or even a different subset (e.g., year filter, DV construction, listwise deletion done differently, or weights).

### How to fix
To match Table 1, you must replicate **exactly**:
1. **Same survey wave/year selection** used in the paper (your diagnostics show “N_year_1993 = 1606”, but Table 1’s N’s are not “all 1993 respondents” either—there are additional inclusion rules).
2. **Same DV construction** (“number of music genres disliked”) and **the same requirement for valid items** (e.g., requiring valid responses on all genre items vs allowing partial and summing nonmissing).
3. **Same missing-data handling** (Table 1 is almost certainly *listwise deletion within each model*, but with *different underlying missingness than you have*—especially for Hispanic and political intolerance).
4. **Same coding/recoding** of predictors (race/ethnicity, religion tradition, etc.) and how missing codes are treated (e.g., GSS-style 8/9/98/99/0/97 etc.).

A tell: your `political_intolerance` has only **491 nonmissing out of 893 DV-complete**, leaving **293** after listwise deletion with all covariates. Table 1 still has **503** in Model 3—meaning their political intolerance measure has **far fewer missings**, or they computed it differently (e.g., using fewer items, allowing partial scales, or recoding “don’t know” differently).

---

## 2) Variable-name mismatches (labeling vs construct)

### Names in your generated output
- `income_pc`
- `prestg80`
- `conservative_protestant`
- `no_religion`
- `political_intolerance`
- `other_race`

### Names in Table 1 (True)
- “Household income per capita”
- “Occupational prestige”
- “Conservative Protestant”
- “No religion”
- “Political intolerance”
- “Other race”

These are mostly *label differences* **except** you have evidence that **Hispanic is derived from ETHNIC==1** and your `political_intolerance` looks like a multi-item sum with values up to at least 11.

### How to fix
- Ensure that each variable is not only renamed but **constructed identically** to the paper.
- Specifically verify:
  - **Income per capita**: is it *household income / household size*? Are you using the same income measure (e.g., constant dollars? midpoints? logged?) The big N-drop in your models can happen if you used a stricter income availability requirement than the authors.
  - **Occupational prestige**: `prestg80` is plausible, but check whether the paper used a different prestige score (or imputed/assigned values for nonworkers).
  - **Hispanic**: Table 1 has N=756 in Model 2; your Hispanic variable has huge missingness (612 nonmissing, 281 missing). That is a *construct mismatch*: in GSS, Hispanic origin is often available more broadly than your ETHNIC-derived approach, or it may be coded differently with fewer missings if derived from a different source variable.
  - **Political intolerance**: your missingness is extreme (402 missing among DV complete). That almost certainly does **not** match the paper’s scale construction.

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (every term)

All coefficients below are **standardized betas** (Table 1 prints standardized betas only). Your generated betas differ widely.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.332*** | **-0.322*** | off by -0.010 |
| Income per capita | **-0.034** | **-0.037** | off by +0.003 (and your star display differs: you show no star; true also no star, so ok) |
| Occupational prestige | **0.029** | **0.016** | off by +0.013 |
| Constant | **11.086** | **10.920** | off by +0.166 |
| R² | **0.109** | **0.107** | off by +0.002 |
| Adj R² | **0.105** | **0.104** | off by +0.001 |
| N | **758** | **787** | off by -29 |

**Fix**: sample/variable construction differences. Even small coefficient differences can come from different listwise sample or different standardization convention (see section 6).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.302*** | **-0.246*** | large (too negative) |
| Income per capita | **-0.057** | **-0.054** | close |
| Occupational prestige | **-0.007** | **-0.006** | close |
| Female | **-0.078** (p=.061) | **-0.083\*** | sign same; you miss the * and magnitude differs |
| Age | **0.109\*** | **0.140\***\*\* | too small and wrong significance level |
| Black | **0.053** | **0.029** | too large |
| Hispanic | **-0.017** | **-0.029** | too small (less negative) |
| Other race | **-0.016** | **0.005** | wrong sign |
| Conservative Protestant | **0.040** | **0.059** | too small |
| No religion | **-0.016** | **-0.012** | close |
| Southern | **0.079** (p=.061) | **0.097\*\*** | too small and wrong significance |
| Constant | **10.089** | **8.507** | very different |
| R² | **0.157** | **0.151** | slightly high |
| Adj R² | **0.139** | **0.139** | matches |
| N | **523** | **756** | **massive** mismatch |

**Fix**: This model clearly isn’t the same dataset/definitions. The **constant** difference is particularly suggestive that either:
- DV is not coded identically, or
- you standardized differently but printed the *raw* constant from a different specification, or
- you’re using a different estimation subsample (most likely), which changes the raw mean of DV and thus the intercept.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.157\*** | **-0.151\*\*** | close magnitude but different star level |
| Income per capita | **-0.067** | **-0.009** | very different |
| Occupational prestige | **-0.008** | **-0.022** | differs |
| Female | **-0.118\*** | **-0.095\*** | too negative |
| Age | **0.092** | **0.110\*** | too small and missing star |
| Black | **0.004** | **0.049** | very different |
| Hispanic | **0.091** | **0.031** | too large |
| Other race | **0.053** | **0.053** | matches exactly (likely coincidence) |
| Conservative Protestant | **-0.011** | **0.066** | wrong sign |
| No religion | **0.018** | **0.024** | close |
| Southern | **0.073** | **0.121\*\*** | too small, missing ** |
| Political intolerance | **0.196\*\*** | **0.164\*\*\*** | too large and wrong star level |
| Constant | **7.583** | **6.516** | off by +1.067 |
| R² | **0.152** | **0.169** | too low |
| Adj R² | **0.115** | **0.148** | too low |
| N | **293** | **503** | huge mismatch |

**Fix**: again, you’re not reproducing the published intolerance scale and/or not using their missing-data rules. Also your `conservative_protestant` is likely miscoded (see next section).

---

## 4) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Your stars are based on **your p-values**, but Table 1’s stars reflect **their p-values**, which differ because coefficients and SEs differ (different N/sample, different coding, possibly weights).

Concrete star mismatches:
- **Model 2**: Female should be `*` but you have none (p=.061).
- **Model 2**: Age should be `***` but you have `*`.
- **Model 2**: Southern should be `**` but you have none (p=.061).
- **Model 3**: Education should be `**` but you have `*`.
- **Model 3**: Age should be `*` but you have none.
- **Model 3**: Southern should be `**` but you have none.
- **Model 3**: Political intolerance should be `***` but you have `**`.

**Fix**: once you replicate the exact sample + variable construction + estimation method, stars will align. Don’t “force” stars; fix the underlying model.

---

## 5) Standard errors: your output prints none, but you implicitly treat second line as SEs

In your `table1_style`, each coefficient is followed by a second line (e.g., for educ: `-0.332***` then `-0.034`). Those second-line numbers **are not standard errors** (they don’t correspond to anything sensible as SEs, and they match other coefficients in your coefficient list). Meanwhile, the True Results explicitly state:

- **Table 1 does not print standard errors**.

### How to fix
- Remove the second line entirely if you want to match Table 1 formatting.
- If you want an internal check with SEs, output them in a separate table, but do not claim they’re “as printed”.
- Ensure your “table1_style” renderer isn’t accidentally printing the next coefficient as if it were an SE due to a formatting bug (common when stacking arrays without row labels).

---

## 6) Standardization convention mismatch (likely contributing)

Table 1 reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. You report `beta_std`. But there are multiple ways to standardize:

1. **Standardize X and Y first, then run OLS** (gives standardized slope; intercept ~0).
2. **Compute beta = b * sd(X)/sd(Y)** from an unstandardized regression.
3. Use **sample-weighted** standard deviations vs unweighted.
4. Standardize using the **model estimation sample** vs full sample.

Your tables show a nonzero intercept (“Constant 11.086”, etc.), suggesting you ran **unstandardized Y** and then computed standardized betas post hoc. That can still match Table 1, but only if done exactly like the authors.

### How to fix
- Determine which standardization method the paper used. Most published “standardized coefficients” in sociology come from method (2) on the **model’s estimation sample**, often **without weights** unless stated.
- Recompute standardized betas using the same method and sample as the paper.

---

## 7) Specific variable construction red flags (likely causes of wrong signs/magnitudes)

### A) `conservative_protestant` sign flips in Model 3
- Generated: **-0.011**
- True: **+0.066**

This is not a minor discrepancy; it suggests:
- wrong reference category (e.g., coding Conservative Protestant vs mainline vs Catholic),
- reversed dummy (1 = not conservative protestant),
- or you conditioned on a different religion universe.

**Fix**: Rebuild religion tradition dummies exactly as authors:
- Identify their base category (often “other Protestant/Catholic/other religion”).
- Ensure `conservative_protestant=1` only for that tradition; all others 0; missing handled correctly.

### B) Hispanic missingness is huge in your data
Your diagnostics: `hispanic nonmissing = 612, missing = 281` among DV complete.

That’s inconsistent with Table 1 N=756 in Model 2 (which includes Hispanic). If Hispanic were missing for 281 cases, you could not get N=756 unless DV complete were much larger and other missings were tiny—which doesn’t match your DV complete (893).

**Fix**: Use the same Hispanic origin variable and treat missing codes the same way the authors did. Your ETHNIC-derived method is likely not what they used, or you’re inadvertently treating many substantive codes as missing.

### C) Political intolerance scale missingness is far too high
Your `political_intolerance` has 402 missing among DV-complete. Table 1 retains 503 cases in Model 3; you retain only 293.

**Fix**: Reconstruct political intolerance per paper:
- Same items
- Same coding of each item (including “don’t know/refused”)
- Same rule for scale creation (e.g., allow up to k missing items and average; or use fewer items; or impute)
- Confirm scale range matches theirs

---

## 8) Fit statistics mismatches

- Model 2: **R² 0.157 vs 0.151** (close, but given N mismatch, it’s not “agreement”)
- Model 3: **R² 0.152 vs 0.169** (meaningful difference)
- Constants differ substantially in Models 2–3.

**Fix**: once sample and variable construction are corrected, refit OLS and confirm R²/Adj R² and intercepts align with printed values.

---

## 9) What to change in your generated “analysis” text/interpretation

Even if you correct the numbers, ensure your narrative matches the table’s substantive claims:

- Education is **negative and strongest** predictor across models (true: -0.322, -0.246, -0.151).
- Income per capita becomes **near zero** in Model 3 in the true table (-0.009), but in yours it becomes strongly negative (-0.067). Any narrative about income remaining important would be wrong.
- Political intolerance is **positive and significant** (true: 0.164***). Yours is positive but with weaker significance (**), so your discussion of strength/significance must match once corrected.
- Southern is **positive and significant** in true Models 2–3 (0.097**, 0.121**). In yours it’s weaker and not significant—your regional interpretation would be wrong.

---

## 10) Minimal checklist to make the generated results match Table 1

1. **Recreate DV exactly** (number of genres disliked) with same missing rules.
2. **Recreate each predictor exactly** (especially Hispanic, religion tradition, political intolerance).
3. **Apply the same sample restrictions** (year, age eligibility, valid-response rules).
4. **Use the same missing-data approach** (likely listwise per model, but only after correct recodes).
5. **Use same standardization method** (and weights, if any).
6. **Fix table rendering** so it prints only standardized betas (no SE lines) because the true table has **no SEs**.
7. Re-run and confirm exact match on:
   - N, R², Adj R², constant
   - all standardized betas
   - star thresholds

---

If you share (a) the code that creates `hispanic`, `conservative_protestant`, and `political_intolerance`, and (b) how you build `num_genres_disliked`, I can pinpoint exactly which recode or missing rule is producing the N collapses and sign flips, and specify the exact corrections.
