============================================================

Below is a variable-by-variable and model-by-model comparison of **Generated** vs **True (Table 1)**, flagging *every* mismatch in (a) variable names/inclusion, (b) standardized coefficients, (c) standard errors/reporting, and (d) interpretation/fit statistics. I also explain exactly how to fix each issue so the generated analysis matches the printed table.

---

## 1) Global reporting/replication problems

### A. Standard errors are shown, but the “true” table has none
- **Mismatch:** Your generated table prints a second line under each coefficient that appears to be **standard errors** (e.g., educ in Model 1: “-0.332***” then “-0.034”).  
  The **True Results explicitly state Table 1 prints standardized coefficients only and does not print SEs**.
- **Fix options (choose one):**
  1) **Remove SE lines entirely** from `table1_style` to match Table 1 exactly; or  
  2) If you must show SEs, **label them clearly as computed SEs not from Table 1**, and do not claim they match the PDF.

### B. Sample sizes (N) do not match in Models 1 and 3
- **Mismatch:**
  - Model 1: **Generated N=758** vs **True N=787**
  - Model 2: **Generated N=756** vs **True N=756** (matches)
  - Model 3: **Generated N=426** vs **True N=503**
- **Likely causes:**
  - Overly strict **listwise deletion** (especially for the political intolerance index).
  - Different missing-data handling than the original authors (e.g., they may allow partial item nonresponse when constructing political intolerance, or they may impute/recoded missing on covariates differently).
  - Possible differences in who is included (e.g., restricting to 1993 is fine—your diagnostic says N_year_1993=1606—so the loss is from additional filters/missingness).
- **Fix:** Recreate the authors’ **exact inclusion rules**:
  - For Model 1: identify which variables in SES model are causing extra case loss vs the paper. You need **+29 cases** (787–758).
  - For Model 3: you need **+77 cases** (503–426). This is consistent with your own note: *“Political intolerance is strict complete-case sum across 15 items”*—the paper likely **did not require all 15 items to be answered**.
  - Concretely: construct political intolerance using the paper’s rule (common options):
    - require a minimum number of answered items (e.g., ≥10 of 15) and scale up, or
    - mean of non-missing items, or
    - treat certain nonresponses as 0/“tolerant” depending on item coding (less likely, but possible).
  - Until you match N, you will not match coefficients/R² either.

### C. R² and Adjusted R² do not match (Models 2 and 3 especially)
- **Mismatch:**
  - Model 1: Generated R²=0.1088 vs True R²=0.107 (close but not exact)
  - Model 2: Generated R²=0.1452 vs True R²=0.151 (off)
  - Model 3: Generated R²=0.1394 vs True R²=0.169 (substantially off)
- **Fix:** R² discrepancies will typically resolve once you:
  1) match the **sample (N)**, and
  2) match **variable construction** (especially political intolerance and Hispanic), and
  3) match any **weighting** (if the original used survey weights and you did not, coefficients/R² can shift). If the PDF used weights, you must apply them.

### D. Constants do not match in any model
- **Mismatch (Constant):**
  - Model 1: Generated 11.086 vs True 10.920
  - Model 2: Generated 8.788 vs True 8.507
  - Model 3: Generated 7.355 vs True 6.516
- **Fix:** Constants will change with any of:
  - different **sample**,
  - different **coding of predictors**,
  - whether the DV or predictors are standardized, and
  - weighting.
  
  **Important:** If Table 1 reports *standardized coefficients*, the intercept is usually from the **unstandardized DV model** (as in your “true” table). Ensure you are estimating **unstandardized y with unstandardized X**, then separately computing standardized betas (or use a procedure that outputs standardized betas while keeping intercept on original scale). But the big constant differences strongly suggest **sample/variable coding mismatch**.

## 2) Variable inclusion/name mismatches

### A. Hispanic is missing from the generated models
- **Mismatch:** The true Table 1 includes **Hispanic** in Models 2 and 3. Generated outputs include **black** and **other_race** but **no Hispanic** term. Your diagnostics even state: *“Hispanic not modeled…”*
- **Fix:** You must create a Hispanic indicator consistent with the dataset/codebook used by the authors.
  - If your extract truly lacks ethnicity, you cannot replicate Table 1 exactly. You would need:
    - the correct ethnicity variable from the source (e.g., `hispanic`, `ethnic`, `latino`, or a constructed ethnicity from multiple fields), **or**
    - the same race/ethnicity recode the authors used (often: mutually exclusive categories such as White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic any race, Other).
  - Once included, coefficients on race categories and sometimes Southern/education will shift.

### B. Variable naming differs (minor but should be aligned)
- **Mismatch (names):**
  - True: “Household income per capita” vs Generated: `income_pc` (fine internally, but table label should match)
  - True: “Occupational prestige” vs Generated: `prestg80` (again, fine internally; table label should match)
  - True: “Political intolerance” vs Generated: `political_intolerance` (fine, but label should match)
- **Fix:** Relabel variables in the printed table to match Table 1 wording exactly.

## 3) Standardized coefficient mismatches (every coefficient)

Below I list **Generated beta_std vs True standardized coefficient**, by model.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.332 | -0.322 | yes (more negative in generated) |
| Income pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | yes |
| Occ prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | yes (generated about double) |

**Fix:** This will not be exact until you match **N=787** and the exact variable coding/standardization method used by the authors. Your method (“z-scored y and z-scored X within each model estimation sample”) is reasonable, but still must be done on the **same sample** and with the **same coding**.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.259 | -0.246 | yes |
| Income pc | -0.050 | -0.054 | yes |
| Occ prestige | 0.006 | -0.006 | yes (sign differs) |
| Female | -0.089 | -0.083 | yes |
| Age | 0.129 | 0.140 | yes |
| Black | 0.030 | 0.029 | tiny mismatch |
| Hispanic | — | -0.029 | **missing term** |
| Other race | 0.001 | 0.005 | yes |
| Cons Protestant | 0.067 | 0.059 | yes |
| No religion | -0.004 | -0.012 | yes |
| Southern | 0.084 | 0.097 | yes |

**Fix priorities (in order):**
1) **Add Hispanic** with correct coding (this can change other race coefficients too, depending on reference category).
2) Ensure your **race/ethnicity reference category** matches the paper. The paper likely uses White (non-Hispanic) as reference, with Black/Hispanic/Other indicators.
3) Check **age coding** (years vs categories, top-coding) and **female coding** (0/1).
4) Confirm **income per capita** is constructed the same way (household income / household size? equivalized? inflation adjustment?).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.161 | -0.151 | yes |
| Income pc | -0.012 | -0.009 | yes |
| Occ prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | yes |
| Female | -0.114 | -0.095 | yes |
| Age | 0.060 | 0.110 | yes (big) |
| Black | 0.062 | 0.049 | yes |
| Hispanic | — | 0.031 | **missing term** |
| Other race | 0.051 | 0.053 | close mismatch |
| Cons Protestant | 0.053 | 0.066 | yes |
| No religion | 0.020 | 0.024 | yes |
| Southern | 0.087 | 0.121 | yes (big) |
| Political intolerance | 0.166 | 0.164 | close, but sig differs (see below) |

**Fix priorities:**
1) **Fix N=503** by matching the authors’ political intolerance construction and missing-data rule (this is likely the main driver of the big differences in age/southern/R²).
2) **Add Hispanic**.
3) Verify the **political intolerance scale** direction and range. You used a 0–15 “sum across 15 items.” The paper’s coefficient is close, but your stricter complete-case rule is probably altering the estimation sample.

---

## 4) Significance-star mismatches

Even when coefficients are close, stars differ in several places.

### Political intolerance significance
- **Mismatch:** Generated: `0.166**` (p≈0.00147) vs True: `0.164***`
- **Fix:** This is almost certainly due to different **N (426 vs 503)** and possibly different SE estimation (weights/robust SE). After matching sample and estimation method, the p-value should line up better.

### Southern and Female in Model 2
- **Mismatch:** Generated: southern `0.084*` vs True: `0.097**`; female `-0.089**` vs True `-0.083*`
- **Fix:** Again points to differences in SEs/p-values caused by sample/composition and possibly weighting/robustness. Match the model spec exactly first.

### Age in Model 3
- **Mismatch:** Generated age not significant (no star) vs True `0.110*`
- **Fix:** Likely sample/scale construction mismatch (political intolerance listwise deletion) is altering both coefficient and SE.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches (implicit)

### A. Claiming “standardized betas” is fine, but you must match the paper’s standardization
- **Mismatch risk:** There are multiple ways to get “standardized coefficients”:
  1) standardize **X only** (y in original units),
  2) standardize **both X and y**,
  3) post-hoc compute beta = b * (sdX/sdY).
  
  Your note says you z-scored y and X within each model sample. That yields standardized coefficients, but the paper may have used method (3). They *should* agree numerically if done correctly on the same sample, but any mismatch in sample/weights breaks equality.
- **Fix:** Use the most replicable approach: estimate unstandardized OLS on the correct sample, then compute standardized betas as  
  \[
  \beta_j = b_j \times \frac{\mathrm{SD}(X_j)}{\mathrm{SD}(Y)}
  \]
  using SDs computed on the **exact estimation sample** (and using **weighted SDs** if weights were used).

### B. Hispanic omission changes interpretation of race effects
- **Mismatch:** Without Hispanic in the model, your “black” and “other_race” coefficients are not the same estimand as in the paper (since ethnicity-related variation is absorbed elsewhere).
- **Fix:** Add Hispanic and ensure mutually exclusive categories consistent with the authors’ reference group.

---

## 6) Concrete “to-do list” to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1) **Recover/code the Hispanic variable** exactly as in the study (or obtain the missing field).  
   - Recode race/ethnicity into the same dummy structure as the paper.

2) **Rebuild the political intolerance scale** to match the authors:
   - replicate item coding (0/1?), handling of DK/NA,
   - replicate aggregation rule (sum vs mean; allowed missing items),
   - target **N=503** for Model 3.

3) **Match sample selection for Model 1** to reach **N=787**:
   - identify which of educ/income_pc/prestige is dropping cases and how the paper treated those missings.

4) **Check weighting and variance estimation**:
   - If the original analysis used survey weights, apply them.
   - If robust or design-based SEs were used, note Table 1 does not print SEs—but significance stars depend on p-values, which depend on SE method.

5) **Align table output to the PDF**:
   - Print **standardized coefficients only** (no SE lines).
   - Use the paper’s variable labels and exact model names.
   - Report **R², adjusted R², N** matching the paper.

If you share (a) the codebook/variable list for the dataset extract you used, or (b) the exact political intolerance items and their missing codes, I can pinpoint exactly where the extra 29 (Model 1) and 77 (Model 3) cases are being lost and how to reconstruct the variables to hit the published N and coefficients.
