### 1) Fit statistics (n, R², adj. R²): all three models mismatch

**Generated vs True**

- **Model 1 (SES)**
  - **n:** 757 vs **787** (true) → mismatch
  - **R²:** 0.0998 vs **0.107** → mismatch
  - **Adj R²:** 0.0963 vs **0.104** → mismatch

- **Model 2 (Demographic)**
  - **n:** 522 vs **756** → major mismatch
  - **R²:** 0.1478 vs **0.151** → mismatch (small)
  - **Adj R²:** 0.1294 vs **0.139** → mismatch

- **Model 3 (Political intolerance)**
  - **n:** 293 vs **503** → major mismatch
  - **R²:** 0.1518 vs **0.169** → mismatch
  - **Adj R²:** 0.1155 vs **0.148** → mismatch (large)

**Why this happened**
- Your generated models are being estimated on **much smaller complete-case subsets**, especially Model 2 and Model 3. The “missingness” table shows extreme missingness for:
  - `num_genres_disliked` missing 44.4%
  - `pol_intol` missing 47.1%
  - plus additional missingness in predictors
- The paper’s table clearly used substantially larger analytic Ns (787, 756, 503), meaning the generated pipeline is **not reproducing the paper’s sample restrictions/handling of missing data**.

**How to fix**
1. **Replicate the paper’s sample definition exactly** (GSS 1993 + the paper’s inclusion rules). Do not rely on whatever rows happen to be complete in your working file.
2. Ensure the dependent variable is constructed exactly as in the paper (see §5 below), since your DV has 44% missing which is unusually high and likely indicates a construction or merge problem.
3. Match the paper’s missing-data approach. If they used listwise deletion, you must still start from the same eligible subsample and the same variable coding so that listwise deletion yields the same n’s. If they used imputation or special missing codes, replicate that.

### 2) Coefficients: many mismatches (especially Model 2/3), and some are the wrong type

#### Critical issue: you are mixing **standardized β** and **unstandardized b**
- **True Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)** and **does not report SEs**.
- Your `table1` appears to present **β-like values**, but your “full” model outputs include both `b` and `beta`. Some comparisons below show your `table1` values align with `beta`, not `b`—that’s good—but several still don’t match the true β’s.

**How to fix**
- When reproducing Table 1, output **only standardized betas (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constant**, and omit SEs.
- Ensure you standardize exactly as the paper did (typically: standardize all variables except dummy variables? or include them? papers vary). If your standardization choices differ, β will differ.

### 3) Model 1 (SES): mismatches in β’s and constant

**True β vs Generated (table1)**

- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.316*** vs True: **-0.322*** → mismatch (small)
- **Income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.035** vs True: **-0.037** → mismatch (small)
- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **0.025** vs True: **0.016** → mismatch (noticeable)
- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.903** vs True: **10.920** → mismatch (small)

**Likely causes**
- Sample n mismatch (757 vs 787) will change all coefficients.
- Possible variable-coding differences (prestige measure, income scaling, education coding).

**Fix**
- First fix the analytic sample to **n=787**.
- Verify you are using the same variables:
  - Education: years, not degree categories.
  - Prestige: the same prestige index as the paper (your variable `prestg80_v` may or may not match their prestige metric/coding).
  - Income per capita: confirm definition (household income / household size?) and treatment of top-coding.

---

### 4) Model 2 (Demographic): many coefficient mismatches + wrong n

**True β vs Generated (table1)**

- Education: **-0.279*** vs **-0.246*** → mismatch
- Income: **-0.058** vs **-0.054** → mismatch
- Prestige: **-0.009** vs **-0.006** → mismatch
- Female: **-0.080** vs **-0.083*** → mismatch in **size** and **significance** (true has *)
- Age: **0.106***? (generated shows `0.106*`) vs **0.140*** → mismatch magnitude and stars
- Black: **0.051** vs **0.029** → mismatch
- Hispanic: **0.023** vs **-0.029** → **sign mismatch**
- Other race: **-0.028** vs **0.005** → **sign mismatch**
- Conservative Protestant: **0.077** vs **0.059** → mismatch
- No religion: **-0.011** vs **-0.012** → close
- Southern: **0.066** vs **0.097** → mismatch and likely stars differ
- Constant: **9.488** vs **8.507** → mismatch (large)

**Core problems**
- **n is wildly off:** 522 vs 756. That alone can flip signs (and does for Hispanic and Other race).
- Very likely differences in:
  - reference categories / dummy construction,
  - coding of race/ethnicity (especially Hispanic),
  - or inclusion/exclusion of “don’t know / refused / not applicable” codes.

**Fix**
1. Fix missing data/sample first to get **n=756**.
2. Rebuild categorical variables with the same baselines as the paper:
   - Race: ensure the same omitted category (typically “White, non-Hispanic”) and that “Hispanic” is not overlapping with race dummies unless the paper did so.
   - Religion: verify “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” definitions match the article.
   - Region: define “Southern” using the same census region coding.
3. After matching coding and sample, recompute standardized betas.

### 5) Model 3 (Political intolerance): large mismatches, including n, R², and multiple coefficients

**True β vs Generated (table1)**

- Education: Generated **-0.155***? vs True **-0.151** (true is **-0.151\*\***, generated shows `-0.155*`) → mismatch in stars
- Income: **-0.064** vs **-0.009** → big mismatch
- Prestige: **-0.010** vs **-0.022** → mismatch
- Female: **-0.117***? vs **-0.095*** → mismatch
- Age: **0.093** vs **0.110*** → mismatch (including stars)
- Black: **0.002** vs **0.049** → big mismatch
- Hispanic: **-0.089** vs **0.031** → **sign mismatch**
- Other race: **0.052** vs **0.053** → close
- Conservative Protestant: **0.022** vs **0.066** → mismatch
- No religion: **0.024** vs **0.024** → matches
- Southern: **0.067** vs **0.121** → big mismatch
- Political intolerance: **0.194** vs **0.164** → mismatch and stars (true is ***)
- Constant: **8.612** vs **6.516** → very large mismatch

**Core problems**
- Again, the **analytic sample is wrong** (293 vs 503).
- Your `pol_intol` variable likely doesn’t match the paper’s construction (scale, handling of missing, items included).
- Your DV (`num_genres_disliked`) also has huge missingness; if it’s misconstructed, Model 3 will be irreproducible.

**Fix**
1. Reconstruct `pol_intol` exactly per the paper (items, coding, range 0–15, handling of DK/NA).
2. Ensure DV is exactly “Number of music genres disliked” with the same set of genres and response coding as the paper.
3. Match sample to **n=503** after applying the paper’s inclusion rules.

### 6) Standard errors & inference: generated output is not comparable to “true” table

**Mismatch**
- Your generated results report **p-values and SE-based significance**, but the true table **does not report SEs** and reports **stars for β** from their model.
- Even if your stars are computed correctly, they won’t match unless:
  - same n,
  - same coding,
  - same weighting (if any),
  - same variance estimator (robust vs classical),
  - same two-tailed thresholds.

**Fix**
- For matching Table 1: **do not present SEs**; present β and stars only.
- To match stars, replicate:
  - weighting strategy (GSS often uses weights; if the paper did, you must),
  - classical OLS vs robust SE,
  - two-tailed p-value thresholds (given in the true results).

---

### 7) Variable-name mismatches (presentation and mapping)

These aren’t “wrong” statistically, but they are mismatches relative to the paper’s table labeling:

- Generated uses: `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, `female`, `age_v`, `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south`, `pol_intol`
- Table uses labels: Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Political intolerance

**Fix**
- Maintain a clear mapping and ensure the constructed variables correspond exactly to the paper’s definitions. Then label output to match the paper.

## Summary of what you must change to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Fix the analytic sample** to reproduce the paper’s Ns (787/756/503). Your current approach is effectively using a much smaller accidental complete-case subset.
2. **Rebuild the dependent variable** (`num_genres_disliked`) exactly as in the paper; current missingness (44%) strongly suggests a construction/coding problem.
3. **Rebuild `pol_intol`** exactly (items, missing rules, range 0–15).
4. **Match coding/baselines for categorical predictors**, especially race/ethnicity and religion; current sign flips (Hispanic, Other race) indicate misalignment.
5. **Report standardized coefficients (β) only** (plus unstandardized constant) and **omit SEs**, mirroring Table 1.
6. **Match weighting and SE method** (OLS vs robust; weights vs none) so significance stars reproduce.

If you paste the paper’s variable construction notes (or the codebook details you used), I can pinpoint which specific coding step is producing the Hispanic/Other race sign flips and the huge N losses.
