### 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

**Mismatch A: Hispanic is missing entirely in the generated models (Models 2 and 3).**  
- **True Table 1 includes:** *Hispanic* in Demographic and Political Intolerance models.  
  - Demographic: Hispanic = **-0.029**  
  - Political intolerance: Hispanic = **0.031**
- **Generated results:** include `other_race` but **no Hispanic term at all** in Model 2 or 3.

**How to fix**
- Add a `hispanic` indicator to Models 2 and 3 (and ensure it’s coded the same way as the paper—typically 1=Hispanic, 0=not Hispanic).
- Also ensure race dummies match the paper’s reference category (usually White non-Hispanic). A common structure is:
  - `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` with White non-Hispanic omitted as reference.

### 3) Standard errors: the generated table implies SEs exist, but the “true” table says they were not printed

**Mismatch B (reporting/interpretation):**  
- **True:** “Table 1 reports standardized coefficients only and does not print standard errors.”  
- **Generated table1_style:** visually looks like it includes a second line under each coefficient (which readers will interpret as **standard errors**), even though the `coefficients_long` object does not contain SEs and the “true” source says SEs aren’t available.

**How to fix**
- Either:
  1) **Remove SE rows entirely** from the formatted table (preferred if you must match the PDF), or  
  2) If you truly have access to the microdata and re-estimate models, then compute and print SEs—but then the table is no longer an extraction of the PDF; it’s a replication, and coefficients must match the paper’s specification/sample/weights to align.

---

### 4) Sample size / missingness discrepancies (this is likely the main reason coefficients don’t match)

**Mismatch C: N differs in Model 1 and Model 3.**
- **True N:** M1=787, M2=756, M3=503  
- **Generated N:** M1=758, M2=756, M3=426

Your own diagnostics show why your N shrinks:
- `N_complete_music_18 = 893` (DV complete in that restricted sample)
- Model 1 listwise = 758 because you listwise-delete on `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`
- Model 3 listwise = 426 because `political_intolerance` has 402 missing (491 nonmissing), then further listwise deletion drops to 426

But the paper’s Ns imply *different handling of missingness and/or different construction of variables* (or different initial sample restriction).

**How to fix**
1) **Match the paper’s analytic sample rules exactly**, including:
   - year filter (you appear to use 1993),
   - age restrictions,
   - any requirement about having rated a minimum number of genres,
   - any exclusions (e.g., missing on key demographics).
2) **Match the paper’s missing-data strategy.** Possibilities (one of these is likely true in the paper):
   - They did **not** require nonmissing `prestg80` / income the same way you did (e.g., used imputation, category “missing”, or different variable availability),
   - They computed political intolerance from multiple items and required fewer items than you required,
   - They used **pairwise** handling for the intolerance scale construction and then regression listwise,
   - They used a different subset than your “music_18 complete” filter.
3) **Reproduce Ns as a hard constraint**: do not proceed until your code yields N=787/756/503 for Models 1/2/3.

### 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Even where coefficients are similar, **the significance stars don’t match**:

- Model 2 Female: generated ** (p<.01) but true * (p<.05)
- Model 2 Southern: generated * but true **
- Model 3 Political intolerance: generated ** but true ***
- Model 3 Age and Southern: generated nonsig / marginal but true * and ** respectively

**How to fix**
- Stars differ because either:
  1) coefficients/SEs differ due to different sample/specification, or  
  2) you are computing p-values from your own regression but the paper used weights/design corrections (complex survey) or different SE estimator.
- If the paper used GSS-style survey weights and/or clustering/strata, you must replicate with:
  - weights,
  - robust or design-based SEs,
  - correct df calculations.

### 6) Likely specification mismatch: standardized betas + constant simultaneously

The “true” table reports **standardized coefficients** but also prints a **constant**. That implies they likely standardized *predictors* (and possibly not DV), or they reported standardized slopes but kept the raw intercept from the unstandardized model.

Your generated output mixes things ambiguously:
- `beta_std` is reported for terms,
- constants in `fit_stats` look like raw intercepts (const_raw),
- but if you standardized DV and IVs in estimation, intercept should be ~0.

**How to fix**
- Determine exactly what “standardized OLS coefficients” means in the paper:
  - **Common in sociology tables:** standardized slopes (beta) computed from an underlying unstandardized regression, while intercept remains from unstandardized model.
- Implementation approach:
  1) Fit the model on raw variables to get intercept and R² on the raw DV.
  2) Compute standardized betas via:  
     \[
     \beta^{std}_j = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
     \]
  3) Report those standardized betas in the table, but keep the raw constant.

If instead you literally z-scored all variables and refit, the intercept and R² may not match the printed ones.

## Summary of what you need to change so the generated analysis matches the “true” table

1) **Add the missing variable `hispanic`** to Models 2 and 3 and ensure race coding/reference category matches the paper.  
2) **Force the same analytic Ns** (787, 756, 503). This will require matching:
   - sample restrictions,
   - variable construction (especially political intolerance),
   - missing-data handling (possibly imputation or different tolerance for missing items),
   - and possibly survey weights/design.
3) **Align the definition of “standardized coefficient”** with the paper (standardize slopes via SD-ratio from an unstandardized model, keep raw intercept).  
4) **Fix the table formatting**: do not print “standard errors” (or SE-looking rows) if the true Table 1 did not include them.  
5) After (1)–(4), re-check coefficients, stars, R²/Adj R²—right now nearly every term differs in at least one model, which strongly indicates you are not reproducing the paper’s exact sample/specification.

If you share the code used to build `political_intolerance`, the exact sample filters, and whether you applied weights/robust SEs, I can pinpoint precisely which step is causing the N=503 vs 426 gap and the large Model 3 coefficient shifts (especially Age, Southern, and R²).
