Score: 26/100
============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics (R², Adj. R², N): all three models mismatch

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s. Align listwise deletion rules and variable coding. In particular, ensure you’re using the same year (GSS 1993), same outcome, and same missing-data handling. Your own missingness table suggests the outcome has **893 nonmissing**, so getting down to **747** implies additional filters/restrictions beyond the paper.
- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² 0.088**, **Adj. 0.085**
  - True: **R² 0.107**, **Adj. 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample matches (N=787) and variables are constructed identically, R² should move toward the reported values. Also confirm you’re using **OLS with the same weights (if any)** and not applying survey weights when the paper didn’t (or vice versa).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is a major discrepancy. It almost certainly indicates you accidentally introduced extra missingness (e.g., by using a stricter “complete cases across all three models” sample, or by pulling demographics from variables with large missingness, or by recoding “don’t know/refused” to NA differently than the paper). Recreate Model 2 on the Model 2 variable set only.
- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.141 / 0.122**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Again, primarily sample mismatch and/or variable construction mismatch.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Your `pol_intol` has ~47% missing, but even then your nonmissing is **850**, so N=286 suggests you’re throwing away many cases unnecessarily (likely complete-casing on variables not in the published model, or an unintended merge/subset). Ensure Model 3 uses only the listed predictors and the dependent variable.
- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.150 / 0.113**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Same: match sample, coding, and estimation settings.

## 2) Coefficients: mismatches in what is being reported (β vs b) and in many β values/signs

### Critical reporting discrepancy (interpretation/output format)
- The **paper’s Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constants**.
- Your “table1style” outputs appear to be **standardized betas**, which is correct in principle—but your **model*_full** tables mix **b and beta**, and your narrative/significance sometimes tracks p-values from **unstandardized b**, while the “true” table uses stars tied to β (though significance is invariant to standardization *if* the same model/sample is used—yours isn’t).

**Fix:** Decide on one target:
- If matching the paper: output **β only** (plus constant unstandardized), with stars computed from the same OLS model. Do not present SEs if the target table doesn’t.

---

## 3) Variable-by-variable comparison (Table 1 standardized β)

Below I compare your **table1style β** to the **true β**.

### Model 1 (SES): all predictors + constant differ; R²/N differ
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (minor) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | slightly high |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | differs |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | differs |
| N | **747** | **787** | differs |

**Fix:** sample alignment is the most likely driver; also verify:
- Education measured in **years** exactly as in paper.
- Income per capita construction identical (equivalized? inflation-adjusted? top-coded?).
- Prestige variable matches (e.g., `prestg80` vs another prestige score; handling of missing/0).

### Model 2 (Demographic): multiple coefficient mismatches and two sign errors
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.263*** | **-0.246*** | too negative |
| Income pc | **-0.060** | **-0.054** | too negative |
| Prestige | **-0.016** | **-0.006** | too negative |
| Female | **-0.084***? (your star is *) | **-0.083***? (true is *) | magnitude matches; star ok |
| Age | **0.106***? (your star is *) | **0.140*** | too small; significance understated |
| Black | **0.040** | **0.029** | small difference |
| Hispanic | **0.063** | **-0.029** | **SIGN ERROR** |
| Other race | **-0.028** | **0.005** | **SIGN ERROR** |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.080** | **0.059** | too large |
| No religion | **-0.023** | **-0.012** | too negative |
| Southern | **0.067** | **0.097** | too small; missing ** significance (**)** |
| Constant | **9.593** | **8.507** | differs a lot |
| R² / Adj. R² | **0.141 / 0.122** | **0.151 / 0.139** | differs |
| N | **507** | **756** | differs hugely |

**Fixes (Model 2 specific):**
1. **Hispanic and Other race sign errors** strongly suggest a **coding/reference-category mismatch**:
   - The paper almost certainly uses **White (non-Hispanic)** as the reference and includes dummies for Black/Hispanic/Other.
   - You may have:
     - coded `hispanic` as 1=non-Hispanic (reversed),
     - or constructed “Other race” as “not other race” (reversed),
     - or used a different omitted category (e.g., omitted “Black” or omitted “White+Hispanic” combined).
   - **Concrete fix:** rebuild race/ethnicity indicators exactly:
     - `black = 1 if race==Black else 0`
     - `hispanic = 1 if ethnicity==Hispanic (regardless of race) else 0` (depending on GSS schema)
     - `otherrace = 1 if race in {Asian, Native American, other} and not Black/White`
     - omit **White non-Hispanic** as baseline.
2. **Southern**: your β is smaller and loses significance. This can happen from:
   - wrong regional variable (e.g., using “South” vs “born in South” vs “currently South”),
   - sample differences,
   - weighting differences.
   - **Fix:** confirm the exact GSS “South” indicator used in the paper (commonly `south=1` if region is South).
3. **Constant**: constants differ a lot across Model 2/3, again consistent with **different sample and/or different centering/standardization choices**.
   - **Fix:** do **not** standardize the dependent variable; compute standardized β for predictors via post-estimation transformation or fitting on standardized X only (leaving Y unstandardized), consistent with typical “standardized coefficients” reporting.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): several mismatches (esp. income, age, south, pol intolerance), plus N/R²
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.157***? (your star *) | **-0.151** (**) | close (stars differ) |
| Income pc | **-0.057** | **-0.009** | **major mismatch** |
| Prestige | **-0.018** | **-0.022** | close |
| Female | **-0.121***? (your star *) | **-0.095* ** | too negative |
| Age | **0.094 (ns)** | **0.110* ** | too small; significance mismatch |
| Black | **0.087** | **0.049** | too large |
| Hispanic | **0.042** | **0.031** | close |
| Other race | **0.048** | **0.053** | close |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.034** | **0.066** | too small |
| No religion | **0.018** | **0.024** | close |
| Southern | **0.074 (ns)** | **0.121** (**) | too small; loses significance |
| Political intolerance | **0.180** (**) | **0.164** (***) | magnitude differs; significance understated |
| Constant | **7.628** | **6.516** | differs |
| R² / Adj. R² | **0.150 / 0.113** | **0.169 / 0.148** | differs |
| N | **286** | **503** | differs hugely |

**Fixes (Model 3 specific):**
1. **Income per capita (β -0.057 vs -0.009)**: this is too far off to be rounding; likely you are using a *different income variable* (or transformation) than the paper.
   - Possibilities: raw household income (not per capita), logged income, or a version with different topcoding/missing recodes.
   - **Fix:** replicate the paper’s exact “household income per capita” construction (income divided by household size; handle 0/NA identically; same units).
2. **Political intolerance effect/significance**:
   - Your β is larger but less significant; with N=286 you have much less power.
   - **Fix:** restore N≈503 by using the correct `pol_intol` measure and not introducing extra listwise deletion.
3. **Age and Southern** are both attenuated and lose significance—again consistent with wrong sample and/or wrong variable definitions.

## 4) Standard errors: generated results include SE via p-values, but the “true” table does not report SE
- **Mismatch:** You can’t “match” SEs because the paper table **doesn’t provide them**.
- **Fix:** If the goal is to match Table 1, **remove SE output** and focus on β, constant, stars, R², adj. R², N.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by the output

### Stars/significance thresholds
- True table uses: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.
- Your stars for some variables differ (e.g., Model 3 political intolerance is ** in generated but *** in true; Model 3 education is * vs **).
- **Fix:** once sample/variables match, p-values should align closely. Also ensure:
  - two-tailed tests,
  - same df (OLS),
  - no robust/clustered SEs if the paper used conventional OLS SEs (or vice versa).

---

## 6) Why your N collapses (most important discrepancy) and how to fix it

Given your missingness table:
- outcome nonmissing: **893**
- pol_intol nonmissing: **850**
So Model 3 should not be anywhere near **286** unless you:
- accidentally required complete data on variables **not in the model**,
- used a **merged dataset** where many cases drop,
- filtered to a subgroup (e.g., only Whites, only Protestants, only respondents answering music questions),
- or recoded valid categories to NA (common with GSS “IAP/NA/Don’t know/Refused” codes).

**Concrete fixes to implement:**
1. **Re-estimate each model on its own variable set** (don’t pre-drop on the union of all variables across models).
2. **Audit recodes**: For each variable, confirm what values are treated as missing. In GSS, values like 8/9/0/98/99 often have special meanings depending on variable.
3. **Confirm the DV**: The paper DV is **Number of music genres disliked**. Your output shows `num_genres_disliked`, but ensure it matches the exact construction (same list of genres, same dislike threshold, same handling of “not asked”).
4. **Confirm year/sample**: Ensure it’s **GSS 1993** and the same respondent universe as the paper (some items are split-ballot).

---

## 7) Minimal checklist to make your generated analysis match the “true” table

1. Use the identical **DV construction** (count of disliked genres).
2. Use identical **IV constructions**:
   - `educ_yrs` (years),
   - `inc_pc` (per capita, same scaling/topcoding),
   - `prestg80_v` (same prestige scale),
   - race/ethnicity dummies with the same **reference group**,
   - `south` definition consistent with paper,
   - the same `pol_intol` scale (0–15) and missing coding.
3. Estimate **OLS** with the same **weighting choice** as the paper.
4. Compute **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and report **unstandardized constant**.
5. Ensure **model-specific listwise deletion** so N matches each model (787 / 756 / 503).
6. Apply the same significance thresholds and two-tailed tests.

If you paste your code (especially how you recoded Hispanic/Other race, income per capita, and how you subset rows for each model), I can pinpoint exactly which step creates the sign flips and the N collapse.
