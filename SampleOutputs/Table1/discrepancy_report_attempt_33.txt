## 1) Fit statistics / sample sizes (major mismatches)

### Model 1
- **n**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your analytic sample is too small. You’re dropping ~40 extra cases. Recreate Model 1 using the paper’s inclusion rules (likely *pairwise* or model-specific listwise deletion only on the variables in Model 1: DV + educ + inc_pc + prestige). Verify no extra filters (e.g., age restrictions, race recodes, invalid income codes) are being applied.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² 0.088**, **adj R² 0.085**
  - True: **R² 0.107**, **adj R² 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample matches (n=787) and the same variable construction is used, R² should move toward the reported values. Also ensure you are using **OLS with an intercept**, and that you’re not applying survey weights (unless the paper did—Table 1 suggests standard OLS betas).

### Model 2
- **n**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is not a small discrepancy; it indicates you are **needlessly losing cases**, likely due to (a) requiring non-missing on a variable not in the paper’s Model 2, or (b) coding missing categories (race/ethnicity, religion) into `NaN` instead of a valid dummy.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.135 / 0.118**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Align sample + coding; then recompute standardized coefficients from the same regression.

### Model 3
- **n**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** You are throwing away ~217 observations beyond what Model 3 should lose. Since the true table includes political intolerance and still has 503 cases, your construction of `pol_intol` is likely creating excessive missingness or you are inadvertently restricting to a subset (e.g., only respondents asked certain intolerance items).

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.145 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Again: correct the Model 3 analytic sample and political intolerance scale construction.

## 2) Variable-name / variable-presence mismatches

### “Other race” is dropped / NaN in generated models
- Generated Model 2 and 3 show:
  - `Other race` coefficient = **NaN**, and fit_stats says **dropped otherrace**
- True results include:
  - Model 2: **Other race β = 0.005**
  - Model 3: **Other race β = 0.053**

**Why this happens**
- Perfect collinearity or a dummy-trap error is the usual cause (e.g., you included *all* race dummies plus an intercept, or you constructed race in a way that makes `otherrace` redundant/constant in the reduced sample).
- Or `otherrace` is always 0/1 in your selected sample due to a filtering bug.

**Fix**
- Use **one omitted reference category** for race (e.g., White as reference) and include dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race **only** (not White), with an intercept.
- Check that `otherrace` varies in the analytic sample:
  - If `otherrace.nunique()==1`, your sample selection is wrong.
- Ensure Hispanic is not simultaneously treated as a race category that overlaps with Black/Other in an inconsistent way (paper treats Black/Hispanic/Other race as separate indicators).

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches (Table 1-style columns)

Below I compare **standardized coefficients β** because that is what the true Table 1 reports.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (minor) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | slightly high |
| Constant (unstd.) | **10.638** | **10.920** | lower |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | lower |
| n | **747** | **787** | lower |

**Fix:** Match Model 1 sample (n=787) and ensure the DV and IVs are coded exactly as in the paper (especially education years and income-per-capita handling of missing/top-codes).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.264*** | **-0.246*** | too large in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.053** | **-0.054** | close |
| Prestige | **-0.016** | **-0.006** | too negative |
| Female | **-0.090*** | **-0.083*** | close-ish (stars differ: you have `*`, true `*`) |
| Age | **0.104*** | **0.140*** | too small |
| Black | **0.043** | **0.029** | differs |
| Hispanic | **0.030** | **-0.029** | **sign is wrong** |
| Other race | **(blank/NaN)** | **0.005** | missing entirely |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.090** | **0.059** | too large |
| No religion | **-0.019** | **-0.012** | slightly more negative |
| Southern | **0.063** | **0.097** | too small; significance mismatch (true **)** |
| Constant (unstd.) | **9.285** | **8.507** | too high |
| R² / adj R² | **0.135 / 0.118** | **0.151 / 0.139** | too low |
| n | **507** | **756** | far too low |

**Key interpretation error risk:** Because your Hispanic effect flips sign relative to the paper, any narrative about Hispanic respondents disliking more genres would contradict the true table.

**Fixes (Model 2)**
1. **Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies** to match the paper’s definitions (likely mutually exclusive categories with White omitted).
2. **Stop dropping `otherrace`** (see dummy-trap fix above).
3. **Fix the analytic sample (n=756)**: listwise delete only on variables in Model 2 (DV + all Model 2 IVs), and ensure your recodes do not convert valid categories into missing.
4. Recompute **standardized betas** from the final OLS on the correct sample.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.157*** | **-0.151** ** | close (star differs) |
| Income pc | **-0.050** | **-0.009** | way too negative |
| Prestige | **-0.011** | **-0.022** | about half magnitude |
| Female | **-0.122*** | **-0.095*** | too negative |
| Age | **0.083 (ns)** | **0.110*** | too small + wrong significance |
| Black | **0.107** | **0.049** | too large |
| Hispanic | **0.028** | **0.031** | close |
| Other race | **(blank/NaN)** | **0.053** | missing entirely |
| Cons. Protestant | **0.037** | **0.066** | too small |
| No religion | **0.024** | **0.024** | matches |
| Southern | **0.065** | **0.121** | too small + wrong significance |
| Political intolerance | **0.190** ** | **0.164*** | too large and stars differ |
| Constant (unstd.) | **7.360** | **6.516** | too high |
| R² / adj R² | **0.145 / 0.111** | **0.169 / 0.148** | too low |
| n | **286** | **503** | far too low |

**Fixes (Model 3)**
1. **Political intolerance scale construction is almost certainly wrong** (or you’re applying it only to a subset). True Model 3 keeps **503** cases; your `pol_intol` missingness is ~47% (756 missing), collapsing n to 286 once combined with other missingness.  
   - Reconstruct `pol_intol` exactly as the paper: same items, same coding direction, same handling of “don’t know/refused/not asked,” and same aggregation rule (sum/mean and required minimum answered items).
2. After fixing `pol_intol`, rebuild the Model 3 sample by listwise deletion on Model 3 variables only.
3. Fix race dummies so `Other race` is included (not dropped).

## 4) Standard errors: generated vs true (interpretation mismatch)

- **Generated output reports p-values and implies standard errors were computed**, but
- **True Table 1 does not report SEs at all** (only β and stars).

This is not a numeric “SE mismatch” so much as a **reporting mismatch**:
- If you claim you are reproducing Table 1, you should **not present SEs/p-values as if they were in the table**, and you should ensure your stars correspond to the paper’s thresholds and sample.

**Fix**
- Either:
  1) Output only **standardized β + stars** (and constants unstandardized) to match the paper, **or**
  2) If you keep SE/p, explicitly label them as **your computed SE/p from the replication**, not extracted from Table 1.

---

## 5) Specific generated-table problems that prevent matching

### A) Your “Table1style” uses β but your full models use unstandardized b
That’s fine in principle, but it makes replication fragile if:
- betas are computed with a different standardization convention (sample SD vs population SD; handling of missing; standardizing before/after listwise deletion).

**Fix**
- Standardize *after* creating the exact analytic sample for each model (so SDs match the paper’s sample).
- Or compute β via:  
  \[
  \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
  \]
  using SDs from the **model’s estimation sample**.

### B) DV descriptives don’t align with the paper’s range label
Generated DV max is **18**, while the political intolerance variable is labeled (0–15). That’s fine (different variable), but ensure the DV “num_genres_disliked” is constructed identically to the paper (how many genres were available in 1993; how “dislike” was coded; treatment of missing per genre).

**Fix**
- Recreate DV from item-level genre responses with the same rule as the paper (e.g., count of “dislike” across a fixed set of genres; decide whether “neutral/never heard” count as not-dislike or missing).

---

## 6) What to change so the generated analysis matches the true Table 1

1. **Replicate the paper’s variable construction exactly**
   - DV: number of genres disliked (confirm included genres and coding).
   - `pol_intol`: confirm component items, scale range, and missing-data rule.
   - `inc_pc`: ensure per-capita conversion matches (household size handling, inflation/top-coding, missing codes).
   - `educ_yrs`, `prestg80_v`: confirm coding and missing codes.

2. **Use model-specific listwise deletion**
   - Model 1 target n=**787**
   - Model 2 target n=**756**
   - Model 3 target n=**503**
   If you can’t reach these n’s, inspect which variables are driving case loss and compare to the paper’s missing-data handling.

3. **Fix race/ethnicity dummy specification**
   - Ensure `Other race` is not collinear and not dropped.
   - Ensure Hispanic coding matches the paper (your sign flip in Model 2 strongly suggests a coding/definition mismatch).

4. **Report the same estimand**
   - Table 1 is **standardized OLS β**, constants unstandardized, **no SEs**.
   - Align significance stars to the same p-thresholds and (if applicable) same two-tailed tests.

If you share your exact coding/recode steps (especially for `pol_intol`, Hispanic/Other race, and sample filters), I can pinpoint precisely which transformation causes (a) the huge n drop and (b) the Hispanic sign reversal.
