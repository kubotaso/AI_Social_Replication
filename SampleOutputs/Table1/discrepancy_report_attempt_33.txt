============================================================

Below is a line-by-line reconciliation of what your **Generated Results** report vs. what the **True Results (Table 1 in PDF)** report, plus what you must change for the generated analysis to match the printed table.

Because the PDF table prints **standardized coefficients only** and **no standard errors**, any SEs in the generated output are *necessarily not comparable* to the “true” table.

---

## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is missing in Generated Models 2 and 3 (but present in True Results)**
- **True Results:** include **Hispanic** in Models 2 and 3 (with coefficients -0.029 and 0.031).
- **Generated Results:** explicitly notes: *“No Hispanic variable… not included in models.”*  
  Model 2 terms list has `black` and `other_race` but no `hispanic`. Same for Model 3.

**Fix**
- Add/construct the Hispanic indicator exactly as in the original study and include it in Models 2 and 3.
- If the dataset has race/ethnicity categories, you likely need mutually exclusive dummies (e.g., White as reference; Black, Hispanic, Other).
- Concretely: create `hispanic` and include it in the regression formula.

**Why it matters**
- Omitting a covariate changes coefficients of other race variables and potentially SES/political intolerance estimates (omitted-variable bias and/or changed sample due to missingness).

---

### B. **Political intolerance construction differs from the original table (likely)**
- **Generated note:** political intolerance requires “complete non-missing on all 15 tolerance items (strict)” and yields **N=426** and `political_intolerance_nonmissing=491`.
- **True Results:** Model 3 has **N=503**.

This is a major mismatch: you are using a stricter missing-data rule (or different item set / coding) than the published analysis.

**Fix**
- Reproduce the paper’s index construction and missing-data handling:
  - Same items (number and exact questions).
  - Same aggregation rule (sum/mean).
  - Same rule for missing items (e.g., allow up to k missing and average remaining; or require fewer than 15 complete).
- Then re-estimate Model 3 on the resulting sample. Your N should move toward **503**.

---

## 2) Sample size (N) mismatches

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Generated N:** 758  
- **True N:** 787  
**Mismatch:** -29 cases.

**Fix**
- Your complete-case filtering for Model 1 is too restrictive and/or variables are coded differently.
- Check missingness in DV and SES predictors; ensure you’re using the same year/subsample and same valid ranges/recodes as the study.
- Verify DV construction (“number of genres disliked”) matches exactly (same list of genres, same handling of “don’t know,” etc.).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Generated N:** 756  
- **True N:** 756  
**Match** (good).  
But note: even with matching N, your covariate set is not the same (missing Hispanic), so matching N here is somewhat coincidental and coefficients will differ.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Generated N:** 426  
- **True N:** 503  
**Mismatch:** -77 cases.

**Fix**
- Almost certainly due to (i) intolerance scale missingness rule and/or (ii) requiring complete data on more items than the original analysis required. See §1B.

---

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

The “True Results” table reports **standardized coefficients**. Your `coefficients_long beta_std` appears to be standardized betas too, so these can be compared directly.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated beta_std | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| educ | -0.3317 | -0.322 | Generated too negative |
| income_pc | -0.0339 | -0.037 | Generated less negative |
| prestg80 | +0.0294 | +0.016 | Generated larger positive |

**Fix**
- Primary driver is likely **different sample (N=758 vs 787)** and/or different operationalization of DV/SES variables.
- Ensure:
  - same weighting choice as original (if the paper uses weights; your generated output says **unweighted**),
  - same transformations (e.g., income per capita scaling, top-coding),
  - same standardization method (see §5).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated beta_std | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| educ | -0.2589 | -0.246 | too negative |
| income_pc | -0.0501 | -0.054 | slightly less negative |
| prestg80 | +0.0063 | -0.006 | **sign differs** |
| female | -0.0894 | -0.083 | too negative + significance differs |
| age | +0.1289 | +0.140 | too small |
| black | +0.0296 | +0.029 | ~matches |
| hispanic | (missing) | -0.029 | **omitted** |
| other_race | +0.0014 | +0.005 | smaller |
| cons_prot | +0.0666 | +0.059 | larger |
| no_religion | -0.0042 | -0.012 | closer to 0 |
| southern | +0.0837 | +0.097 | smaller + significance differs |

**Most important discrepancies**
- **Hispanic omitted** (spec mismatch).
- **Occupational prestige sign flip** (+0.006 vs -0.006). This commonly happens when:
  - different sample/weights,
  - different prestige variable coding,
  - different reference categories / dummy coding for race/region/religion,
  - or prestige variable not identical to “occupational prestige” used in the paper.

**Fix**
1. Add Hispanic.
2. Verify `prestg80` corresponds to the same prestige measure and coding (and is not reversed, standardized differently, or missing recodes).
3. Match weighting and standardization.

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated beta_std | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| educ | -0.1606 | -0.151 | too negative |
| income_pc | -0.0123 | -0.009 | too negative |
| prestg80 | -0.0078 | -0.022 | much closer to 0 than true |
| female | -0.1142 | -0.095 | too negative |
| age | +0.0603 | +0.110 | far too small |
| black | +0.0620 | +0.049 | too large |
| hispanic | (missing) | +0.031 | **omitted** |
| other_race | +0.0514 | +0.053 | ~matches |
| cons_prot | +0.0526 | +0.066 | smaller |
| no_religion | +0.0196 | +0.024 | ~matches |
| southern | +0.0869 | +0.121 | too small |
| polintol | +0.1665 | +0.164 | ~matches magnitude, but stars differ (see below) |

**Fix**
- Biggest issues: **N mismatch (426 vs 503)** and **Hispanic omitted**.
- Rebuild political intolerance and relax missingness to reproduce N≈503, add Hispanic, then re-estimate.

---

## 4) Significance-star / interpretation mismatches

Even when coefficients are close, your stars often don’t match the printed table. Example:
- Model 3 political intolerance:
  - **Generated:** `0.166**` with p=0.00147 (that is actually **p < .01**, so ** should be correct under your thresholds)
  - **True:** `0.164***` (p < .001)

This discrepancy can come from:
- different **standard errors** (weights, clustering, heteroskedastic-robust vs classical),
- different **sample** (N=426 vs 503),
- different **construction of intolerance** (variance changes),
- different **test** (two-tailed is stated in true; you used two-tailed, but SE differences dominate).

**Fix**
- Match the original inference method:
  - If the paper uses survey weights and design-based SEs, use them.
  - If it uses robust SEs, replicate robust SE choice.
  - Use the same sample definition and variable construction.

---

## 5) Standard errors: “true” table has none (generated SEs cannot be “matched”)

### Problem
- **True Results:** explicitly: *standard errors not printed.*
- **Generated Results:** table shows a second line under each coefficient that looks like SEs (e.g., educ: “-0.332***” then “-0.034”), plus you have `b_raw` and p-values.

These SEs are not “wrong” per se, but they are **not comparable** to Table 1 because Table 1 does not report SEs.

**Fix (presentation)**
- If your goal is to match the published Table 1: **remove SE rows from the output table**, and print standardized betas only with stars.
- Or label the second line explicitly as “SE (not in published Table 1)” and do not claim it matches the PDF.

**Fix (if you still want stars to match)**
- You must match the original SE computation method (weights/design/robustness) and sample. Otherwise p-values/stars will differ.

---

## 6) Model fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj. R², constants)

### R² / Adj. R²
- **Model 1:** Generated R²=0.1088 vs True 0.107 (close)
- **Model 2:** Generated 0.1452 vs True 0.151 (noticeable)
- **Model 3:** Generated 0.1394 vs True 0.169 (large gap)

**Fix**
- Model 3 gap is consistent with your **smaller N** and likely different intolerance construction (less explanatory power).
- Model 2 may move once you include **Hispanic** and match weights.

### Constants
- **Model 1:** 11.086 vs 10.920
- **Model 2:** 8.788 vs 8.507
- **Model 3:** 7.355 vs 6.516

Note: constants in standardized-coefficient tables are often from the *unstandardized model* while betas are standardized—papers sometimes mix reporting conventions. Your constants are coming from your OLS on your sample; they will change with sample, DV coding, and covariate set.

**Fix**
- Match DV coding and sample (and covariate set—especially Hispanic).
- Confirm whether the published constant is from the same model specification (unstandardized) and same weighting.

---

## 7) Interpretation mismatch risk: “unweighted OLS” vs likely survey design

Your diagnostics note: **“OLS unweighted.”** If the original study used survey weights (common with GSS-like data), then:
- coefficients (even standardized) can differ,
- and especially SEs/p-values/stars can differ.

**Fix**
- Check the paper’s methods: if weights were used, re-run using the same weight variable and (if applicable) design-based SEs.

---

# What to change so the generated analysis matches Table 1

In priority order:

1. **Add Hispanic** to Models 2 and 3 (correct dummy coding and reference group).
2. **Recreate political intolerance exactly** (same items + same missing-data rule) so that **Model 3 N ≈ 503**, not 426.
3. **Make Model 1 sample match (N=787)** by aligning missing-data rules and DV construction.
4. **Match weighting / survey design / SE method** used in the published study (this is crucial for stars).
5. **Match output format** to the PDF: print **standardized coefficients only** (no SE rows), since the true table doesn’t include SEs.
6. Re-check `prestg80` construction/coding to resolve the Model 2 sign discrepancy on occupational prestige.

If you share (a) the code that builds `num_genres_disliked` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) the list of raw variables used for Hispanic and tolerance items, I can point to the exact lines that are causing the N drop and coefficient shifts.
