### 1) Fit statistics and sample sizes don’t match Table 1

**Mismatches**
- **Model 1 n:** Generated **747** vs True **787**
- **Model 2 n:** Generated **507** vs True **756**
- **Model 3 n:** Generated **286** vs True **503**

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Model 1: Generated **0.088 / 0.085** vs True **0.107 / 0.104**
  - Model 2: Generated **0.135 / 0.118** vs True **0.151 / 0.139**
  - Model 3: Generated **0.145 / 0.111** vs True **0.169 / 0.148**

**Likely causes**
- You are doing **listwise deletion on variables that the paper did not delete on**, especially **pol_intol** (47% missing per your missingness table). That alone can collapse Model 3 to ~286.
- You may also be applying **extra filters** (e.g., restricting to complete cases for *all* three models at once, or restricting to a different population than the paper).

**How to fix**
- Recreate the paper’s *estimation samples model-by-model*:
  - Model 1 should drop only cases missing **educ_yrs, inc_pc, prestg80_v, DV**.
  - Model 2 should drop only cases missing Model 1 vars + demographics.
  - Model 3 should drop only cases missing Model 2 vars + **pol_intol**.
- If you are currently doing something like `drop_na(all predictors across all models)`, stop—do it **separately per model**.
- Verify you are using the **same GSS year (1993)** and the **same DV construction** as the paper.

### 2) “Other race” is missing/NaN in generated models but present in the true table

**Mismatches**
- Generated Model 2 and 3: **Other race = NaN** and shown as “dropped otherrace”
- True Model 2: **Other race β = 0.005**
- True Model 3: **Other race β = 0.053**

**Likely causes**
- Perfect collinearity / singularity from dummy coding (e.g., including **Black, Hispanic, Other race** *and* also an intercept with a reference category incorrectly specified).
- Or “otherrace” is constant/empty after filtering (e.g., a sub-sample with no “other race” respondents).

**How to fix**
- Ensure race is coded with a **clear reference group** (typically White) and only **K−1 dummies** are included.
  - Example: include `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` with **White omitted** and keep the intercept.
- Check counts after filtering: `table(otherrace)` within each model’s analytic sample; if it’s all 0/1 with no variation, your sample restriction is wrong.

### 3) Standardized coefficients (β) in the generated “Table1-style” output do not match the true β’s

Below I compare the **standardized** coefficients (your Table1-style values) to the paper’s β.

#### Model 1 (SES)
- **Education:** Generated **-0.292*** vs True **-0.322***  → mismatch (too small in magnitude)
- **Income pc:** Generated **-0.039** vs True **-0.037** → close, small mismatch
- **Prestige:** Generated **0.020** vs True **0.016** → mismatch
- **Constant:** Generated **10.638** vs True **10.920** → mismatch

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Education:** Generated **-0.264*** vs True **-0.246*** → mismatch (too large in magnitude)
- **Income pc:** Generated **-0.053** vs True **-0.054** → very close
- **Prestige:** Generated **-0.016** vs True **-0.006** → mismatch
- **Female:** Generated **-0.090***? (star shown as *) vs True **-0.083***? (true is *) → coefficient mismatch
- **Age:** Generated **0.104***? (only *) vs True **0.140*** → mismatch (and stars mismatch)
- **Black:** Generated **0.043** vs True **0.029** → mismatch
- **Hispanic:** Generated **0.030** vs True **-0.029** → **sign mismatch**
- **Other race:** missing vs True **0.005** → missing variable result
- **Cons. Protestant:** Generated **0.090** vs True **0.059** → mismatch
- **No religion:** Generated **-0.019** vs True **-0.012** → mismatch
- **Southern:** Generated **0.063** vs True **0.097** → mismatch (and stars mismatch)
- **Constant:** Generated **9.285** vs True **8.507** → mismatch

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Education:** Generated **-0.157***? (shown *) vs True **-0.151** (true **)** → minor mismatch + stars mismatch
- **Income pc:** Generated **-0.050** vs True **-0.009** → **large mismatch**
- **Prestige:** Generated **-0.011** vs True **-0.022** → mismatch
- **Female:** Generated **-0.122***? (shown *) vs True **-0.095***? (true *) → mismatch
- **Age:** Generated **0.083 (ns)** vs True **0.110* ** → mismatch and significance mismatch
- **Black:** Generated **0.107** vs True **0.049** → mismatch
- **Hispanic:** Generated **0.028** vs True **0.031** → close
- **Other race:** missing vs True **0.053** → missing variable result
- **Cons. Protestant:** Generated **0.037** vs True **0.066** → mismatch
- **No religion:** Generated **0.024** vs True **0.024** → matches
- **Southern:** Generated **0.065** vs True **0.121** → mismatch and stars mismatch
- **Political intolerance:** Generated **0.190** vs True **0.164** → mismatch (and stars mismatch: ** vs ***)
- **Constant:** Generated **7.360** vs True **6.516** → mismatch

**How to fix (β mismatches)**
These β discrepancies are not “rounding error”; they indicate you are not reproducing the paper’s exact specification/sample/variable construction. To align:
1. **Use the exact same DV**: the paper DV is “Number of music genres disliked.” Confirm your `num_genres_disliked` is constructed identically (same genre list, same coding of “dislike,” same handling of DK/NA).
2. **Use the same year/sample**: restrict to **GSS 1993** and any paper-specific eligibility rules.
3. **Replicate weighting** (if used): if the paper applied a weight and you did not (or vice versa), β and R² will shift. Check the paper’s methods.
4. **Match coding of predictors**:
   - Education: years, not categories.
   - Income per capita: confirm the exact transformation (some papers log income, adjust for household size in a particular way, top-code, etc.). Your Model 3 income β being wildly off (−0.050 vs −0.009) is a red flag for **different income definition or scaling**.
   - Prestige: confirm you’re using the correct prestige scale version and treatment of missing.
   - Religion region dummies: ensure definitions match the paper (e.g., “Conservative Protestant” coding often depends on denomination scheme).
5. **Standardization method**: Table 1 reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. Make sure you compute β the same way:
   - Either run OLS on **z-scored** variables (DV and continuous IVs, and often dummies left unstandardized depending on convention), or compute β from unstandardized b using SD ratios.
   - Your table mixes **unstandardized constants** (fine) with β’s; ensure that’s exactly what you’re doing.

### 4) Significance stars and p-values don’t line up with the true stars

**Mismatches (examples)**
- Model 2 **Age:** Generated p=0.0176 → *; True shows **0.140*** (***).
- Model 2 **Southern:** Generated p=0.15 (ns); True **0.097** with ** (p<.01)**.
- Model 3 **Political intolerance:** Generated p=0.00265 → **; True ***.

**How to fix**
- Once the **sample and variable construction** match, stars will usually fall into place.
- Also ensure the paper’s stars are **two-tailed** (your “True Results” says two-tailed) and that your model uses the same:
  - same estimator (OLS),
  - same handling of weights/robust SEs (if the paper used robust or design-based SEs, your p-values will differ even if coefficients match),
  - same degrees of freedom (affected by n and missingness).

### 5) Variable name/label mismatches (presentation)

**Mismatches**
- Generated shows “Education (years)”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, etc., while the true table uses shorter names. This is mostly cosmetic, but…
- Generated includes “Political intolerance (0–15)” label; true table uses “Political intolerance”. If your scale is truly 0–15, confirm the paper’s scale is identical.

**How to fix**
- Align labels, but more importantly confirm the **underlying variables** are identical (range, coding, missing handling).

---

### 6) Generated results report standard errors implicitly via p-values, but the “true” table has no SEs

**Mismatch**
- Your generated output includes p-values and thus implies specific SEs; the “true results” explicitly say **SE not reported**.
- This isn’t a numerical mismatch per se, but it’s an **interpretation/reporting mismatch**: you can’t claim disagreement in SE with the table because the table doesn’t provide them.

**How to fix**
- When comparing to the paper’s Table 1, compare only:
  - standardized β,
  - constants,
  - R²/Adj R²,
  - n,
  - and significance stars.
- If you want to compare SEs, you need the paper’s appendix/output or you must state: “SEs not comparable because not reported.”

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1
1. Restrict to **GSS 1993** and reproduce the paper’s DV exactly.
2. Recreate each model’s **analytic sample** to hit n = **787 / 756 / 503**.
3. Fix race dummy coding so **Other race** is estimated (not dropped).
4. Verify income-per-capita and political intolerance scales/coding match the paper.
5. Apply the same **weights and SE approach** (OLS vs robust/design-based) as the paper.
6. Compute and report **standardized coefficients (β)** exactly as the paper does, and keep constants unstandardized.

If you paste your exact model formulas + any filtering/`drop_na` logic + whether weights/robust SEs are used, I can pinpoint which step is causing each of the big divergences (especially the n collapse and the missing “Other race”).
