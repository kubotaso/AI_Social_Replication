### 1) Variable-name and labeling mismatches

**A. DV labeling is fine, but the table body is unlabeled in the “Generated Results.”**  
- **Generated table1_style** shows a column of numbers with no row labels (it’s impossible to verify which coefficient belongs to which variable just by looking at that block).  
- **True table** has explicit variable names.

**Fix:** Ensure `table1_style` prints a labeled row for each term (Education, income, prestige, etc.) in the correct order. This is a presentation bug: join the coefficient vector to a term-name vector before printing.

**B. Term names differ slightly from the “True Results” names (cosmetic but important for matching).**  
- Generated uses: `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `political_intolerance`.  
- True table uses: “Education”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, “Conservative Protestant”, “No religion”, “Political intolerance”.

**Fix:** Map internal variable names to the Table 1 display names when producing the comparison table (a simple rename dictionary), but keep the underlying variables unchanged.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **every coefficient mismatch** between the generated standardized betas (`beta_std`) and the true standardized coefficients.

#### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | **-0.3317** | **-0.322** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.0339 | -0.037 | slightly off |
| Prestige | **0.0294** | **0.016** | too high |

**Fix:** This pattern strongly suggests you did **not replicate the same sample and/or the same standardization procedure** used in the PDF. See Section 4 (sample size mismatch) and Section 5 (standardization).

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | **-0.3020** | **-0.246** | substantially too negative |
| Income pc | -0.0566 | -0.054 | close |
| Prestige | -0.0075 | -0.006 | close |
| Female | -0.0776 | -0.083 | close (sig differs; see below) |
| Age | **0.1089** | **0.140** | too small |
| Black | **0.0529** | **0.029** | too large |
| Hispanic | -0.0172 | -0.029 | off |
| Other race | **-0.0159** | **0.005** | sign differs |
| Conservative Protestant | **0.0400** | **0.059** | too small |
| No religion | -0.0162 | -0.012 | close |
| Southern | **0.0789** | **0.097** | too small |

**Fix:** Again, this is not a rounding issue. It indicates the model was fit on a **different estimation sample and/or different codings** (especially “Other race” sign flip) than the published model.

#### Model 3 (Political Intolerance)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.1571 | -0.151 | close (sig differs) |
| Income pc | **-0.0670** | **-0.009** | huge mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.0084 | -0.022 | off |
| Female | **-0.1183** | **-0.095** | too negative |
| Age | **0.0918** | **0.110** | too small |
| Black | **0.0043** | **0.049** | far too small |
| Hispanic | **0.0913** | **0.031** | too large |
| Other race | 0.0528 | 0.053 | matches |
| Conservative Protestant | **-0.0107** | **0.066** | sign differs |
| No religion | 0.0179 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | **0.0733** | **0.121** | too small |
| Political intolerance | **0.1956** | **0.164** | too large |

**Fix:** Model 3 is especially inconsistent, which is what you’d expect if (a) the *political intolerance scale* was constructed differently (items/required completion/reverse-coding), and/or (b) you used a much smaller listwise sample than the paper (you did).

---

### 3) Standard errors: generated vs. “true”

**Core discrepancy:** The **True Results explicitly say the PDF table does not report standard errors**, while the **Generated Results table prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like an SE** (e.g., “-0.332***” then “-0.034”).

- Because the “true” table does not contain SEs, you **cannot claim agreement or mismatch on SEs** relative to Table 1.
- Also: the printed “SEs” in `table1_style` don’t correspond to anything in `coefficients_long` (which contains p-values but not SEs). So internally, your pipeline is mixing outputs: standardized betas + (maybe) raw-model SEs, or SEs of standardized betas computed ad hoc.

**Fix options (choose one depending on your goal):**
1. **To match the PDF exactly:** remove standard errors entirely from the printed table; print only standardized coefficients and stars.  
2. **If you want SEs anyway:** compute and label them correctly (e.g., “robust SE of standardized coefficient”), and do **not** describe them as “as printed” or “from Table 1.”

### 4) N, R², Adjusted R², constant: systematic mismatches

These are major and explain many coefficient differences.

#### Sample sizes (N)
| Model | Generated N | True N | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Model 1 | **758** | **787** | -29 |
| Model 2 | **523** | **756** | -233 |
| Model 3 | **293** | **503** | -210 |

**Fix:** Your listwise deletion is far more aggressive than the paper’s.

The smoking gun is **Hispanic** missingness:
- Generated missingness shows `hispanic` has **281 missing out of 893**, which collapses Model 2 from ~756 down to 523.
- In most survey datasets, “Hispanic” is often **derivable** from ethnicity/race items; missing that many values suggests your `hispanic` variable is coded with missing for “No” (0) or for non-asked cases.

**How to fix Hispanic coding**
- Verify that “not Hispanic” is coded as **0**, not NA.
- If Hispanic is derived from an ethnicity question, recode:
  - `hispanic = 1` if respondent Hispanic
  - `hispanic = 0` if respondent explicitly not Hispanic
  - `NA` only if truly not ascertained
- If the paper used a different race/ethnicity scheme (common): they may have **no missing** because they used an existing constructed variable from the archive.

**Fix political_intolerance construction / missingness**
- You required **15/15 items** (“15/15 items required”), leaving only **491 nonmissing** on the DV-complete subset and ultimately **N=293** listwise. The paper reports **N=503**, so they likely:
  - allowed some missing items (e.g., mean of nonmissing if at least k items answered), and/or
  - used a different item count, and/or
  - used imputation or pairwise handling before listwise regression sample formation.

To match the paper, you must replicate their scale rule (typical fixes):
- Use **“at least k of m items”** (e.g., ≥ 10 of 15) and take the mean/sum of available items.
- Confirm reverse-coding and item inclusion exactly.

#### R² and Adjusted R²
| Model | Generated R² | True R² | Generated Adj R² | True Adj R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Model 1 | 0.1088 | 0.107 | 0.1052 | 0.104 |
| Model 2 | **0.1572** | **0.151** | 0.1391 | 0.139 |
| Model 3 | **0.1515** | **0.169** | **0.1151** | **0.148** |

Model 2 R² difference is modest; Model 3 is meaningfully off and adj-R² is way lower because your N is far smaller.

**Fix:** once N/codings match, re-estimate; R² should move toward the published values.

#### Constants
| Model | Generated constant | True constant | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Model 1 | 11.086 | 10.920 | off |
| Model 2 | **10.089** | **8.507** | big mismatch |
| Model 3 | **7.583** | **6.516** | mismatch |

**Fix:** constants are on the **unstandardized DV scale**, and are very sensitive to:
- the estimation sample,
- whether weights are used,
- whether you centered predictors,
- whether the DV is constructed identically.

Given your N problems, these constant mismatches are expected. Fix the sample and variable construction first.

### 5) Significance stars / interpretation mismatches

Even where coefficients are close, the **stars differ**.

Examples:
- Model 2: **female** is *not significant* in generated (p≈0.061) but is **-0.083\*** in true.  
- Model 2: **southern** is not significant in generated (p≈0.061) but is **0.097\*\*** in true.  
- Model 3: **education** is `*` in generated but `**` in true; **age** not significant generated but `*` in true; **political intolerance** is `**` generated but `***` in true.

**Fix:** Stars will not align until you replicate:
- the **same N/sample definition**,
- any **survey weights / design corrections** (if the original used them),
- the **same standardization** method (see below),
- the same **coding of dummies** (especially race/region/religion).

---

### 6) Likely root causes (and targeted fixes)

1) **Different estimation sample than the paper (major).**  
   - Your Model 2/3 Ns are drastically smaller.
   - Fix Hispanic coding (0 vs NA) and political intolerance missing-data rule.

2) **Political intolerance scale not replicated.**  
   - Your “15/15 required” is likely stricter than the paper.
   - Fix by matching the paper’s scale construction (item list, reverse codes, minimum answered items).

3) **Possible weighting/design mismatch.**  
   - Many sociology survey analyses use weights; unweighted OLS will shift coefficients, constants, and p-values.
   - Fix: check the PDF methods section; if weights were used, replicate weighted regression and (if applicable) robust/clustered SEs.

4) **Standardization procedure mismatch.**  
   The true table reports “standardized OLS coefficients.” That usually means:
   - run OLS on **unstandardized variables**, then compute standardized betas as \( b \cdot \frac{sd(X)}{sd(Y)} \), *on the estimation sample* (and possibly weighted SDs if weighted).
   If you instead z-scored variables first, or used population SDs, or standardized with a different sample, you’ll drift.
   - Fix: compute standardized betas exactly the way the authors did (often post-hoc using sample SDs on the model’s analytic sample).

---

### 7) What to change so the generated analysis matches the “True Results”

Checklist in order:

1. **Recode `hispanic` so “not Hispanic” is 0 (not missing).** Re-run Model 2 N should jump toward ~756.
2. **Rebuild `political_intolerance` using the paper’s rule** (items, reverse-coding, minimum completion threshold). Re-run Model 3 N should jump toward ~503.
3. **Verify dummy reference categories** match the paper (race, religion, region). Sign flips (e.g., conservative_protestant in Model 3) often come from different baselines or miscodings.
4. **Confirm whether weights were used**; if yes, re-estimate with weights and appropriate SEs.
5. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way as the paper** (post-estimation vs pre-zscoring; weighted vs unweighted SD).
6. **Revise the output table** to (a) label rows and (b) remove SEs if you’re claiming to reproduce Table 1.

If you paste the code you used to construct `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` (and whether you used weights), I can point to the exact lines that are producing the N collapse and the sign flips.
