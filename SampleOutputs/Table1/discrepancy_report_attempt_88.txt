### 1) Fit statistics / sample sizes (major mismatches)

**Model 1**
- **n (cases):** Generated **747** vs True **787** → mismatch (−40 cases).
- **R²:** Generated **0.088** vs True **0.107** → mismatch (too low).
- **Adj. R²:** Generated **0.0846** vs True **0.104** → mismatch (too low).

**How to fix**
- Your analytic sample construction is not matching the paper’s. You are doing listwise deletion on variables with missingness that likely differs from the paper’s inclusion rules or variable coding.
- Ensure you are using the **same year/subsample (GSS 1993)** and the **same dependent variable construction** as the paper.
- Recreate *exactly* the paper’s missing-data handling (likely listwise deletion but on the paper’s exact variables/codings). Verify you didn’t inadvertently introduce extra missingness (e.g., from recodes).

**Model 2**
- **n:** Generated **745** vs True **756** → mismatch (−11).
- **R²:** Generated **0.126** vs True **0.151** → mismatch.
- **Adj. R²:** Generated **0.113** vs True **0.139** → mismatch.

**How to fix**
- Same issue: sample definition/coding differs. Confirm race, religion, region, and education/income/prestige are coded identically and not producing extra NAs.

**Model 3**
- **n:** Generated **421** vs True **503** → mismatch (−82).
- **R²:** Generated **0.135** vs True **0.169** → mismatch.
- **Adj. R²:** Generated **0.112** vs True **0.148** → mismatch.
- Generated output says **dropped_predictors = otherrace** and shows **Other race = NaN** → the paper includes “Other race” with a coefficient.

**How to fix**
- You have a **model matrix / factor-level problem** (or a no-variation problem after filtering) causing `otherrace` to be dropped.
  - Check that `otherrace` isn’t perfectly collinear (e.g., you included all race dummies **plus** an intercept, or accidentally created overlapping race indicators).
  - Use **one** reference category: include `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` with **white as reference**, and keep the intercept.
  - Verify `otherrace` has nonzero variance in the Model 3 estimation sample (after listwise deletion on pol_intol). If it becomes all 0s, your subsetting is wrong.
- The huge N loss is consistent with your missingness table: `pol_intol` missing ~47%. But the paper still gets **503**, not **421**, so your `pol_intol` recode is likely creating *extra* missing values (e.g., treating valid codes as missing).

### 2) Variable name mismatches / mapping issues

**Dependent variable**
- True: “Number of Music Genres Disliked”
- Generated uses `num_genres_disliked` (fine), but you must ensure it is constructed the same way (same genre items, same handling of DK/NA, same range).

**Political intolerance**
- True: “Political intolerance” (0–15 in your generated label)
- Generated variable: `pol_intol`
- The *name* isn’t the problem; the **coding/range/valid-missing handling** likely is, given the n mismatch.

**Race**
- True model includes “Other race” with β=0.053 in Model 3.
- Generated: “Other race” is present in Model 2 but **dropped in Model 3**.

**How to fix**
- Ensure race dummies are created consistently and that **exactly one category is omitted**.
- If race is a single categorical variable in the raw data, prefer `factor(race)` with a chosen reference, rather than manually assembling potentially inconsistent dummies.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized β in Table 1)

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constants**. Your “Table1style” appears to be reporting **betas for predictors** (good), but many values don’t match.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | **Mismatch** |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | Close but **not exact** |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | **Mismatch** |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | **Mismatch** |
| R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | **Mismatch** |
| n | 747 | 787 | **Mismatch** |

**Fix**
- Once you fix the **sample (n=787)** and the **exact variable codings**, the βs and constant should move toward the paper’s.
- Also ensure the β calculation matches the paper’s: β from OLS with variables standardized (or computed post hoc as \(b \cdot \frac{SD_x}{SD_y}\)). Small differences can arise if you standardize on a different sample than the estimation sample—so standardize using the **model’s estimation sample**.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

Key mismatches:

| Term | Gen β | True β | Direction issue? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.229*** | -0.246*** | mismatch |
| Income pc | -0.055 | -0.054 | close |
| Prestige | 0.005 | -0.006 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close |
| Age | 0.126*** | 0.140*** | mismatch |
| Black | 0.017 | 0.029 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.055 | -0.029 | **sign mismatch (big)** |
| Other race | 0.022 | 0.005 | mismatch |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.101** | 0.059 | mismatch (and stars differ) |
| No religion | 0.000 | -0.012 | mismatch |
| Southern | 0.070 | 0.097** | mismatch (and stars differ) |
| Constant | 8.139 | 8.507 | mismatch |
| R² | 0.126 | 0.151 | mismatch |
| n | 745 | 756 | mismatch |

**Fixes (diagnostic priorities)**
1. **Hispanic sign flip** strongly suggests a **coding/reference-category mistake**:
   - e.g., you might have coded `hispanic=1` for non-Hispanic, or mixed up “Hispanic” with another category, or used a different baseline when constructing dummies.
   - Verify the dummy is **1 for Hispanic respondents** and 0 otherwise, with white non-Hispanic as reference (as in typical GSS setups).
2. **Prestige sign mismatch** also suggests either:
   - different prestige variable (wrong field), reverse coding, or
   - different standardization basis (but standardization wouldn’t flip sign if b’s sign is correct).
3. **Conservative Protestant** much larger in your results (0.101 vs 0.059) points to different definition of the religious tradition variable.
   - Ensure the exact operationalization used in the paper (often derived from denomination + fundamentalism/evangelical classification).
4. **Southern** effect too small and loses ** significance compared to true (0.097**)** → likely sample/coding issues.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | Gen β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.146* | -0.151** | close-ish, stars differ |
| Income pc | -0.015 | -0.009 | mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.001 | -0.022 | mismatch |
| Female | -0.099* | -0.095* | close |
| Age | 0.054 | 0.110* | **big mismatch** |
| Black | 0.074 | 0.049 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.091 | 0.031 | mismatch |
| Other race | (missing) | 0.053 | **missing** |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.096 | 0.066 | mismatch |
| No religion | 0.029 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.070 | 0.121** | mismatch |
| Political intolerance | 0.179*** | 0.164*** | mismatch |
| Constant | 6.590 | 6.516 | mismatch |
| R² | 0.135 | 0.169 | mismatch |
| n | 421 | 503 | mismatch |

**Fixes**
- **Dropped “Other race”** must be fixed (see collinearity/no-variance issue above).
- **Age** is far smaller than the true result: this often happens if:
  - age was rescaled or recoded (e.g., centered/standardized incorrectly),
  - the analytic sample is different (yours is much smaller), or
  - you accidentally used a different “age” variable (e.g., age category rather than continuous).
- Political intolerance β is too large; again could be sample or coding differences (range 0–15 must match the paper; if you inadvertently compressed or expanded the variance, β changes).

### 4) Standard errors: what’s mismatched

- The **True Results explicitly say SEs are not reported in Table 1**.
- Your generated output includes **p-values and stars** derived from SEs, and your “table1style” includes stars.
- This is not a “numerical mismatch” against Table 1 (because Table 1 doesn’t provide SEs), but it *is* an **interpretive/reporting mismatch** if you imply the table reproduces the paper’s uncertainty estimates.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match Table 1: report **β and stars only** (no SE/p derived from your run unless you clearly label them as computed from your replication).
- If the goal is to replicate the paper exactly: match the stars by matching the coefficients/sample/coding; don’t introduce SE columns for Table 1.

---

### 5) Interpretation/reporting mismatches

1. **You treat “Table1style” as if it reproduces Table 1**, but several coefficients/signs/stars differ (notably Hispanic, prestige, Southern, Cons. Protestant).
2. **Model 3 “dropped_predictors: otherrace”** contradicts the true model specification and the paper’s reported coefficient.

**Fix**
- Add a “replication check” step: after constructing each model frame, verify:
  - n matches the paper,
  - all predictors are present,
  - dummy variables have expected proportions,
  - reference categories are correct.

---

### 6) Concrete steps to make generated match true (actionable checklist)

1. **Recreate the exact analytic sample**
   - Filter to **GSS 1993** and the same respondent universe as the paper.
   - Apply the same exclusion rules.
2. **Recode missing values correctly**
   - For GSS items, convert DK/NA/INAP codes to missing *exactly as the paper does*.
   - Your `pol_intol` is likely over-missing: inspect its raw codes and your recode.
3. **Verify dummy coding / reference categories**
   - Race: include **three** dummies (Black, Hispanic, Other race) with White as reference.
   - Region: Southern dummy consistent with census region definition used.
   - Religion: reconstruct Conservative Protestant / No religion exactly as in the article.
4. **Ensure you’re reporting standardized β**
   - Compute β in the **estimation sample** for each model.
   - Keep constants unstandardized.
5. **Re-run and compare**
   - Expect to match: **n (787/756/503)**, **R² (0.107/0.151/0.169)**, and each β in Table 1.

If you share the code you used to (a) build `pol_intol`, (b) build race/religion dummies, and (c) subset to 1993, I can pinpoint exactly why Hispanic flips sign and why `otherrace` is dropped in Model 3.
