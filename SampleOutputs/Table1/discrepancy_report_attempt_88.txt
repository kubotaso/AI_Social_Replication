## 1) Variable name / inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is missing in the generated models (but present in the true table)**
- **Generated:** `hispanic` is all missing (893 missing, 0 nonmissing), shown as “—”, coefficient = `NaN`, and implicitly *dropped*.
- **True:** Hispanic is included in Models 2 and 3 with coefficients **-0.029** (M2) and **0.031** (M3).

**Fix**
- Construct/obtain the Hispanic indicator correctly from the raw race/ethnicity variables (often `hispanic` or `ethnic`, sometimes a separate question). Do **not** create it from race alone if the dataset codes ethnicity separately.
- After constructing it, rerun Models 2–3 so Hispanic is estimated and N increases accordingly.

---

### B. **“Household income per capita” vs `income_pc` (likely a construction mismatch)**
- Names are basically aligned, but the *values/significance* don’t match the printed table (see coefficient mismatches below), which strongly suggests your `income_pc` construction (equivalization/per-capita division, inflation adjustment, top-coding handling) doesn’t match what the original authors used.

**Fix**
- Replicate the original definition exactly:
  - confirm whether it is **household income / household size** (per capita) or something else (e.g., equivalized income),
  - confirm which income measure (annual? category-to-midpoint?),
  - handle **top-codes** and **missing codes** exactly as in the codebook,
  - ensure any scaling (e.g., thousands of dollars) is consistent *before* standardization.

---

### C. Standardization method mismatch (highly likely)
The “True Results” are explicitly **standardized OLS coefficients**. Your generated output uses `beta_std`, but the pattern of mismatches across many predictors suggests your standardization procedure doesn’t match theirs (or you standardized some variables but not others, or standardized within different samples).

**Fix**
- Ensure you compute standardized coefficients the same way as the source:
  - The most defensible replication: run OLS on **z-scored DV and z-scored continuous IVs** (and appropriate treatment for binaries), *within the model’s estimation sample*.
  - Alternatively: compute betas from unstandardized regression using \( \beta^* = \beta \cdot \frac{s_x}{s_y} \).
- Critically: standardize using **the exact analytic sample per model**, not the larger “music complete” sample.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (term-by-term)

Below I list **Generated vs True** (standardized betas).

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.310***  
  - True: **-0.322***  
  - **Mismatch** (magnitude).
  - **Fix:** sample size mismatch (N 748 vs 787) and/or standardization differences.

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.038**  
  - True: **-0.037**  
  - Very close; likely fine (rounding/sample).

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **0.025**  
  - True: **0.016**  
  - **Mismatch**.
  - **Fix:** standardization and/or prestige variable coding mismatch (e.g., using `prestg80` correctly, handling missing codes, scaling).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.848**  
  - True: **10.920**
  - **Mismatch** (also consistent with different analytic sample / different variable scaling).

- **Fit / N**
  - Generated: **N=748, R²=0.097, Adj R²=0.094**
  - True: **N=787, R²=0.107, Adj R²=0.104**
  - **Mismatch** (substantial). This is not a rounding issue—your sample or variables differ.

  - Small mismatch; probably sample/standardization.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **0.009**
  - True: **-0.006**
  - **Sign mismatch**.
  - **Fix:** prestige coding/cleaning and/or standardization differences.

- **Female**
  - Generated: **-0.078***? (table shows -0.078*; long output p=.026, so *)  
  - True: **-0.083***? (true says -0.083*)  
  - Small mismatch.

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.112** (**)  
  - True: **0.140***

  - True: **0.029**
  - Small mismatch.

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **missing / dropped**

  - Small mismatch (but might reflect different race coding scheme).

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated: **0.091*** (p=.017, *)  
  - True: **0.059** (no star)
  - **Mismatch in magnitude and inference**.

  - Generated: **N=738, R²=0.127, Adj R²=0.115**
  - True: **N=756, R²=0.151, Adj R²=0.139**
  - **Mismatch** (again suggests you are not using the same sample and/or not using weights if the original did).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.149***? (p=.012, so *)  
  - True: **-0.151** (**)  
  - Close magnitude, **different significance**.

- **Income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.016**
  - True: **-0.009**

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.048** (ns)
  - True: **0.110*** (*)
  - **Large mismatch**.
  - **Fix:** major sample/measurement/standardization differences; also your Model 3 N is far smaller (417 vs 503), which will distort estimates.

- **Black**
  - Generated: **0.057**
  - True: **0.049**
  - Close.

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **missing / dropped**
  - True: **0.031**

- **Political intolerance**
  - Generated: **0.176***  
  - True: **0.164***  
  - Mismatch in magnitude (though same sign and significance).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **7.164**
  - True: **6.516**
  - Mismatch.

- **Fit / N**
  - Generated: **N=417, R²=0.130, Adj R²=0.106**
  - True: **N=503, R²=0.169, Adj R²=0.148**
  - **Mismatch** (large).

## 3) Standard errors: generated output prints them; true table does not

- **Generated table1_style** shows a second line under each coefficient that appears to be a **standard error** (e.g., educ SE = 0.038 in Model 1).
- **True:** explicitly states the PDF table **does not print standard errors**, only standardized coefficients.

**Mismatch**
- You cannot claim your SEs “match” the true table because the true table contains no SEs to compare to.

**Fix**
- Remove SEs from the comparison table (or move them to a separate “replication output” table).
- If you want to validate SEs, you must use another source: appendix, replication files, or re-estimate from the original data with the same design (including weights/cluster corrections if applicable).

---

## 4) Interpretation / inference mismatches (stars, p-values)

Even where coefficients are close, your **significance markers** often differ from the printed table (e.g., Age and Southern in Models 2–3; Education in Model 3).

**Most likely causes**
1. **Different N (listwise deletion differences)**: your N is consistently smaller.
2. **Weights/design effects**: the published table may use survey weights and/or robust SEs; you appear to use plain OLS SEs.
3. **Different variable construction** (religion, region, intolerance scale, Hispanic).
4. **Different standardization approach**.

**Fix**
- Match the original estimation protocol:
  - apply the same **sample restrictions**,
  - apply the same **survey weights** (if used),
  - use the same **SE estimator** (robust, clustered, survey-linearized),
  - rebuild all derived variables identically.

---

## 5) The biggest concrete “how to fix so it matches” checklist

1. **Recreate `hispanic` correctly** (it must be observed, not all-missing).  
2. **Replicate the analytic sample** used in the paper (your N should be 787 / 756 / 503).  
3. **Apply weighting / design-based SEs** if the paper did (this can change stars and sometimes coefficients if weighted).  
4. **Verify constructions** for:
   - income per capita (`income_pc`),
   - occupational prestige (`prestg80` handling of special missing codes),
   - conservative Protestant classification,
   - “Southern” coding,
   - political intolerance scale construction and missing codes.
5. **Standardize exactly as the paper does**, within each model’s estimation sample.

If you share the code you used to construct `income_pc`, `hispanic`, `conservative_protestant`, `southern`, and `political_intolerance` (and whether you used weights/robust SEs), I can pinpoint which step(s) produce the N drop and the coefficient/significance divergences.
