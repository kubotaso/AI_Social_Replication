============================================================

Below is a complete mismatch audit between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, covering **variable names/presence, coefficients (β), standard errors/reporting, model fit (R²/Adj R²), N, and interpretation/significance**—plus concrete fixes to make the generated output match Table 1.

---

## 1) Core reporting mismatch: generated output mixes unstandardized b with standardized β, and adds SE/p-values that Table 1 does not report

### What the True Results are
- Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors.
- **Constants are unstandardized**.
- **Standard errors are not reported** (only stars).

### What the Generated Results do
- They show both **b** and **beta**, plus **p-values** and sometimes treat “value” as β.
- That’s already incompatible with “extract exactly as shown” from the paper, because the paper does **not** provide b, SE, or p.

### Fix
- For a Table-1 replication, **drop b, SE, p-values entirely** and present:
  - standardized β for all predictors
  - unstandardized constant
  - model N, R², Adj R²
  - stars to match the table  
- If you *do* compute p-values from raw data, label the table “re-estimated from data,” not “extracted.”

## 2) Sample size (N) mismatches in all three models

### Model 1 N
- **Generated:** n = **747**
- **True:** n = **787**
- **Mismatch:** -40 cases

**Fix:** Use the same inclusion rule as the paper: listwise deletion on **only** Model 1 variables (educ, income pc, prestige, DV). Your missingness table suggests many more nonmissing than 787, so the drop is likely from:
- applying extra filters (e.g., restricting to those with later-wave items), or
- accidentally requiring nonmissing on variables not in Model 1 (like pol_intol, race, etc.)

### Model 2 N
- **Generated:** n = **507**
- **True:** n = **756**
- **Mismatch:** huge (-249)

**Fix:** You are almost certainly doing listwise deletion using variables that are *not supposed to be required* for Model 2 (very likely `pol_intol`, since it has ~47% missing). Ensure Model 2’s estimation dataset only requires nonmissing on the DV + Model 2 predictors.

### Model 3 N
- **Generated:** n = **286**
- **True:** n = **503**
- **Mismatch:** huge (-217)

**Fix:** Even for Model 3, your N is too small. Likely causes:
- you required nonmissing on **additional** variables not in the model (e.g., `hispanic` missingness is ~35% in your table; if “Hispanic” is coded in a way that induces missing and you do listwise deletion, N will collapse).
- you constructed race dummies incorrectly (see “Other race dropped” below) which can induce NA/collinearity handling that reduces effective N.

---

## 3) Fit statistics (R², Adj R²) mismatch in all models

### Model 1
- **Generated:** R² = **0.088**, Adj R² = **0.085**
- **True:** R² = **0.107**, Adj R² = **0.104**

### Model 2
- **Generated:** R² = **0.135**, Adj R² = **0.118**
- **True:** R² = **0.151**, Adj R² = **0.139**

### Model 3
- **Generated:** R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.111**
- **True:** R² = **0.169**, Adj R² = **0.148**

**Fix:** Once N and variable coding match the paper, R² should move closer. Right now the differences are consistent with:
- wrong estimation sample (most important),
- mis-coded predictors (race, Hispanic, Southern, age),
- wrong DV (ensure “Number of music genres disliked” is the exact measure and coding used in paper).

---

## 4) Predictor set mismatch: “Other race” is missing/dropped in generated models

### Evidence
- Generated fit_stats show `dropped_predictors = otherrace` in Models 2 and 3.
- In model tables, “Other race” is **NaN**.

### True Results
- “Other race” is **included** and has β:
  - Model 2: **0.005**
  - Model 3: **0.053**

### Fix
This is a *structural* coding/collinearity problem. Typical causes:
1. **Perfect multicollinearity** from race dummy coding:
   - If you include dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race **and** also have White as implicit plus an intercept, that’s usually fine **if exactly one category is the reference**.
   - But if your dummies sum to 1 *and* you also included a “white” dummy (or used all categories), you get the dummy trap.
2. **Other race has zero variance** in the estimation sample (unlikely with n=507, but possible if you filtered incorrectly).
3. “Hispanic” is not a race dummy but an ethnicity overlapping with race dummies; if you coded it inconsistently, you can create near-dependence patterns.

Concrete fix steps:
- Create a single race categorical variable with levels, then set contrasts with one reference (e.g., White reference):
  - Include dummies for **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race**, omit White (reference).
- Verify `var(otherrace) > 0` in the model dataset.
- Ensure you are not also including a “white” dummy (or all race categories).

## 5) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model and variable

Below I compare the **standardized coefficients (β)** (since that’s what Table 1 reports). I ignore your unstandardized b because the paper doesn’t report them.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | **-0.292** | **-0.322** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | slightly high |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | low |
| R² | **0.088** | **0.107** | low |
| N | **747** | **787** | low |

**Fix:** primarily sample mismatch + possibly education coding (years vs degree categories). Ensure education is exactly the paper’s “Education (years)” and the same age range/sample restrictions.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | **-0.264** | **-0.246** | too negative |
| Income pc | **-0.053** | **-0.054** | close |
| Prestige | **-0.016** | **-0.006** | too negative |
| Female | **-0.090*** | **-0.083*** | somewhat more negative |
| Age | **0.104*** | **0.140*** | substantially too small |
| Black | **0.043** | **0.029** | higher |
| Hispanic | **0.030** | **-0.029** | **wrong sign** |
| Other race | **(dropped/NA)** | **0.005** | missing |
| Cons Prot | **0.090** | **0.059** | too high |
| No religion | **-0.019** | **-0.012** | slightly too negative |
| Southern | **0.063** | **0.097** | too small |
| Constant | **9.285** | **8.507** | too high |
| R² | **0.135** | **0.151** | low |
| N | **507** | **756** | far too low |

Key substantive errors:
- **Hispanic sign error** (generated +0.030 vs true −0.029)
- **Other race missing**
- **Age effect too small**
- **Southern too small**
- Constant off

**Fixes:**
1. **Fix the estimation sample** (stop listwise-deleting on `pol_intol` for Model 2).
2. **Fix Hispanic coding**:
   - In your missingness table, `hispanic` has 35% missing—this is suspicious for a simple ethnicity dummy. In many datasets, Hispanic is derived from multiple items or asked only of subsets. The paper likely has a clean coding.
   - Recode Hispanic as a 0/1 indicator with missing handled exactly as in paper (often missing recoded to 0 is *wrong*, and dropping all missing may be *overly strict* if paper uses a constructed variable).
3. **Fix Other race inclusion** (dummy coding/collinearity as above).
4. Verify **Age scaling** (years vs categories; also check if you accidentally used `age_v` but excluded older/younger cases).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | **-0.157** | **-0.151** | close (but stars differ) |
| Income pc | **-0.050** | **-0.009** | **much too negative** |
| Prestige | **-0.011** | **-0.022** | too small magnitude |
| Female | **-0.122*** | **-0.095*** | too negative |
| Age | **0.083 (ns)** | **0.110*** | too small + wrong significance |
| Black | **0.107** | **0.049** | too high |
| Hispanic | **0.028** | **0.031** | close |
| Other race | **(dropped/NA)** | **0.053** | missing |
| Cons Prot | **0.037** | **0.066** | too small |
| No religion | **0.024** | **0.024** | matches |
| Southern | **0.065** | **0.121** | much too small |
| Political intolerance | **0.190** | **0.164** | too high |
| Constant | **7.360** | **6.516** | too high |
| R² | **0.145** | **0.169** | low |
| N | **286** | **503** | far too low |

Major issues:
- **Income effect is wildly off** (−0.050 vs −0.009).
- **Southern much too small**.
- **Age too small and loses significance**.
- **Other race missing**.
- **Political intolerance too large**.
- **N is drastically too low**, which will distort everything.

**Fixes:**
1. Rebuild the Model 3 dataset with listwise deletion on only Model 3 vars + DV (not extra constraints).
2. Recheck **income per capita construction**:
   - You label it “(thousands, per capita)”—if you transformed/scaled differently than the paper, standardized β can still change because scaling affects correlations if you also did nonlinear transformations (e.g., logging, top-coding, trimming).
   - Ensure the same handling of zero/negative/missing income and the same equivalence scale (if any).
3. Fix race dummies (Other race inclusion).
4. Align the political intolerance scale to exactly “0–15” with same item composition and missing handling as the paper.

## 6) Significance-star mismatches

Even where β is close, stars don’t match in places. Examples:
- Model 3 Education: generated `*` but true is `**`
- Model 3 Political intolerance: generated `**` but true is `***`
- Model 3 Age: generated ns but true `*`
- Model 2 Age: generated `*` but true `***`
- Model 2 Southern: generated ns but true `**`

**Fix:** Stars in the paper come from the paper’s estimation (with their N, coding, possibly weights/design corrections). You cannot match stars unless:
- you replicate **the same sample**, **coding**, and **estimation choices** (weights? robust SE?).
- But since Table 1 doesn’t report SE, your computed p-values may still differ even if β matches moderately.

If your goal is to match Table 1 exactly, **do not compute stars from your re-estimation**; instead, **copy the stars as shown** in Table 1.

---

## 7) Interpretation/labeling mismatches

### DV labeling
- True: “Number of Music Genres Disliked”
- Generated uses `num_genres_disliked` (fine), but ensure it’s exactly the same constructed DV (range, missing codes, exclusions).

### Political intolerance
- Generated: “Political intolerance (0–15)” (matches label)
- But the β and stars differ; likely scale construction or sample mismatch.

**Fix:** document construction and ensure item coding and missing-data rules match the paper.

## 8) Practical checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Recreate each model’s analysis dataset separately**:
   - Model 1: DV + educ + inc_pc + prestige only.
   - Model 2: Model 1 vars + female + age + race dummies + religion dummies + south.
   - Model 3: Model 2 vars + pol_intol.
2. **Do not drop cases based on variables not in that model.**
3. **Fix race coding so “Other race” is estimable** (no collinearity; sufficient variance).
4. **Standardize predictors to get β** exactly as paper (or compute standardized coefficients as in the paper’s software). Confirm whether β refers to:
   - fully standardized (DV and X standardized) or
   - partially standardized (only X standardized).  
   In OLS, “standardized coefficients” typically mean fully standardized; implement accordingly.
5. **Present results in the same format**:
   - β only for predictors,
   - constant unstandardized,
   - no SE column,
   - copy stars per table if you are “extracting,” not re-estimating.
6. **Confirm weights/design**:
   - If the paper uses GSS weights, apply the same weight variable.
   - If design-based SE were used, it affects stars (though Table 1 doesn’t show SE).

If you share your code (or at least how each variable was coded and how the sample was filtered), I can pinpoint the exact line(s) causing (a) the N collapse and (b) the “Other race” dropping and (c) the Hispanic sign flip.
