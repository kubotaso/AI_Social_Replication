Below is a line-by-line audit of **everything that does not match** between the Generated Results and the True (PDF Table 1) results, plus what you need to change so the generated analysis reproduces the printed table.

---

## 1) Core mismatch: **unstandardized vs standardized coefficients**

### What the True table reports
- The PDF Table 1 reports **standardized OLS coefficients (beta weights)**.
- It explicitly **does not print standard errors**.

### What the generated table reports
- Your generated coefficients (e.g., **educ = -1.167**) are clearly **unstandardized** (raw units: “genres disliked per year of education”), not standardized.
- You also print SE-looking numbers under coefficients (e.g., **0.109, 0.157, 0.151**) but those do not correspond to the PDF table (because the PDF does not provide SEs).

### Fix
To match Table 1, you must estimate/print **standardized betas**, not raw coefficients. Do one of:

**Option A (recommended): standardize variables then regress**
- Standardize **DV and all continuous predictors** used for the reported betas.
- For binary predictors (female, black, etc.), do *not* z-score them if the original authors didn’t; but the printed table *is* “standardized coefficients,” which typically means **all predictors** are standardized (some authors still leave dummies unstandardized). You must replicate the authors’ exact convention—Table 1 strongly suggests full standardization because all coefficients are in similar small ranges.

**Option B: compute beta from raw regression**
For each predictor \(X_j\):
\[
\beta_j^{std} = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
\]
Then print \(\beta_j^{std}\).

Also: **remove standard errors from the output** (or clearly label them as “not in PDF; computed from replication”), because otherwise you are claiming agreement with information that the “true” table does not contain.

## 2) Variable-name mismatches (minor, but must align)

The generated variable names differ from the PDF labels. This doesn’t change estimates but *does* violate “match variable names.”

| True Table name | Generated term | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Education | `educ` | label mismatch | rename in table output to “Education” |
| Household income per capita | `income_pc` | label mismatch | rename to “Household income per capita” |
| Occupational prestige | `prestg80` | label mismatch | rename to “Occupational prestige” |
| Conservative Protestant | `conservative_protestant` | label mismatch | rename |
| No religion | `no_religion` | label mismatch | rename |
| Political intolerance | `political_intolerance` | label mismatch | rename DV/IV labels to match PDF |

---

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (every coefficient differs)

Because you used unstandardized coefficients, **none of the reported betas match the PDF**. Below are the mismatches term-by-term.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -1.167*** | -0.322*** | scale/standardization wrong |
| Household income per capita | -0.119 | -0.037 | scale/standardization wrong |
| Occupational prestige | 0.103 | 0.016 | scale/standardization wrong |
| Constant | 5.590 | 10.920 | additionally indicates DV scaling/sample differences |

**Fix:** standardized betas + correct sample (see Section 6).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -1.058*** | -0.246*** | wrong scale |
| HH income pc | -0.198 | -0.054 | wrong scale |
| Occ prestige | -0.026 | -0.006 | wrong scale |
| Female | -0.272 | -0.083* | wrong scale + significance mismatch |
| Age | 0.382* | 0.140*** | wrong scale + star level mismatch |
| Black | 0.185 | 0.029 | wrong scale |
| Hispanic | -0.060 | -0.029 | wrong scale |
| Other race | -0.056 | 0.005 | wrong sign (and scale) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.140 | 0.059 | wrong scale |
| No religion | -0.057 | -0.012 | wrong scale |
| Southern | 0.276 | 0.097** | wrong scale + star mismatch |
| Constant | 5.677 | 8.507 | DV/sample discrepancy too |

**Fix:** standardized betas + correct coding of race dummies and sample.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.520* | -0.151** | wrong scale + star mismatch |
| HH income pc | -0.231 | -0.009 | wrong scale |
| Occ prestige | 0.017 | -0.022 | sign mismatch |
| Female | -0.400* | -0.095* | wrong scale |
| Age | 0.315 | 0.110* | wrong scale + significance mismatch |
| Black | 0.222 | 0.049 | wrong scale |
| Hispanic | 0.055 | 0.031 | wrong scale |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | **matches numerically** but likely coincidental because other terms don’t |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.015 | 0.066 | wrong scale |
| No religion | 0.028 | 0.024 | close but still off |
| Southern | 0.271 | 0.121** | wrong scale + stars |
| Political intolerance | 0.726*** | 0.164*** | wrong scale (major) |
| Constant | 5.601 | 6.516 | mismatch |

**Fix:** standardized betas; ensure political intolerance index is constructed the same way as the authors and the same inclusion rule is applied (see Section 7).

## 4) Standard errors: generated output conflicts with the “true” table

### True
- **No SEs are printed.** Any SE comparison is impossible from Table 1 alone.

### Generated
- The table shows a second line under each coefficient (looks like SEs), but:
  - they are not labeled as SEs,
  - they cannot be validated against the PDF,
  - and the presence of SE lines contradicts “match the printed table.”

### Fix
- If your goal is **match Table 1 exactly**, do **not print SEs at all**.
- If your goal is replication plus extra info, label them clearly, e.g. “(robust SE)”—but then you are no longer matching the PDF output.

## 5) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj R²)

| Model | Generated R² | True R² | Generated Adj R² | True Adj R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| M1 | 0.1088 | 0.107 | 0.1052 | 0.104 |
| M2 | 0.1572 | 0.151 | 0.1391 | 0.139 |
| M3 | 0.1511 | 0.169 | 0.1210 | 0.148 |

Observations:
- M1 is close (likely rounding + sample differences), but not exact.
- M2: R² is too high in generated.
- M3: R² is *much* lower in generated, and Adj R² is far off.

### Fix
R² differences usually come from **different samples**, **different variable construction**, and/or **different inclusion rules** (see Sections 6–7). Standardization by itself won’t fix R².

---

## 6) Sample size mismatches (major)

True Ns:
- Model 1: **787**
- Model 2: **756**
- Model 3: **503**

Generated Ns:
- Model 1: **758**
- Model 2: **523**
- Model 3: **351**

These are not minor discrepancies—your generated models are estimated on **much smaller and inconsistent** subsets.

### Likely causes (supported by your own missingness tables)
- You have **281 missing** on `hispanic` (huge). In the PDF, Model 2 uses N=756, so `hispanic` cannot be missing for ~31% if they got 756 cases.
  - This strongly suggests your `hispanic` variable is being treated as missing when it should be coded **0/1** (e.g., NA meaning “not Hispanic” is incorrectly left as NA).
- You have **302 missing** on political intolerance and then impose a rule requiring “min answered = 10,” shrinking to N=351.

### Fixes
1) **Recode ethnicity/race variables to avoid structural missingness**
   - If `hispanic` is derived from a multi-category race/ethnicity item, you must create:
     - `hispanic = 1` if Hispanic, else `0` (not NA)
   - Same for `black`, `other_race`, etc. Ensure exactly one of the mutually exclusive categories is 1 (or use a categorical factor with a reference group).

2) **Match the authors’ case selection**
   - Restrict to the same survey year/sample as the paper (you show `N_year_1993=1606`, so likely correct year, but you also filter on “complete music 18” and maybe additional filters not used by authors).
   - Use the same “valid response” criteria for the DV and indices.

3) **Use consistent listwise deletion rules per model**
   - The authors’ Ns imply much less missingness than your constructed variables currently create.

---

## 7) Political intolerance construction/rule mismatch (very likely)

Your diagnostics show:
- `polintol_min_answered_rule = 10`
- `polintol_items_answered_min = 0`, max 15, mean 9.77
- Resulting Model 3 N collapses to 351.

But the true Model 3 N is **503**—so the paper either:
- uses a different inclusion threshold (e.g., allow fewer items),
- uses a different imputation/averaging rule (e.g., mean of answered items if ≥ some smaller number),
- uses a different set of items,
- or uses a precomputed scale with fewer missing values.

Also, the generated coefficient for political intolerance (0.726) vs true (0.164) screams “different scaling.” You might be using a **sum** 0–15, while the authors standardized (or used an average 0–1 / 0–something).

### Fix
- Reconstruct `political_intolerance` exactly as in the paper:
  - same items,
  - same coding direction,
  - same aggregation (sum vs mean),
  - same missing-data rule.
- Then **standardize** it (since Table 1 reports standardized betas).
- Adjust the minimum-answered rule to reproduce N≈503.

---

## 8) Interpretation/significance-star mismatches

Because the coefficients (and sometimes p-values) don’t match, the **star patterns** differ too:

Examples:
- Model 2 `age`: generated `0.382*` but true `0.140***`.
- Model 2 `southern`: generated no stars (p≈.061) but true `0.097**`.
- Model 3 `educ`: generated `*` but true `**`.

### Fix
Once you:
1) correct the sample,
2) correct variable construction/coding,
3) compute standardized betas the same way,
the p-values/stars should align much more closely. If they still don’t, check:
- whether the paper uses **two-tailed** tests (it says it does),
- whether you used **robust vs conventional** SEs (stars depend on this),
- whether you applied **weights** (often critical in survey data; not shown in your output but common in GSS-style analyses).

---

## 9) Constants don’t match (and shouldn’t if standardized)

True constants: 10.920, 8.507, 6.516  
Generated constants: 5.590, 5.677, 5.601

If the authors ran models on the raw DV, constants should be near the mean of the DV conditional on predictors’ means. Your constants being much lower suggests:
- DV coding differs, or
- sample composition differs, or
- predictors are centered/standardized differently.

### Fix
- Verify DV construction: “Number of music genres disliked” must match the paper’s exact count rule (which genres, how “dislike” is defined, how DK/NA handled).
- Match the sample selection.
- If you decide to print a standardized-coefficient table, note that constants in standardized regressions are often 0 (if DV standardized) and typically not compared to the PDF (since the PDF’s constant is for the unstandardized DV).

## What you should do to make the generated analysis match Table 1 (minimal checklist)

1) **Recreate the exact analysis sample** used in the paper (Ns must match 787/756/503).
2) **Fix dummy coding**, especially `hispanic` (do not leave non-Hispanic as missing).
3) **Reconstruct political intolerance** to match the paper (items, scaling, missingness rule) to recover N≈503 and the correct effect size.
4) **Report standardized coefficients** (beta weights) to match the PDF.
5) **Do not print SEs** if the goal is to match the printed Table 1; or clearly separate “replication extras” from “as printed.”
6) Confirm whether the paper used **weights**; if yes, replicate weighted OLS.

If you share (a) the code you used to build `num_genres_disliked` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) how `hispanic` is coded in the raw data, I can pinpoint the exact recode causing the N drop and the political intolerance scaling mismatch.
