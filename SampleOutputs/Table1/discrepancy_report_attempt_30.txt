## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (n, R², adj. R², dropped terms)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **n (cases)**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s. Align the sample restrictions and missing-data handling with the paper. Most likely you used **listwise deletion on variables not in Model 1** (or you filtered to respondents with DV observed but also applied extra missingness rules). Recompute Model 1 using *only* DV + Model 1 predictors (educ, inc_pc, prestg80) for listwise deletion.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.088 / 0.085**
  - True: **0.107 / 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample matches (n=787) and variables/coding match, R² should move toward the published values. If it still doesn’t, the remaining usual causes are:
    - different variable coding (e.g., income scaling, education coding, prestige year/version)
    - applying weights vs unweighted (paper likely uses GSS weights or a specific one—must match)
    - standardization/centering differences don’t change R², but **case selection and coding do**.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **n**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** Massive discrepancy indicates you’re dropping far more observations than the paper. The biggest red flag is your `missingness` table: **DV has 44% missing**, but in the paper Model 2 still has 756 cases (so DV can’t be missing that much under the paper’s construction/sample).
  - This strongly suggests your DV (`num_genres_disliked`) is constructed differently (see Section 4).

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.135 / 0.118**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Match the DV and sample first; then confirm the “Southern” and age effects (and other race) are being estimated (you dropped “Other race” entirely—see below).

- **Dropped**
  - Generated: **otherrace dropped**
  - True: **otherrace included with β = 0.005**
  - **Fix:** “Other race” should not be dropped. It’s being dropped due to **no variation in the estimation sample** or **perfect multicollinearity** (often caused by including all race dummies plus an intercept, or by subsetting to a sample where “other race” never occurs).
  - Implement race as **k−1 dummies with a clear reference category** (e.g., White omitted), and don’t accidentally include both a “white” dummy and intercept. Also ensure your subsetting isn’t excluding “otherrace” respondents.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **n**
  - Generated: **334**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Again points to (a) DV mismatch and/or (b) requiring nonmissing on too many items. Model 3 should listwise-delete on DV + all Model 3 predictors only.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.136 / 0.106**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Mostly downstream of sample/DV mismatch plus the incorrect income/prestige effects (see below).

---

## 2) Variable name / inclusion mismatches

### Political intolerance variable name
- Generated uses **`pol_intol`** in missingness/descriptives and labels “Political intolerance” in models.
- True table calls it **Political intolerance** (conceptually same).
- **Fix:** Naming is fine; the issue is likely **construction/scaling** (see coefficient mismatch below).

### “Other race” handling
- Generated: **Other race = NaN** (dropped) in Models 2 and 3
- True: included with nonzero β in Models 2 and 3 (0.005; 0.053)
- **Fix:** As above—ensure correct dummy coding and sufficient cases; do not subset in a way that eliminates this category.

---

## 3) Coefficient / sign / significance mismatches (Table 1 standardized betas)

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except constants). Your “Table1style” outputs are β-like, so compare those.

### Model 1 (SES): β mismatches
- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.292***  
  - True β: **-0.322***  
  - **Fix:** sample/coding mismatch. Education’s effect is weaker in your data; align:
    - education coding (years vs degree categories)
    - sample (n should be 787)
    - any weighting

- **Income per capita**
  - Generated β: **-0.039**
  - True β: **-0.037**
  - Close; likely resolves with sample alignment.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **0.020**
  - True β: **0.016**
  - Close; likely resolves with sample alignment.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.638**
  - True: **10.920**
  - **Fix:** constants are **unstandardized** in the paper; differences reflect different sample mean of DV and/or different coding of predictors (and possibly different DV). If you correct DV construction and sample, constant should move.

### Model 2 (Demographic): β mismatches
- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.264*** vs True **-0.246*** (moderate mismatch)

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.104***? (you mark `*` only; in full model p=0.0176 so *)  
  - True: **0.140***  
  - **Mismatch in magnitude and significance.**
  - **Fix:** age effect is too small and underpowered in your model due to reduced n and/or different age coding (e.g., age top-coding, scaling). Ensure age is in years and sample n≈756.

- **Hispanic sign**
  - Generated: **+0.030**
  - True: **-0.029**
  - **Sign mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** almost certainly a **coding reversal** or different reference category. Check how `hispanic` is defined:
    - Paper likely uses dummy: 1=Hispanic, 0=non-Hispanic.
    - Also ensure race/ethnicity dummies are mutually consistent (e.g., Hispanic not simultaneously treated as race category vs separate ethnicity). If you coded Hispanic as “non-Hispanic”=1, sign flips.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.063 (ns)**  
  - True: **0.097** **(significant, **)**
  - **Fix:** again likely n/DV mismatch. With n=507 you lose power, but your β is also smaller. Ensure south coding matches GSS `south` region definition used in paper and apply same weights/sample.

- **Other race**
  - Generated: blank/dropped
  - True: **0.005**
  - Fix as above.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **9.285**
  - True: **8.507**
  - **Fix:** indicates your DV mean is higher and/or predictors differ; usually DV construction/sample.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): β mismatches (important)
- **Income per capita**
  - Generated β: **-0.065**
  - True β: **-0.009**
  - **Major mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** Your income-per-capita variable (`inc_pc`) is likely constructed/scaled differently than the paper’s (or includes extreme values/winsorization differences), and your reduced n can exacerbate this. Steps:
    1. Confirm formula exactly as in paper (household income / household size? equivalized?).
    2. Use the same income measure year (1993) and same handling of missing/“don’t know/refused”.
    3. Apply the same transformation (paper may use logged income per capita or recoded categories; Table says “Household income per capita” but that can still be transformed).

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **0.009**
  - True β: **-0.022**
  - **Sign mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** prestige variable mismatch (e.g., using `prestg80` but paper may use different prestige scale, or reverse-coded occupational status). Also could be suppression due to incorrect race dummy setup and/or sample distortion, but sign flip suggests coding/variable mismatch.

- **Age**
  - Generated β: **0.072 (ns)**  
  - True β: **0.110* (significant)**
  - **Fix:** sample size and DV mismatch primarily; also check age coding.

- **Southern**
  - Generated β: **0.072 (ns)**  
  - True β: **0.121** **(significant, **)**
  - **Fix:** sample/DV mismatch and/or south coding mismatch.

- **Political intolerance**
  - Generated β: **0.201***  
  - True β: **0.164***  
  - **Mismatch in magnitude.**
  - **Fix:** likely different `pol_intol` scale construction (item selection, coding direction, range), plus smaller n inflating estimates. Rebuild the index exactly as paper: same items, same coding direction, same missing rule (e.g., require at least k of m items), same rescaling.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **7.027**
  - True: **6.516**
  - **Fix:** again consistent with DV differences.

## 4) The biggest underlying problem: DV construction / missingness is incompatible with the “true” n

Your `missingness` shows:

- `num_genres_disliked`: **893 nonmissing out of 1606** (44% missing)

But the paper’s models report:
- Model 1 n=787
- Model 2 n=756
- Model 3 n=503

If only 893 have DV, it is *possible* to get 787/756/503 after listwise deletion, but your Model 2 and 3 n’s (507/334) are far smaller than expected. That implies **additional missingness introduced by your construction of predictors (especially Hispanic and pol_intol)** *and/or* you restricted the sample incorrectly.

**Fix checklist (to force alignment):**
1. **Recreate DV exactly like paper** (which music genres were asked in 1993; how “disliked” is coded; how “not asked/skip patterns” are handled). A common error is treating “not asked” as missing rather than 0 or excluding those respondents incorrectly.
2. For each model, do **listwise deletion using only the variables in that model** (don’t pre-filter on Model 3 variables when fitting Model 1/2).
3. Verify `hispanic` missingness: you show **35% missing**, which is unusually high for a basic demographic indicator—suggesting you derived it from a variable only asked of a subset or misread codes (e.g., 9/0/8 values treated as missing).
4. Verify race/ethnicity coding scheme matches paper (Hispanic sometimes treated as ethnicity, not race; paper includes both black and Hispanic and other race simultaneously, implying a specific scheme).

---

## 5) Standard errors and p-values: interpretation mismatch with “true results”

- True Table 1: **SEs not reported**, only β and significance stars.
- Generated output includes **p-values** and significance stars derived from your model SEs.

This is not a “mismatch” per se, but it *will* mismatch the paper’s stars if:
- your n differs,
- your coding differs,
- you used heteroskedastic-robust SEs vs conventional OLS SEs (paper likely uses conventional unless stated),
- you used weights or clustering.

**Fix:** To match Table 1:
- Report **standardized coefficients (β)** and **stars only** using the same significance thresholds.
- Use the **same SE convention** as the paper (typically conventional OLS SE unless robust is specified).
- Most importantly: **match the estimation sample** first.

---

## 6) Concrete steps to make generated analysis match the true table

1. **Match sample definition (GSS 1993)**
   - Filter to the same year/module and eligible respondents as the paper.
2. **Rebuild variables to match the paper**
   - DV: exact genre list, coding of “dislike,” handling of skips.
   - `inc_pc`: same denominator, same transformation, same missing-code handling.
   - `prestg80`: confirm same prestige scale and direction.
   - `pol_intol`: same items, same index construction, same missing rule, same range.
   - `hispanic`: fix coding so it’s a clean 0/1 with minimal missing (handle DK/NA codes appropriately rather than turning large fractions into missing).
3. **Dummy coding**
   - Race: omit one category (likely White) as reference; include Black, Hispanic, Other race as in paper.
   - Ensure “Other race” has variation and is not collinear.
4. **Model-by-model listwise deletion**
   - Fit Model 1 on (DV, educ, inc_pc, prestg80) only.
   - Fit Model 2 on Model 1 vars + demographics only.
   - Fit Model 3 on Model 2 vars + pol_intol only.
5. **Replicate reporting style**
   - Standardize predictors (or compute standardized coefficients from the fitted model) so β aligns with Table 1.
   - Keep constants unstandardized.
   - Don’t present SEs if your goal is to match Table 1; or, if you do, explicitly label them as “computed, not in paper.”

If you paste your variable construction code (especially DV, inc_pc, hispanic, pol_intol) and your exact subsetting/listwise deletion logic, I can point to the exact line(s) producing the n collapse and the sign flips.
