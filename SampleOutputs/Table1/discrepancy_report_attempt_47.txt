### 1) Table structure / variable-name mismatches (and omissions)

**Mismatch A: Models 2 and 3 are missing entirely in the generated output**
- **Generated:** Model 2 and Model 3 have `N = 0`, all coefficients are `NaN`, and the table prints dashes for every term.
- **True:** Model 2 has **N=756** and Model 3 has **N=503**, with many nonzero standardized coefficients and fit stats.
- **Fix:** Your estimation sample construction is dropping *all* rows for Models 2 and 3. The diagnostics show why: `hispanic` has **0 nonmissing** (893 missing), which forces listwise deletion to remove everyone.

**Mismatch B: `hispanic` variable is incorrectly coded/constructed (critical)**
- **Generated diagnostics:**  
  - `missingness_m2`: `hispanic nonmissing = 0, missing = 893`  
  - `missingness_m3`: same
- **True table:** Hispanic is included and estimated in Models 2 and 3, so it cannot be completely missing.
- **Likely causes:**
  1) You created `hispanic` from the wrong source column (wrong name) so it became all-NA.  
  2) You recoded it with a condition that never triggers (e.g., comparing strings to numbers).  
  3) You merged/subsetted in a way that wiped the column for the 1993/music-complete sample.
- **Fix:** Verify the raw race/ethnicity variable(s) and recreate dummies correctly. Concretely:
  - Check `df['hispanic'].value_counts(dropna=False)` **before** listwise deletion.
  - If the dataset has an ethnicity variable like `hispan`, `hispanic2`, `ethnic`, or a race code where Hispanic is a category, build it from that correct source.
  - Ensure it’s numeric 0/1 (or boolean) and not all missing after filtering to year 1993 and DV-complete.

**Mismatch C: Variable naming differs from “as printed” in the true table (minor but required by your prompt)**
- **Generated term names:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `other_race`, `political_intolerance`
- **True table names:** “Education”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, “Conservative Protestant”, “No religion”, “Other race”, “Political intolerance”
- **Fix:** Either (a) rename variables in the output table to match print labels, or (b) map internal names → printed labels in the table-rendering layer. This doesn’t change estimates, but it fixes “variable name” mismatches.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (Model 1)

All coefficients in the true table are **standardized betas**. Your “coefficients_long” indicates `beta_std`, so you are also reporting standardized betas—but they do not match the printed ones.

**Model 1 (SES) standardized coefficients**
| Term | Generated beta_std | True beta (printed) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.332*** | **-0.322*** | coefficient differs (-0.010) |
| income_pc | **-0.034** (ns) | **-0.037** (ns) | coefficient differs (+0.003) |
| prestg80 | **0.029** (ns) | **0.016** (ns) | coefficient differs (+0.013) |

**Fixes to align Model 1 betas:**
1) **Use the same sample size / listwise-deletion rule as the paper.**  
   - **Generated N:** 758  
   - **True N:** 787  
   Your sample is smaller, meaning your filter/listwise deletion is stricter or variables are coded differently.
   - Fix by replicating the paper’s inclusion rules exactly (especially for income, prestige, education missingness, and the DV construction).
2) **Confirm DV construction matches the paper.**  
   You use `num_genres_disliked` from “complete_music_18”. If the paper defines the DV differently (e.g., different set of genres, different missing handling, or different year subset), standardized betas will shift.
3) **Confirm standardization method matches the paper.**  
   Standardized coefficients from OLS can differ depending on:
   - whether you standardize **using the estimation sample** (typical) vs full sample
   - whether you standardize DV and X manually vs using a package option
   - whether you use **population SD (ddof=0)** vs **sample SD (ddof=1)**  
   These usually cause small differences—like you see for educ/income—but your N mismatch suggests sample differences are the bigger issue.
4) **Weighting/design effects:** If the published results used survey weights and you did not, coefficients (and R², constants) can differ. (You didn’t show weights usage.)
   - Fix: apply the same weights and (if applicable) design-based SEs. Even though SEs aren’t printed, betas and constants can still change under weighting.

### 3) Fit statistics mismatches (Model 1)

| Stat | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Constant | 11.086 | 10.920 | differs |
| R² | 0.10877 | 0.107 | differs |
| Adj R² | 0.105224 | 0.104 | differs |
| N | 758 | 787 | differs |

**Fix:** Same root causes as above (sample construction, DV definition, standardization, weights). The **constant** difference strongly indicates either (a) sample difference, (b) DV difference, or (c) model specification not identical.

---

### 4) Coefficient/fit mismatches (Models 2 and 3)

**Generated:** cannot compare coefficients because they are missing (`NaN`) due to `N=0`.  
**True:** Models 2 and 3 have many nonzero coefficients, R², adjusted R², and constants.

**Fix:** After repairing `hispanic` (and any other all-missing variable), rerun Models 2 and 3 with correct listwise deletion. Your diagnostics also show:
- Political intolerance nonmissing in DV-complete is 491, but the true Model 3 N is 503. That suggests **your political intolerance variable or DV-complete filter is not matching the paper** (or the paper uses different missing-data handling). You need to reconcile that too.

Concretely:
- Rebuild `political_intolerance` exactly as the paper defines it (item set, coding direction, scale construction, and missing rules).
- Ensure you’re using the same base sample for Model 3 as the paper (paper: 503 cases, you: at most 491 even before adding other covariates).

---

### 5) Standard errors + interpretation mismatches

**Mismatch: Generated table implies SEs exist (but doesn’t show them clearly); true table explicitly says SEs are not printed.**
- **Generated:** The “table1_style” shows a second numeric line under the coefficient (e.g., `-0.332***` then `-0.034` then `0.029` then later `0.109`, `0.105`) but it’s not labeled; it looks like you attempted to print SEs or additional stats.
- **True:** Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only**; SEs are not available from that table.
- **Fix:**
  - If your goal is to match the PDF Table 1: **remove SE rows entirely** and print only standardized betas with stars, plus constants/R²/AdjR²/N.
  - If your goal is to compute SEs anyway: do it, but you must **not claim they came from Table 1**, and you should label them properly. Also, SEs would be for *unstandardized* coefficients unless you explicitly compute SEs for standardized betas (nontrivial and not what most packages print by default).

**Interpretation mismatch risk: “significance stars”**
- **Generated:** educ has `***` with p≈1.77e-15, fine.
- **True:** stars correspond to two-tailed thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001).  
- **Fix:** ensure your star function uses the same thresholds and two-tailed p-values. This is minor compared to the missing-model problem.

### 6) Summary of what to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1) **Fix the `hispanic` variable (currently all missing).** This is the blocking error causing Model 2/3 to collapse to N=0.
2) **Replicate the paper’s sample selection to get N = 787 / 756 / 503.**  
   - Your Model 1 N is 758 (too low).  
   - Your political intolerance nonmissing count suggests Model 3 can’t reach 503 as currently built.
3) **Verify DV construction exactly matches “Number of music genres disliked” in the paper.** Ensure same genre list and missing-data rules.
4) **Match the paper’s modeling approach:** check for survey weights and any exclusions (e.g., age restrictions, valid-response screens).
5) **Match the output format:** standardized betas only (no SEs) if you are reproducing Table 1 from the PDF; rename variables to printed labels.

If you share the code (or at least the raw column names for race/ethnicity and political intolerance), I can point to the exact line(s) that are producing `hispanic = NA` and the exact change needed to recover Models 2 and 3 with nonzero N.
