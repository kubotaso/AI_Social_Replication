============================================================

Below I compare your **Generated Results** to the **True Results (Table 1 in the paper)**. The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β) only** (plus stars), **no standard errors**, and **unstandardized constants**. So the relevant target for matching is: **βs, stars, constants, R²/Adj. R², and N**.

---

## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (N, R², Adjusted R², dropped vars)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - Fix: your analytic dataset is being reduced too much. Ensure you are using the same missing-data rule as the paper (likely listwise on *only* Model 1 variables + outcome). Recompute Model 1 on the correct sample.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, **Adj R² = 0.085**
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, **Adj R² = 0.104**
  - Fix: once the sample matches (N=787) and variables are coded identically, these should move toward the published values. Also verify you are using OLS with the same weights (if any) as the paper.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - Fix: you are dropping far more cases than the paper. This usually comes from (a) inadvertently requiring non-missing on variables not in the model, (b) using a recode that creates many NAs, or (c) merging data incorrectly. Build the model-2 analysis frame using only outcome + Model 2 predictors.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.138 / 0.119**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - Fix: likely resolves after sample/coding fixes; also check region/race/religion dummy construction.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **334**
  - True: **503**
  - Fix: same issue—your “Model 3 frame” is too restrictive. Use listwise deletion on only the Model 3 variables (outcome + predictors), not on extra variables.

- **Dropped**
  - Generated fit_stats says: **dropped hispanic**
  - True: Hispanic is included with **β = 0.031**.
  - Fix: don’t drop Hispanic. It’s being lost because in your Model 3 results it is **all NA** (see §3).

---

## 2) Variable-name mismatches (Generated output vs “true” variable list)

These aren’t fatal if you map them correctly, but they indicate your pipeline is mixing **display labels** and **actual variable names**:

- Outcome in missingness: `num_genres_disliked` (ok)
- Political intolerance in missingness: `pol_intol`, but in Model 3 table it’s labeled **Political intolerance**
- Hispanic in missingness: `hispanic`, but it becomes **NaN** in Model 3

**Fix:** create a single consistent mapping layer:
- internal variable names used in regression (e.g., `pol_intol`, `hispanic`, `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`)
- human-readable labels only for presentation

Do not “rename” midstream in a way that changes the object the model uses.

---

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model (and how to fix)

### Model 1 βs
True vs Generated (Table1-style uses β; that’s the right quantity to compare)

- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.292***  
  - True: **-0.322***  
  - Fix: ensure the education variable is coded identically (years vs categories), and sample N matches. If education was top-coded or recoded differently, β will shift.

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.039**
  - True: **-0.037**
  - Small mismatch; likely sample/coding.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **0.020**
  - True: **0.016**
  - Small mismatch; likely sample/coding.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.638**
  - True: **10.920**
  - Fix: constants are sensitive to sample and to how predictors are coded/centered. If you standardized/centered anything before running the model, your intercept won’t match the paper. For Table 1 replication: run OLS on raw predictors (as coded in paper) and then compute standardized β for slopes only.

### Model 2 βs and stars
Key mismatches:

- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.266*** vs True **-0.246*** (moderate mismatch)
- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.102***? (shown as 0.102* in your table) vs True **0.140***  
  - Also **significance mismatch**: True is ***; Generated is only *.
  - Fix: check age coding (years vs categories, or age restricted), and sample size. With N=507 you have less power, which can change stars.

- **Other race**
  - Generated: **-0.027** vs True **0.005**
  - Sign mismatch.
  - Fix: your “Other race” dummy is likely not constructed the same way. In the paper, race dummies are typically mutually exclusive with White as reference. Verify:
    - `black==1` implies not other/hispanic
    - `hispanic==1` separate category
    - “other race” excludes Black and Hispanic
  If you coded “other race” as “not white and not black” (thereby including Hispanic), coefficients will be wrong.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.060 (ns)** vs True **0.097** **(significant, **)**
  - Fix: region variable probably miscoded (e.g., using a “South” indicator that doesn’t match GSS’s region definition, or treating missing as 0). Also power loss from N=507 contributes.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **9.663** vs True **8.507**
  - Fix: again points to coding/sample differences; also indicates your covariate coding (especially race/religion/region) isn’t aligned with the paper.

### Model 3 βs and inclusion
Major problems:

- **Hispanic is missing entirely**
  - Generated: blank/NA
  - True: **β = 0.031**
  - Fix: your `hispanic` variable is becoming all missing in the Model 3 frame (or perfectly collinear and dropped). Given your missingness table shows **34.99% missing** on `hispanic`, you may be converting nonresponse to NA incorrectly, or filtering to a subset where Hispanic is always NA. Also check you didn’t accidentally overwrite `hispanic` during recoding.

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.064** vs True: **-0.009**
  - Large mismatch.
  - Fix: you are not using the same income measure/coding as the paper, or you’re standardizing incorrectly. The paper uses “household income per capita” (likely constructed from household income and household size). Verify construction and confirm it matches the paper’s method and handling of missing/topcodes.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **0.008** vs True: **-0.022**
  - Sign mismatch.
  - Fix: prestige variable may be reversed, scaled differently, or you have a different prestige measure. Confirm you’re using the same GSS prestige variable/year-specific coding.

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.078 (ns)** vs True: **0.110* (significant)**
  - Fix: sample N too low + possible coding mismatch.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.070 (ns)** vs True: **0.121** **(significant, **)**
  - Fix: region coding + N.

- **Political intolerance**
  - Generated: **0.199*** vs True: **0.164***  
  - Direction and significance match, magnitude differs.
  - Fix: your intolerance scale is likely computed differently (different items, different scaling, or handling of “don’t know”).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **7.101** vs True: **6.516**
  - Fix: again, sample/coding and whether anything was centered/standardized before estimation.

## 4) Standard errors: cannot “match” Table 1 (but your output implies they exist)

Your generated model tables show **b, beta, p, sig** but not SEs; however your instruction asks to compare SEs. The true table **does not report SEs**, so any SE comparison is impossible against Table 1.

**Fix:** if the goal is to replicate Table 1, **do not present SEs as if they are in the paper**, and don’t claim mismatches on SE. If you want to provide SEs anyway, label them as “computed from replication data (not in paper)”.

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance-star mismatches

Because your Ns are far smaller, your p-values/stars will often differ.

Concrete mismatches:
- **Model 2 Age**: True ***; Generated only *.
- **Model 2 Southern**: True **; Generated ns.
- **Model 3 Age**: True *; Generated ns.
- **Model 3 Southern**: True **; Generated ns.

**Fix:** match the sample (N) and coding first. Only after that should you compare stars. Also confirm you’re using the same two-tailed thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001), which the True Results specify.

---

## 6) What to change so the generated analysis matches Table 1

### A. Rebuild model-specific analysis samples (most important)
For each model, construct the dataset using **only**:
- outcome `num_genres_disliked`
- the predictors included in that model

Then apply **listwise deletion** on that set only. Do not carry forward the most restrictive sample from Model 3 back into Model 1/2.

### B. Fix Hispanic dropping / NA in Model 3
- Audit the `hispanic` recode:
  - ensure it is 0/1 with meaningful non-missing values
  - ensure missing codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) are properly recoded and not wiping valid responses
- Verify no perfect collinearity with other race dummies.

### C. Align dummy/reference categories to the paper
Ensure the reference group is consistent with Table 1 conventions (usually White, male, non-South, etc.). Race dummies must be **mutually exclusive**.

### D. Ensure β calculation matches the paper
The paper reports **standardized OLS coefficients**:
- Run OLS on raw variables (to get intercept consistent with paper’s coding).
- Compute standardized betas for slopes (either by standardized variables or post-hoc conversion), but ensure the βs correspond to the same model and sample.

### E. Verify construction of key composite measures
- `inc_pc` (income per capita): confirm formula and scaling.
- `pol_intol`: confirm which items, how combined, range, and missing handling.

If you want, paste (1) your variable coding/recode snippets for `inc_pc`, `pol_intol`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, and `south`, and (2) how you build the per-model analysis frames; I can pinpoint exactly where the extra case loss and sign flips are coming from.
