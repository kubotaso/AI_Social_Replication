Score: 40/100
============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True Results (Table 1)**, covering **variable names, coefficients (standardized betas), constants, fit statistics, N**, and **interpretation/significance**—plus what you must change to make the generated analysis match the printed table.

---

## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (N, R², Adj. R², constant)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **758**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s. You need to reproduce the paper’s **sample inclusion/exclusion rules** (missingness handling, any listwise deletion scope, and any DV construction rules). At minimum, ensure the DV and the 3 SES predictors match the paper’s coding and that you’re not inadvertently dropping cases (e.g., due to recodes creating NAs).

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.1088; Adj R² = 0.1052**
  - True: **R² = 0.107; Adj R² = 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample and variable coding match, these should align. Small differences could also come from:
    - weighting vs unweighted OLS,
    - different standardization procedure (see Section 3),
    - different DV scoring (e.g., prorating thresholds, item inclusion).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **11.086**
  - True: **10.920**
  - **Fix:** Intercepts depend on the **unstandardized model** (and on DV/predictor coding). If the paper reports the constant from an unstandardized OLS on the same sample, your mismatch indicates you are **not using the same DV scale and/or sample**.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **522**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is a major discrepancy. Your Model 2 is dropping ~234 more cases than it should. Likely causes:
    - you created extra missingness in one or more demographic variables (race, religion, region, etc.),
    - you’re requiring nonmissingness on variables the paper did not require, or
    - you restricted to a subsample (e.g., only those with polintol valid, etc.) accidentally.
  - Concretely: replicate the paper’s listwise deletion for **Model 2 variables only**, not for Model 3. Do **not** apply Model 3’s nonmissing restrictions to Model 2.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.157 / 0.139**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Adj R² matches; R² slightly higher in generated, consistent with a different sample/coding.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.100**
  - True: **8.507**
  - **Fix:** Again points to different DV scaling and/or different sample composition.

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **343**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Your Model 3 sample is far too small. Your own diagnostics show a special restriction:
    - Generated diagnostics: `N_polintol_nonmissing(prorated>=12) = 581`
  - That “**prorated>=12**” rule is a red flag: it suggests you required a minimum number of items/threshold for constructing political intolerance (or some prorated scale), which may **not** match the paper’s construction. To match Table 1, you must use the **same political intolerance measure definition** (items, coding, missing-data handling, and any threshold). Then do listwise deletion for Model 3 predictors only.

- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.149 / 0.118**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Your model explains much less variance than the paper’s; this is consistent with (a) different polintol measure, (b) different sample, (c) different DV coding.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **7.267**
  - True: **6.516**
  - **Fix:** Same issue: DV/predictor coding and sample.

---

## 2) Variable name mismatches (mostly minor, but one substantive)

### Names
- Generated uses: `educ`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conserv_prot`, `no_religion`, `south`, `polintol`
- True table names: Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Political intolerance

**Fix:** Rename in output to match the paper’s labels. That’s cosmetic, but it matters for “matching.”

### Substantive potential naming/coding mismatch: “Southern”
- Generated variable: `south`
- True variable: “Southern”
- This is fine if `south` is coded exactly as the paper (South vs non-South). If your coding differs (e.g., including border states differently, or coding missing as 0), coefficients and N will diverge.

---

## 3) Standardized coefficients (betas): every mismatch

Below I compare the **standardized betas** (since that’s what Table 1 prints). I’m listing **Generated beta vs True beta**, and noting sign/magnitude/significance issues.

### Model 1 (SES): betas
- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.332***  
  - True: **-0.322***  
  - Fix: small difference; likely sample/coding/standardization method.

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.034**
  - True: **-0.037**
  - Fix: small difference.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **0.029**
  - True: **0.016**
  - Fix: moderate difference; likely coding of prestige variable and/or sample.

**Key fix for Model 1 betas:** Ensure you are standardizing exactly as the paper did. Table 1 reports “standardized OLS coefficients.” That usually means either:
1) run OLS on raw variables and then compute beta = b * (SDx/SDy) using the estimation sample, OR  
2) z-score all variables (DV and predictors) and run OLS (intercept ≈ 0 in that case).

Your intercept is nonzero, implying you did **not** z-score the DV/predictors before estimation (fine), but then your computed standardized betas must be computed identically to the paper’s method **on the same sample**.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic): betas (many mismatches)
- **Education**
  - Gen **-0.302*** vs True **-0.246*** (too large in magnitude)
- **Income per capita**
  - Gen **-0.056** vs True **-0.054** (close)
- **Occupational prestige**
  - Gen **-0.007** vs True **-0.006** (close)
- **Female**
  - Gen **-0.080** vs True **-0.083*** (close magnitude, but your significance differs; see Section 5)
- **Age**
  - Gen **0.108*** (actually your table shows `0.108*`) vs True **0.140*** (too small, wrong significance strength)
- **Black**
  - Gen **0.052** vs True **0.029** (too large)
- **Hispanic**
  - Gen **-0.017** vs True **-0.029** (too small)
- **Other race**
  - Gen **-0.016** vs True **0.005** (**sign mismatch**)
- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Gen **0.038** vs True **0.059** (too small)
- **No religion**
  - Gen **-0.017** vs True **-0.012** (close)
- **Southern**
  - Gen **0.082** vs True **0.097** (too small, significance differs)

**Fix:** These are not just rounding issues; combined with the huge N mismatch, they strongly indicate you are not estimating the same model on the same cases with the same codings.
- First priority: fix Model 2’s **N (522 → 756)** by matching missingness rules and variable coding.
- Second: ensure factor/dummy coding matches the paper. In particular, the **“Other race” sign flip** suggests you may be using a different reference category or a different race coding scheme than the paper.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): betas (many mismatches)
- **Education**
  - Gen **-0.156***? (your long table: -0.156*), True **-0.151** **(True is **)** not *  
- **Income per capita**
  - Gen **-0.074** vs True **-0.009** (very large mismatch)
- **Occupational prestige**
  - Gen **0.014** vs True **-0.022** (**sign mismatch**)
- **Female**
  - Gen **-0.117***? (long table: -0.117*), True **-0.095*** (bigger magnitude in generated)
- **Age**
  - Gen **0.080** vs True **0.110*** (too small, and you don’t get significance)
- **Black**
  - Gen **0.066** vs True **0.049** (somewhat larger)
- **Hispanic**
  - Gen **0.017** vs True **0.031** (too small)
- **Other race**
  - Gen **0.034** vs True **0.053** (too small)
- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Gen **0.002** vs True **0.066** (near zero vs moderate positive: major mismatch)
- **No religion**
  - Gen **0.023** vs True **0.024** (matches well)
- **Southern**
  - Gen **0.078** vs True **0.121** (too small; significance differs)
- **Political intolerance**
  - Gen **0.208*** vs True **0.164*** (too large)

**Fix:** This pattern strongly suggests your **political intolerance variable is constructed differently** and/or your Model 3 sample is not the same (343 vs 503). The income beta being -0.074 (generated) versus -0.009 (true) also suggests either:
- income was transformed differently (per capita definition differs), or
- you used a different subset (e.g., selection correlated with income), or
- you standardized using a different SD (e.g., full sample SD vs estimation-sample SD).

---

## 4) Standard errors: mismatch is conceptual, not numeric

- **True results:** Table 1 **does not report standard errors**.
- **Generated results:** You implicitly act as if SEs exist/are comparable (you report p-values and stars derived from your SEs).

**Mismatch:** You cannot “match” SEs to Table 1 because they are **not in the true table**.

**Fix options:**
1) **Remove SE/p-values** from the “matching” requirement and compare only betas + N + R² + constants, OR  
2) Obtain the paper’s SEs from another table/appendix/supplement (or re-estimate using the same data and design), then compare.

---

## 5) Significance / interpretation mismatches (stars)

Because Table 1’s stars are based on the authors’ model/sample, your stars often disagree.

Key mismatches:
- **Model 2 age:** True **0.140***, Generated **0.108***? (your output gives only `*`). Your p-value in long table is .0126 (one star), not ***.
- **Model 2 female:** True has `*`, generated p=.055 (no star). You miss significance.
- **Model 2 southern:** True **0.097**`**`, generated p=.052 (no star).
- **Model 3 education:** True `**`, generated `*`.
- **Model 3 age:** True `*`, generated none.
- **Model 3 southern:** True `**`, generated none.
- **Model 3 conserv_prot:** True positive (0.066), generated ~0 with p=.977 (completely different substantive inference).

**Fix:** Significance will not match until:
- the **same N and variable codings** are used,
- the same **estimation approach** is used (plain OLS vs weighted; robust vs conventional SEs; clustered SEs; etc.).
Table 1 says “standardized OLS coefficients”; it does *not* say robust/clustered. If you used robust SEs, that can change stars even when coefficients match.

---

## 6) Structural/output discrepancies in your generated tables

- Your `table1_style_betas` has **NaNs** for non-included variables (fine), but the ordering and alignment should match the paper exactly. Ensure the constant and R² lines are presented as in the paper (your “fit_stats” is separate; the paper prints them in the same table).
- Your `fit_stats` includes a column `dropped_no_variance` but the True table has no such field.
  - **Fix:** Drop non-paper columns from the “match” output, or clearly separate “replication diagnostics” from “Table 1 reproduction.”

---

## 7) Most likely root causes (and exact fixes to implement)

### A) Sample definition/listwise deletion is wrong (major)
Evidence: N is off in all models, catastrophically in Models 2–3.

**Fix:**
- For each model, perform **listwise deletion only on variables in that model** (DV + included predictors), and do it exactly as the authors did.
- Do **not** impose Model 3 restrictions (e.g., your `prorated>=12`) on Model 2.

### B) DV construction differs (“number of music genres disliked”)
Evidence: constants and R² differ; N_complete_music_DV is 893 in diagnostics, but model Ns don’t align with paper Ns.

**Fix:**
- Rebuild DV exactly:
  - same set of genres,
  - same coding of “disliked”,
  - same handling of “don’t know,” skips, inapplicable,
  - same prorating rules (if any) and thresholds (if any).

### C) Political intolerance scale construction differs (major)
Evidence: Model 3 N too small; polintol beta too large; conserv_prot and income effects very different.

**Fix:**
- Recreate “political intolerance” exactly (items and scoring).
- Remove/adjust your “prorated>=12” rule unless the paper explicitly uses it.
- Ensure the scale direction matches (higher = more intolerant, presumably).

### D) Dummy/reference category coding differs (notably race)
Evidence: Model 2 “Other race” sign mismatch; multiple race coefficients differ.

**Fix:**
- Ensure reference group matches the paper (typically White as reference, with Black/Hispanic/Other as dummies).
- Ensure mutually exclusive race categories constructed the same way as authors did.

### E) Standardization method differs
Evidence: many beta differences even where signs match.

**Fix:**
- Compute standardized betas exactly like the paper:
  - Prefer: estimate unstandardized OLS, then convert to standardized betas using **SDs from the estimation sample**.
- Do not use full-sample SDs if the paper uses model-specific sample SDs (common in listwise deletion contexts).

### F) Weighting / design effects (possible)
If the paper used weights and you didn’t (or vice versa), N can be the same but coefficients differ; here N differs too, but weights could still contribute.

**Fix:**
- Check whether the study uses survey weights (common in GSS-based analyses). Apply the same weights and replicate their approach.

## 8) Checklist: what must match to reproduce Table 1 exactly

To make the generated analysis match the True Table 1:
1) Match **Model Ns**: 787 / 756 / 503  
2) Match **DV and key predictors coding** (especially polintol, income per capita, region, race)  
3) Match **dummy/reference categories**  
4) Match **standardization method** (beta computation)  
5) Match **OLS specification** (weights? robust SEs? though SEs aren’t printed)  
6) Only then tune rounding to reproduce the printed betas (typically 3 decimals)

If you provide your code (or just: how DV/polintol were built, missingness rules, and whether weights/robust SEs were used), I can pinpoint which specific rule is causing the N collapse in Models 2–3 and the sign flips.
