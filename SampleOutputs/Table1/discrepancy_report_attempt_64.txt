============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics: R², adj. R², and N all mismatch

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your Model 1 is using listwise deletion on something that is *not* part of Model 1 (very likely the later-added demographics or political intolerance). Re-run Model 1 using *only* the three SES predictors + outcome, and drop missingness only on those variables.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, **adj. R² = 0.085**
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, **adj. R² = 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample is corrected to match the paper’s Model 1 sample (N=787), R² should move. Also verify:
    - outcome coding (same scale as paper’s “number of genres disliked”),
    - weights (paper may use GSS weights; if you didn’t, coefficients/R² can shift),
    - whether you standardized variables the same way as the paper.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** Massive sample loss indicates you are inadvertently requiring non-missing values on variables not in Model 2 (most likely `pol_intol`, which your missingness table shows is ~47% missing). Ensure Model 2 does **not** filter on political intolerance.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.139**, **adj. R² = 0.120**
  - True: **R² = 0.151**, **adj. R² = 0.139**
  - **Fix:** With N corrected (and same weighting/standardization/coding as the paper), these should align more closely.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** You’re losing far more cases than political intolerance missingness alone would imply if the starting sample were 756. This suggests additional unintended exclusions (e.g., mishandled recodes generating NAs, using complete.cases across the *entire dataset*, or dropping “don’t know/refused” incorrectly). Restrict listwise deletion to Model 3 variables only, and confirm recodes.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.149**, **adj. R² = 0.111**
  - True: **R² = 0.169**, **adj. R² = 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Same as above—sample mismatch is the primary driver. Adj. R² especially collapses when N drops and you keep many predictors.

## 2) Variable-name / reporting mismatches (and why they matter)

### You mix unstandardized and standardized coefficients across outputs
- In `model*_full`, you report **b** (unstandardized) and **beta** (standardized).
- In `table1_panel`, you report only the **standardized beta** for predictors (and constants unstandardized), which is consistent with the paper.

**But** your interpretations and significance should be based on the same target as the “true results” table:
- The “true results” are **standardized betas (β)** for predictors.
- **Fix:** When comparing to the paper, compare **your beta column**, not **b**. And don’t treat “b” mismatches as “paper mismatches” because the paper isn’t reporting them.

### Some variable labels differ from the paper’s conceptual labels
Not fatal, but can hide coding mistakes:
- Generated uses: `Black`, `Hispanic`, `Other race`, `Southern`, `No religion`, `Conservative Protestant`, `Female`, `Age`
- True uses the same concepts, but you must ensure reference categories match the paper’s.
- **Fix:** Verify dummy coding:
  - race dummies relative to **White** (typically the omitted category),
  - religion dummies relative to **mainline/other Christian** or whatever the paper uses,
  - region relative to non-South.

---

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model (these are the big substantive discrepancies)

Below I compare **standardized coefficients (β)** because that’s what Table 1 reports.

### Model 1 (SES): all three predictors + constant mismatch
- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.292***  
  - True β: **-0.322***  
  - **Fix:** likely sample mismatch (N 747 vs 787), plus possibly different standardization (e.g., you standardized on analytic sample vs full sample; paper likely standardized on the analytic sample but you must match it).

- **Income per capita**
  - Generated β: **-0.039**
  - True β: **-0.037**
  - Small difference; likely resolves with correct N/weights.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **0.020**
  - True β: **0.016**
  - Small difference; again probably sample/weights.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.638**
  - True: **10.920**
  - **Fix:** constant depends on unstandardized model specification and sample. Will change with N, coding, and whether predictors were centered/standardized before fitting (they should **not** be standardized before fitting if you want the paper’s unstandardized constant).

### Model 2 (Demographic): multiple direction/sign mismatches
Major ones:

- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.265***  
  - True β: **-0.246***  
  - Difference could be sample + standardization.

- **Age**
  - Generated β: **0.103*** (actually your sig is `*`, p=.019)  
  - True β: **0.140***  
  - **Fix:** your estimate is much smaller and less significant; the biggest suspect is again the wrong analytic sample (you used N=507 instead of 756). Also verify age coding (years vs categories).

- **Black**
  - Generated β: **0.100** (p=.219)
  - True β: **0.029**
  - **Fix:** This is not a small drift; likely a coding/reference-category issue or a sample composition issue created by erroneous listwise deletion (e.g., excluding many whites disproportionately).

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated β: **+0.074**
  - True β: **-0.029**
  - **Fix:** sign flip strongly suggests miscoding:
    - you may have coded `hispanic = 1` for non-Hispanic, or
    - you may have mixed “Hispanic ethnicity” with “Hispanic race” variable, or
    - reference category problems (e.g., including both Hispanic and race dummies incorrectly).
  - Check the exact GSS variable and recode logic.

- **Other race**
  - Generated β: **-0.027**
  - True β: **+0.005**
  - **Fix:** same family of race/ethnicity coding problems.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated β: **0.087** (p=.059; no star)
  - True β: **0.059** (no star)
  - **Fix:** magnitude difference likely sample.

- **Southern**
  - Generated β: **0.061** (ns)
  - True β: **0.097** **(significant)**  
  - **Fix:** wrong sample (N=507) will reduce precision; also verify south coding.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **8.675**
  - True: **8.507**
  - Likely resolves with correct sample and ensuring predictors not standardized pre-fit.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): several mismatches, including stars
- **Income per capita**
  - Generated β: **-0.052**
  - True β: **-0.009**
  - **Fix:** huge discrepancy suggests income variable construction differs from paper (e.g., not actually “per capita,” wrong scaling, or using raw income category coded numerically). Ensure:
    - income is converted to a meaningful metric (or at least the same as paper),
    - then divided by household size for per-capita,
    - then standardized beta computed from that.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **-0.015**
  - True β: **-0.022**
  - Small-ish.

- **Age**
  - Generated β: **0.091** (ns, p=.129)
  - True β: **0.110*** (significant at p<.05)
  - **Fix:** your N is **286** vs **503**. Loss of power alone can remove significance.

- **Black / Hispanic**
  - Generated: Black β **0.060**; Hispanic β **-0.030**
  - True: Black β **0.049**; Hispanic β **+0.031**
  - Hispanic sign mismatch again suggests miscoding/definition mismatch.

- **Southern**
  - Generated β: **0.068** (ns)
  - True β: **0.121** **(significant)**
  - **Fix:** again sample + possibly south coding.

- **Political intolerance**
  - Generated β: **0.184** with ** (p=.0038)
  - True β: **0.164*** (p<.001)
  - **Fix:** your effect is larger but less “starred” because your N is drastically smaller. With correct N and correct variable construction, β should drop closer to 0.164 and p should become <.001 (***).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **7.999**
  - True: **6.516**
  - **Fix:** This is a large gap. Often caused by:
    - using different coding for political intolerance (scale shift),
    - different coding of outcome,
    - or fitting with different included cases and/or different handling of missing codes (e.g., treating “DK” as numeric).
  - Ensure all “DK/NA/Refused” are set to missing before modeling, and political intolerance is on the same scale as the paper.

---

## 4) Standard errors: you’re reporting them implicitly (via p-values), but the “true” table does not
- The paper’s Table 1 **does not report SEs**—only β and stars.
- Your output includes p-values (hence SEs exist in your model), but you **cannot** “match SEs” to the table because they aren’t provided.
- **Fix:** For comparison, strip SE/p from the “matching” table and compare only:
  - constants (unstandardized),
  - standardized β,
  - stars using the same thresholds.

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars do not match in several places)

Because your p-values depend heavily on the (incorrect) N, your star patterns diverge:

- **Model 2 Age:** Generated `*` vs True `***`
- **Model 2 Southern:** Generated none vs True `**`
- **Model 3 Age:** Generated none vs True `*`
- **Model 3 Political intolerance:** Generated `**` vs True `***`
- **Model 3 Education:** Generated `*` vs True `**`

**Fix:** get the analytic samples to match first (Ns), then re-check stars. If stars still differ, check:
- weighting (GSS weight variable),
- exact two-tailed cutoffs (paper’s: .05/.01/.001),
- robust vs conventional SEs (paper likely uses conventional OLS unless stated).

---

## 6) The missingness table reveals the main root cause: you are using the wrong deletion rule
Your missingness shows:
- `pol_intol` missing **47%**
- outcome missing **44%**
- `hispanic` missing **35%**

Yet:
- True Model 2 N is **756**, which is *much larger* than your Model 2 N=507.
This strongly indicates you accidentally required non-missing `pol_intol` (or some other highly-missing variable) for Model 2.

**Concrete fix (procedural):**
- Build **three separate analytic datasets**, one per model, each defined as complete cases on:
  - outcome + predictors in that model only.
- Do **not** pre-drop missingness globally before fitting Model 1/2.
- Example logic (in any stats package):  
  - `data_m1 = data[complete.cases(y, educ, inc_pc, prestige), ]`  
  - `data_m2 = data[complete.cases(y, educ, inc_pc, prestige, female, age, race dummies, religion dummies, south), ]`  
  - `data_m3 = data[complete.cases(y, m2 predictors..., pol_intol), ]`

## 7) Checklist to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Reconstruct variables exactly as the paper**
   - Confirm outcome matches “Number of music genres disliked” (same items, same missing rules).
   - Confirm `inc_pc` truly is **income per capita** (income ÷ household size) and not just income.
   - Confirm political intolerance scale and direction.

2. **Handle GSS missing codes correctly**
   - Set “Don’t know / No answer / Refused / Not applicable” to missing before any transformations.
   - This is especially important for political intolerance and income.

3. **Model-specific listwise deletion**
   - Don’t let Model 2 inherit Model 3’s missingness.

4. **Use the same weighting/estimation choices as the paper**
   - If the paper uses a GSS weight, apply it.
   - Use OLS with the same SE type (conventional vs robust).

5. **Compare the right quantities**
   - Compare **standardized β** for predictors.
   - Compare **unstandardized constant**.
   - Do not attempt to match SEs when the table doesn’t report them.

If you share the code (or at least the exact variable construction steps for `num_genres_disliked`, `inc_pc`, `hispanic`, and `pol_intol`, plus whether weights were used), I can pinpoint which recode is causing the sign flips (especially Hispanic) and the constant gap in Model 3.
