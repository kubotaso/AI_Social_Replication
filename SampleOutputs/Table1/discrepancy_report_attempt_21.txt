## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is missing from the generated models**
- **True Table 1 includes:** `Hispanic` in Models 2 and 3.
- **Generated results include instead:** nothing in that row position; your `table1_style` shows a `—` line where Hispanic should be, and `coefficients_long` has no `hispanic` term at all.
- **Fix**
  1. Create/verify the dummy exactly as in the article (likely `hispanic=1` if respondent is Hispanic, else 0).
  2. Include it in Model 2 and Model 3 formulas.
  3. Ensure the reference category matches the paper (typically White non-Hispanic is the omitted group, with separate dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other).

### B. **Political intolerance significance level is wrong**
- **True:** Political intolerance = **0.164*** (p < .001)
- **Generated:** political_intolerance = **0.166\*\*** (p = 0.00147 shown; that would actually warrant *** under the table’s rule p < .001, but it’s not < .001)
- **Fix**
  - First, confirm you’re using the **same N and same scale construction** for political intolerance as the paper (see Section 4 on sample/N and construction).
  - Second, use the **paper’s significance thresholds** exactly and apply them consistently. If your p-value is 0.00147, it should be `**` (p < .01) not `***`. To match the paper’s `***`, you need to reproduce their p-value (< .001), which likely requires matching their sample (N=503) and/or exact index/standardization.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I list every coefficient mismatch comparing generated vs true (by model). Differences are not rounding noise; many are meaningfully off.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | -0.332*** | too negative |
| Household income per capita | -0.037 | -0.034 | slightly off |
| Occupational prestige | 0.016 | 0.029 | too positive |
| Constant | 10.920 | 11.086 | too high |
| R² | 0.107 | 0.1088 | slightly off |
| Adj R² | 0.104 | 0.1052 | slightly off |
| N | 787 | 758 | **wrong N** |

**Fixes (Model 1)**
- The N mismatch (787 vs 758) is the big red flag: your betas will not match if the estimation sample differs.
- You are dropping cases due to missingness in `educ` (47), `income_pc` (71), `prestg80` (33), which yields 758 complete cases. The paper evidently retained more (787), meaning at least one of these is handled differently in the “true” analysis (e.g., different missing-code handling, different variable versions, imputation, or different source year/subsample).
- To match: replicate the paper’s **exact sample definition** and **missing-data rules** (see Section 4).

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.259*** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.054 | -0.050 | slightly off |
| Occupational prestige | -0.006 | 0.006 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.089** | stronger + different sig |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.129*** | too small |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.030 | matches (rounding) |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **missing** | **omitted variable** |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.001 | off |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.059 | 0.067 | off (and you give p≈.074) |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.004 | off |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.084* | too small + weaker sig |
| Constant | 8.507 | 8.788 | too high |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.145 | too low |
| Adj R² | 0.139 | 0.134 | too low |
| N | 756 | 756 | matches |

**Fixes (Model 2)**
1. **Add Hispanic** (critical): omitting it changes multiple coefficients (prestige sign, female, age, southern, etc.) via confounding/correlation with race/ethnicity and region.
2. **Verify coding for occupational prestige (`prestg80`)**:
   - Sign flip suggests you might not be using the same prestige measure (or you standardized differently).
   - Check that higher `prestg80` truly means higher prestige and that you did not reverse-code or use a different prestige scale.
3. **Standardization method must match the paper**
   - Table 1 reports *standardized OLS coefficients*. That can mean:
     - Standardize **all variables before OLS**, then report unstandardized slopes, or
     - Compute standardized betas from an unstandardized model.
   - These are usually equivalent for linear regression, but *not* if you standardize using a different sample (e.g., standardizing on full sample vs regression sample) or apply weights.
   - Ensure you standardize using the **same estimation sample** per model as the paper (or whatever they did).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.161** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.009 | -0.012 | off |
| Occupational prestige | -0.022 | -0.008 | too close to 0 (and wrong direction magnitude) |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.114* | too negative |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.060 | **much smaller; loses significance** |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.062 | off |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | **missing** | **omitted variable** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.051 | close |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.066 | 0.053 | off |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.020 | close |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.087 | too small; loses sig |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.166** | sig mismatch + (likely) sample mismatch |
| Constant | 6.516 | 7.355 | too high |
| R² | 0.169 | 0.139 | too low |
| Adj R² | 0.148 | 0.117 | too low |
| N | 503 | 426 | **wrong N** |

**Fixes (Model 3)**
- Two structural problems drive most mismatches:
  1. **Omitted Hispanic** (same as Model 2).
  2. **Wrong estimation sample / missing-data handling**: you use N=426 vs paper N=503.

## 3) “Standard errors” are incorrectly presented/interpreted

### A. The paper does **not** report standard errors in Table 1
- **True statement:** “Table 1 … reports standardized coefficients only and does not print standard errors.”
- **Generated `table1_style` prints a second line under each coefficient** that looks like SEs (e.g., educ SE = -0.050 etc.).
- Those “SEs” are also impossible as SEs because several are negative (SEs cannot be negative).

**Fix**
- If you want to match Table 1, **remove the SE rows entirely** from the formatted table.
- If you want to add SEs anyway (not in the paper), compute and report them correctly:
  - ensure they are positive
  - label them clearly as SEs
  - do not claim they come from Table 1
- Also, don’t mix “beta_std” with SE formatting unless you’re explicit you’re reporting SEs of standardized coefficients (which requires consistent computation).

---

## 4) Sample / missingness discrepancies (major cause)

### A. N mismatches
- **Model 1:** True N=787; Generated N=758 (−29)
- **Model 3:** True N=503; Generated N=426 (−77)
- **Model 2:** matches at 756

These are too large to be rounding or minor cleaning differences. Your diagnostics show:
- `N_complete_music_18 = 893` (starting pool)
- M1 complete cases = 758 due to missing in SES vars
- M3 complete cases = 426 due mostly to `political_intolerance` missing (402 missing)

**Fix**
1. Replicate the paper’s **analytic sample definition** precisely:
   - same year (you reference 1993)
   - same age restriction (“music_18” suggests age >= 18)
   - same exclusion rules
2. Replicate the paper’s **handling of missing data**:
   - They may have used a different political intolerance measure with fewer missings, different “don’t know/refused” coding, or allowed partial information (e.g., scale computed if at least k items observed).
   - Your `political_intolerance_nonmissing_strict15 = 491` indicates a “strict15” rule that yields 491 nonmissing, but the regression N is 426—so you’re also losing additional cases to other covariates. The paper ends at 503, which is *higher than your 491*, implying your construction is stricter than theirs or based on a different item set.
3. Ensure you’re using the same **weighting** (if any). Weighted analyses can also change effective N reporting conventions and coefficients.

---

## 5) Interpretation / reporting mismatches

### A. Wrong claim/implication about SEs
- Generated output implicitly interprets the second row as SEs. That contradicts the “True Results” note and is also mathematically inconsistent (negative “SEs”).
- **Fix:** remove SEs or compute them properly and clearly state they are not from the PDF’s Table 1.

### B. Significance stars inconsistent with stated thresholds
- You state thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001). With p=0.00147, `**` is correct, but the true table reports `***`. That indicates **your p-values are not matching** the true analysis (not merely a star-formatting bug).
- **Fix:** match the sample, measure construction, and (if relevant) weights; then recompute p-values.

---

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches the “true” Table 1

1. **Add the Hispanic dummy** to Models 2 and 3 (and ensure correct reference category).
2. **Rebuild political intolerance** to match the paper’s scale (items, coding, and allowed missingness) so that:
   - N in Model 3 becomes **503**
   - coefficient and p-value match (0.164***)
3. **Reproduce the paper’s missing-data rules for SES variables** so Model 1 N becomes **787** (not 758).
4. **Do not print SEs** in Table 1-style output; the paper doesn’t include them. If you include SEs for your own appendix, compute them correctly and label them.
5. **Verify prestige and income variable definitions** (same source variable, coding direction, and standardization sample). The prestige sign flip in Model 2 is a strong indicator something is not aligned.

If you paste the model formulas/code you used (especially how you construct `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`, and how you standardize), I can point to the exact lines that need changing to reproduce the printed Table 1.
