Score: 17/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: **n, R², adjusted R²**
**Mismatch**
- **Model 1 n**: Generated **748** vs True **787**
- **Model 1 R² / adj R²**: Generated **0.097 / 0.0938** vs True **0.107 / 0.104**
- **Model 2 & 3**: Generated show **n = 0 and R² = NaN** (model not actually estimated) vs True **n = 756** (Model 2) and **n = 503** (Model 3) with valid R²/adj R².

**How to fix**
- Ensure the dependent variable and all RHS variables are present and correctly coded, then run each model on the intended estimation sample.
- Use *listwise deletion per model* (typical of published OLS tables):  
  - Model 1 should drop only cases missing **educ_yrs, inc_pc, prestg80_v, num_genres_disliked**.
  - Model 2 additionally drops missing on demographics (female, age, race dummies, religion, south).
  - Model 3 additionally drops missing on **pol_intol**.
- Your own missingness table already explains the failure: **`hispanic` is 100% missing**, which forces Model 2/3 to have no complete cases if you include that variable.

---

### 2) Variable-name / coding problems (the reason Models 2–3 collapse)
**Mismatch**
- Generated models use variable labels like **“Hispanic”** and your missingness table shows a variable named **`hispanic`** with **0 nonmissing (100% missing)**.
- True results clearly include a working Hispanic indicator (since Model 2 has n=756 and includes “Hispanic”).

**How to fix**
- You likely created/loaded the Hispanic variable incorrectly (e.g., wrong column name, wrong merge, recode produced all NA).
- Fix by reconstructing it from the GSS race/ethnicity fields used in the paper (common GSS approach is an ethnicity variable separate from race). Concretely:
  - Verify the raw source variable(s) exist (e.g., `hispanic`, `ethnic`, `hispan`, etc. depending on extract).
  - Recode to a 0/1 dummy without turning non-Hispanic into NA.
  - After recoding, check `table(hispanic, useNA="ifany")` (R) or value counts (Python) to ensure both 0 and 1 exist and NA rate is reasonable.
- Then re-run Models 2 and 3; the NaNs will disappear.

### 3) Coefficients reported: **standardized (β) vs unstandardized (b)**
The published Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constants**.

#### Model 1 (SES)
**Mismatches (β)**
- Education: Generated **-0.310*** vs True **-0.322*** (wrong magnitude)
- Income: Generated **-0.038** vs True **-0.037** (close but not exact)
- Prestige: Generated **0.025** vs True **0.016** (not close; wrong)

**Mismatch (Constant)**
- Generated Constant **10.848** vs True **10.920**

**How to fix**
- Make sure you are using the *same sample* as the paper (your n differs: 748 vs 787). Standardized coefficients are sensitive to sample composition.
- Standardize predictors the same way as the original analysis:
  - If you compute β by standardizing variables (z-scores) before OLS, do it **only on the estimation sample for that model**.
  - Alternatively compute β from unstandardized b via:  
    \[
    \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{\text{SD}(x_j)}{\text{SD}(y)}
    \]
    again using SDs from the model’s estimation sample.
- Constants: if you fit a model on standardized predictors (but not y), the intercept will differ from the published unstandardized constant unless you reproduce the exact method. The safest replication route is:
  - Fit OLS on raw variables to get the constant.
  - Separately compute standardized βs for the table.

### 4) Model 2 and Model 3 coefficients: **missing vs present**
**Mismatch**
- Generated: all coefficients are **NaN** in Models 2 and 3.
- True: full sets of standardized coefficients and constants are reported.

**How to fix**
- Primary fix is the Hispanic variable (and any other all-missing dummy) so that complete cases exist.
- Then ensure you include exactly the RHS variables listed in the true table, with matching reference categories (see next point).

---

### 5) Reference categories / dummy construction (race, religion, region)
Even after fixing missingness, you can still “get numbers” but not match the paper if baselines differ.

**Potential mismatches to check (very common in replications)**
- **Race dummies**: True table includes Black, Hispanic, Other race — implying the omitted category is likely **White non-Hispanic**.
- **Religion dummies**: Conservative Protestant, No religion — omitted category likely “other/remaining religions.”
- **Region**: Southern — omitted category non-South.

**How to fix**
- Ensure 0/1 dummies and the same omitted categories as the original study.
- Confirm the coding yields plausible distributions (no all-1 or all-0).
- If you used factor coding automatically, lock the reference level explicitly (R: `relevel()`, Python patsy: `Treatment(reference=...)`).

---

### 6) Interpretation/significance reporting
**Mismatch**
- Generated output includes **p-values and SEs**, and stars based on those p-values.
- True Table 1: **SEs are not reported**; only standardized β and stars appear.

**How to fix**
- If your goal is to match the *paper’s table*, suppress SE and p in the final “Table1-style” output and show:
  - standardized β for predictors
  - unstandardized constant
  - stars using the paper’s thresholds (*, **, *** as given)
- If you keep p-values for internal checking, that’s fine—but don’t present them as if they were “Table 1 extracted.”

---

### 7) Dependent variable alignment
**Potential mismatch to verify**
- True DV: **Number of Music Genres Disliked** (GSS 1993).
- Generated DV name in missingness: **`num_genres_disliked`** (seems aligned), but your Model 1 sample size mismatch suggests you may be filtering years or constructing the index differently than the paper.

**How to fix**
- Ensure you are using **GSS 1993 only**, and the same construction rules for the “genres disliked” count (which items included, how DK/NA handled, whether “haven’t heard” counted as missing, etc.).
- Recompute DV exactly as in the paper, then re-run models.

## Summary of “every mismatch” visible in your outputs
1. **Model 1 n, R², adj R²** don’t match the true table.
2. **Model 2 and Model 3 are not estimated at all** (n=0, NaN everywhere) but should have valid results.
3. **Model 1 coefficients (β) differ** for Education, Income (slightly), Prestige (materially).
4. **Model 1 constant differs**.
5. **Hispanic variable is completely missing (100% NA)** in your data, contradicting the true table and causing Model 2/3 failure.
6. **Reporting format mismatch**: you report SE/p, but the true table does not; the target table is standardized β + stars (and unstandardized constants).

If you want, paste the code (or at least the variable construction for `hispanic`, the year filter, and how you computed standardized betas), and I can point to the exact line(s) that produce the NaNs and the sample-size drift.
