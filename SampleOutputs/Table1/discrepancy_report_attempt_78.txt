Score: 10/100
============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics: **n, R², adjusted R² all mismatch**

### Mismatches
- **Model 1**
  - Generated: **n=748**, R²=**0.0975**, adj R²=**0.0938**
  - True: **n=787**, R²=**0.107**, adj R²=**0.104**
- **Model 2**
  - Generated: **n=43**, R²=**0.4617**, adj R²=**0.2934**
  - True: **n=756**, R²=**0.151**, adj R²=**0.139**
- **Model 3**
  - Generated: **n=23**, R²=**0.6574**, adj R²=**0.3718**
  - True: **n=503**, R²=**0.169**, adj R²=**0.148**

### What’s wrong
- The generated Models 2–3 are being run on **tiny, incorrect samples** (43 and 23 cases), producing meaningless R² values and unstable coefficients.
- This almost certainly comes from **listwise deletion** plus **a catastrophic missingness/recoding error** (see §4), especially for **Hispanic** and **Political intolerance**.

### How to fix
- Recreate the paper’s analytic samples per model:
  - M1 should yield **~787**
  - M2 should yield **~756**
  - M3 should yield **~503**
- Ensure variables are coded correctly (especially Hispanic and political intolerance) and use the same missing-data rules as the paper (likely listwise deletion, but with *correct* coding so you don’t collapse to n=23).
- After fixing coding, recompute R²/adj R² and confirm they match the table.

## 2) Coefficients: widespread mismatches in **value, sign, and significance**

Important: the paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except constants). Your generated “Table1” appears to be using **beta** in some places, but the models are not matching because (a) the estimation sample is wrong and (b) some variables are mis-coded.

Below, I compare the **reported β** (True) to the **generated Table1 values**.

---

## 3) Model-by-model comparison (β and constant)

### Model 1 (SES)
| Term | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education (years) | **-0.310*** | **-0.322*** | Close but off (likely sample/coding differences) |
| Household income per capita | **-0.038** | **-0.037** | Essentially matches |
| Occupational prestige | **0.025** | **0.016** | Off |
| Constant | **10.848** | **10.920** | Off |
| R² / adj R² / n | **0.097/0.094/748** | **0.107/0.104/787** | Incorrect sample and fit |

**Fix:** use the correct sample construction for M1 and verify standardization method.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
Every major quantity is wrong because the model is estimated on **n=43** instead of **756**.

| Term | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.730** (**) | **-0.246*** | Magnitude wildly wrong |
| Income pc | **+0.109** | **-0.054** | **Sign wrong** |
| Prestige | **+0.406*** | **-0.006** | **Sign and magnitude wrong** |
| Female | **+0.079** | **-0.083*** | **Sign wrong** |
| Age | **+0.021** | **+0.140*** | Too small; significance wrong |
| Black | **-0.014** | **+0.029** | Sign wrong |
| Hispanic | **+0.020** | **-0.029** | Sign wrong |
| Other race | **-0.000** | **+0.005** | Wrong |
| Conservative Protestant | **+0.422*** | **+0.059** | Implausibly huge |
| No religion | **+0.151** | **-0.012** | Sign wrong |
| Southern | **+0.165** | **+0.097** ** | Too large; stars wrong |
| Constant | **8.452** | **8.507** | Close, but meaningless given wrong sample |
| R² / n | **0.462 / 43** | **0.151 / 756** | Completely wrong |

**Fix:** repairing missingness/coding (especially Hispanic/political intolerance) should restore n≈756 and bring coefficients back into the right range.

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
Again estimated on **n=23** instead of **503**, so almost everything is wrong.

| Term | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.043** | **-0.151** ** | Too small; significance wrong |
| Income pc | **-0.132** | **-0.009** | Way too large in magnitude |
| Prestige | **+0.332** | **-0.022** | **Sign wrong** |
| Female | **+0.288** | **-0.095*** | **Sign wrong** |
| Age | **+0.329** | **+0.110*** | Too large |
| Black | **-0.190** | **+0.049** | **Sign wrong** |
| Hispanic | **-0.000** | **+0.031** | Wrong |
| Other race | **0.000** | **+0.053** | Wrong |
| Conservative Protestant | **+0.693** ** | **+0.066** | Implausibly huge |
| No religion | **+0.291** | **+0.024** | Too large |
| Southern | **+0.267** | **+0.121** ** | Too large; stars wrong |
| Political intolerance | **+0.221** | **+0.164*** | Somewhat close numerically, but stars wrong due to tiny n |
| Constant | **-2.273** | **6.516** | **Huge mismatch** (likely coding/sample issue) |
| R² / n | **0.657 / 23** | **0.169 / 503** | Completely wrong |

**Fix:** correct coding + correct analytic sample for M3; then recompute standardized β and intercept.

## 4) Variable-name / coding discrepancies that are driving the collapse in n

### Hispanic is clearly broken
- Missingness table:
  - `hispanic nonmissing = 108; missing = 1498 (93.3% missing)`
- Dummy check suggests:
  - for the “hispanic dummy,” n is shown as **108** and mean **0.963** (i.e., almost all “1” among the few non-missing)

This is not a plausible representation for GSS Hispanic ethnicity and would *absolutely* nuke your sample in Models 2–3.

**Likely causes**
- Hispanic is being read from the wrong variable, or coded so that most values become NA.
- You may have created `hispanic` from a filter (e.g., only asked of a subsample), or reversed codes incorrectly (e.g., treating “inapplicable” as missing instead of “0”).

**Fix**
- Verify the correct GSS variable used in the paper for “Hispanic” and recode it to a 0/1 indicator with minimal missingness.
- Treat “not Hispanic” as 0, “Hispanic” as 1, and only actual nonresponse as missing.
- After recoding, confirm nonmissing is close to the model’s n (hundreds), not 108.

### Political intolerance is also causing major loss
- `pol_intol nonmissing = 850; missing = 756 (47.1%)`
- But your **Model 3 n=23**, which means *additional* variables are becoming missing after you assemble the model frame—most likely Hispanic, and/or income/education, and/or a merge mistake.

**Fix**
- Rebuild the Model 3 dataset stepwise and check how n changes after adding each variable:
  1) y only
  2) + SES vars
  3) + demographics
  4) + pol_intol  
  The step where n collapses identifies the culprit variable/coding.

## 5) Standard errors: generated output includes them, but the “true Table 1” does not

### Mismatch
- Generated results show p-values, and you implicitly have SEs (though not printed in Table1).
- True results: **SE not reported** in Table 1.

### Fix
- If your goal is to match Table 1, **do not present SEs** and do not attempt to “validate” SE values against the paper.
- Instead, match:
  - standardized β values
  - intercepts (constants)
  - significance stars (thresholds)

(You *can* compute SEs for your own replication, but they won’t be comparable to Table 1 because Table 1 omits them.)

---

## 6) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Because Models 2–3 are estimated on **n=43 and n=23**, p-values/stars are meaningless and will not align with the paper.

Examples:
- True Model 2: **Age 0.140***; Generated: 0.021 (p=0.894)
- True Model 3: **Political intolerance 0.164***; Generated: 0.221 (p=0.466)

**Fix**
- After restoring the correct sample sizes and coding, recompute p-values with OLS.
- Apply the paper’s two-tailed thresholds: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.

---

## 7) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true table

1) **Use the correct dependent variable**
   - Ensure `num_genres_disliked` matches the paper’s “Number of music genres disliked” construction.

2) **Fix Hispanic coding**
   - Identify the original GSS field used, recode to 0/1, and avoid turning “not in universe” into NA.
   - Recheck missingness; it should not be 93% missing.

3) **Fix political intolerance scale**
   - Confirm it is truly **0–15** as labeled and coded consistently.
   - Ensure “don’t know/NA” are missing, but valid 0–15 values remain numeric.

4) **Recreate model samples**
   - Run each model with listwise deletion *after* correct coding.
   - Confirm n approximately equals: **787, 756, 503**.

5) **Report standardized coefficients (β)**
   - Table 1 uses standardized coefficients for predictors.
   - Standardize continuous predictors (and confirm whether dummies are left unstandardized or also standardized; the paper implies standardized OLS coefficients overall, so standardizing all predictors before OLS is the straightforward approach to reproduce β).
   - Keep the **constant unstandardized**, matching the paper.

6) **Regenerate Table 1**
   - Output β values and constants and add stars based on the correct p-values.
   - Verify R² and adjusted R² align.

If you share the code (or at least the exact source variable names and recodes for Hispanic and political intolerance), I can pinpoint the precise recoding error that’s producing n=43 and n=23.
