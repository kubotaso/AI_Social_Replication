Score: 33/100
============================================================

Below is a point-by-point audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, grouped by (A) variable naming, (B) coefficients/significance, (C) standard errors, (D) fit statistics and N, and (E) interpretation/model setup. For each discrepancy I also say **how to fix it** so the generated output reproduces Table 1.

---

## A) Variable names / labeling mismatches

### A1) Variable naming differs from Table 1 (minor but important for exact match)
**Generated term names:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`  
**True Table 1 names:** Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Political intolerance.

**Fix**
- Relabel variables in the table output to match Table 1 exactly (presentation fix).
- But note: naming is not the main problem—your *values* also don’t match (below).

---

## B) Coefficient (standardized beta) mismatches — by model and variable

Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients** only. Your `coefficients_long` includes `beta_std` and those are the values that should match the printed table. They do not, in many places.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated beta_std | True beta | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.279*** | -0.322*** | **Mismatch** |
| Household income per capita | -0.049 (ns) | -0.037 (ns) | **Mismatch** |
| Occupational prestige | 0.032 (ns) | 0.016 (ns) | **Mismatch** |

**Fix**
1. Ensure you are using the **same analytic sample** as Table 1 (your N is wildly different; see Section D). Standardized betas will change with sample composition.
2. Ensure you standardize exactly as the authors did. Typical is:
   - compute z-scores using the estimation sample (listwise complete for that model),
   - run OLS on z-scored X and z-scored Y (or compute beta post-hoc from unstandardized b).
3. Verify the **DV construction** (see Section E). If your DV differs (range/handling of missing), betas change.

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated beta_std | True beta | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.240*** | -0.246*** | **Mismatch** (close, still not exact) |
| Income pc | -0.036 (ns) | -0.054 (ns) | **Mismatch** |
| Occ prestige | 0.029 (ns) | -0.006 (ns) | **Mismatch (sign flips)** |
| Female | -0.071* | -0.083* | **Mismatch** |
| Age | 0.035 (ns) | 0.140*** | **Major mismatch** |
| Black | -0.078 (ns) | 0.029 (ns) | **Mismatch (sign flips)** |
| Hispanic | 0.010 (ns) | -0.029 (ns) | **Mismatch (sign flips)** |
| Other race | 0.005 (ns) | 0.005 (ns) | **Match** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.118** | 0.059 (ns) | **Mismatch (size + significance)** |
| No religion | -0.004 (ns) | -0.012 (ns) | **Mismatch** (small) |
| Southern | 0.064 (.) | 0.097** | **Mismatch (size + significance)** |

**Fix**
- The extreme mismatch on **Age** (0.035 vs 0.140***) strongly suggests at least one of:
  1) age is coded differently (years vs categories; centered/scaled incorrectly; top-coding), or  
  2) you are using a different year/subsample than the PDF table, or  
  3) you standardized incorrectly (e.g., standardized across full dataset rather than model estimation sample).
- The sign flips for race variables suggest **different reference coding** or **different variable definitions** (e.g., “black” dummy might be reversed, or race is coded differently).
- The Conservative Protestant gap (0.118** vs 0.059) suggests the **religion classification** differs from the authors’ definition.

Concretely:
1. Recreate each dummy exactly as the paper: confirm baseline category (likely White, non-Hispanic; non–Conservative Protestant; non-South; male, etc.).
2. Rebuild race/ethnicity mutually exclusive categories the same way the authors did (common pitfall: treating Hispanic as race vs ethnicity; double-counting; not making categories mutually exclusive).
3. Recompute standardized betas *after* final coding and *within* the correct estimation sample.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated beta_std | True beta | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.152** | -0.151** | **Match (essentially exact)** |
| Income pc | -0.057 (ns) | -0.009 (ns) | **Mismatch** |
| Occ prestige | 0.067 (ns) | -0.022 (ns) | **Mismatch (sign flip)** |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.095* | **Mismatch** |
| Age | 0.002 (ns) | 0.110* | **Major mismatch** |
| Black | -0.118 (ns) | 0.049 (ns) | **Mismatch (sign flip)** |
| Hispanic | 0.072 (ns) | 0.031 (ns) | **Mismatch** |
| Other race | 0.001 (ns) | 0.053 (ns) | **Mismatch** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.095* | 0.066 (ns) | **Mismatch (sig)** |
| No religion | 0.015 (ns) | 0.024 (ns) | **Mismatch** |
| Southern | 0.080 (.) | 0.121** | **Mismatch (size + sig)** |
| Political intolerance | 0.151** | 0.164*** | **Mismatch (size + sig)** |

**Fix**
- Again, **Age** mismatch is the clearest signal something fundamental differs in coding/sample/standardization.
- Political intolerance differs in magnitude and significance; this often comes from:
  1) different scale construction (sum vs mean; number of items; reverse coding),
  2) different missing-data rule (how many items required), or
  3) different year/weighting.

Given your diagnostics show `Tol_min_answered` and `tol_items_answered_mean` etc., you likely constructed the intolerance scale yourself—but apparently **not in the same way** as the published table.

Action items:
1. Replicate the paper’s scale construction rules exactly (minimum answered items, rescaling, reverse-codes).
2. Match the paper’s **listwise deletion rules** for Model 3 (your N differs; see below).
3. Apply the same standardization procedure.

---

## C) Standard errors: your table prints SEs but Table 1 does not

### C1) Standard errors should not appear (and can’t be compared)
**Generated table1_style** prints lines that look like SEs under each coefficient.  
**True Results:** explicitly states Table 1 prints **no standard errors**.

**Fix**
- Remove SEs from the formatted Table 1 output if your goal is to match the PDF.
- If you still want SEs for your own appendix, label it as a separate table and do not imply it matches Table 1.

### C2) Your printed SEs are unlabeled and ambiguous
Even if SEs were allowed, the table has a formatting issue: coefficient rows are not labeled with variable names at all, making it impossible to verify which SE corresponds to which regressor.

**Fix**
- Include a variable-name column in `table1_style`, with one row per variable.
- Ensure the standard errors (if included) are clearly in parentheses and aligned.

---

## D) Fit statistics and sample size mismatches (major)

### D1) N is completely different in every model
| Model | Generated N | True N | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Model 1 | 1242 | 787 | **Mismatch** |
| Model 2 | 790 | 756 | **Mismatch** |
| Model 3 | 532 | 503 | **Mismatch** |

This alone guarantees coefficients won’t match exactly.

**Fix**
- Identify why your sample is larger (Model 1) and slightly larger (Models 2/3). Common causes:
  1) you are using a different survey year or pooling multiple years; your diagnostics show `N_year_1993 = 1606`, but you still may be including cases the authors excluded (age restrictions, valid-response filters, etc.).
  2) your DV inclusion rule differs: you have `DV_music_min_answered = 12` and `N_DV_strict_complete_18 = 893`, implying a multi-item DV construction; the authors may have required a different threshold or a different set of items.
  3) you may be handling “don’t know / refused / inapplicable” differently than the original authors.

To fix:
- Reproduce the paper’s **exact inclusion/exclusion** criteria and missing-value handling before estimating models.
- Then verify that listwise N equals **787 / 756 / 503** before comparing coefficients.

---

### D2) R² and Adjusted R² do not match
| Model | Generated R² | True R² | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Model 1 | 0.080 | 0.107 | **Mismatch** |
| Model 2 | 0.095 | 0.151 | **Mismatch** |
| Model 3 | 0.088 | 0.169 | **Mismatch** |

**Fix**
- Once you correct sample definition, coding, and scale construction, R² should move toward the published values.
- Also confirm whether the paper used **weights**. Your `fit_stats` says `weighted = False`. If the original used survey weights, unweighted R² and coefficients can differ.

---

### D3) Constants do not match
| Model | Generated constant | True constant | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Model 1 | 10.052 | 10.920 | **Mismatch** |
| Model 2 | 8.969 | 8.507 | **Mismatch** |
| Model 3 | 7.078 | 6.516 | **Mismatch** |

**Fix**
- Constants are very sensitive to:
  - sample differences,
  - coding differences (e.g., age scale),
  - whether DV is constructed/scaled differently,
  - and whether standardized vs unstandardized models are being reported.
- Table 1 prints standardized coefficients but also prints a constant; that implies they estimated on the unstandardized DV (and possibly unstandardized X) and then reported standardized betas separately. You need to mimic their exact procedure:
  - estimate unstandardized model to get the constant (and maybe unstandardized b),
  - compute standardized betas consistently,
  - print constant from the unstandardized model.

Right now your “table1_style” appears to mix pieces inconsistently (unlabeled SEs + standardized betas + raw constant).

---

## E) Interpretation / model construction mismatches

### E1) You are not replicating Table 1’s exact model setup
The “True Results” note: standardized coefficients only, no SEs. Your output combines:
- standardized betas (`beta_std`),
- unstandardized coefficients (`b_raw` in the long table),
- SE-like numbers printed in table1_style,
- plus a constant.

This is not how Table 1 is constructed.

**Fix**
- Decide on **one** replication target:
  1) **PDF Table 1 replication**: print standardized betas only (+ constant, R², Adj R², N), no SEs.
  2) **Your own regression table**: print b, SE, p, etc., but then you are no longer matching Table 1.

### E2) DV and political intolerance scale construction likely differs
Your diagnostics imply you used item counts/thresholds for DV and tolerance items. The published table’s N (and your coefficient patterns, especially Age) suggest you did not implement the same scoring/missing rules.

**Fix**
- From the paper/codebook, extract:
  - exact list of items in “number of music genres disliked”
  - how “disliked” is coded
  - required number of answered items
  - how “don’t know/refused” treated
  - whether the DV is a sum, count, or mean and its range
- Do the same for political intolerance:
  - exact items
  - reverse coding (if any)
  - scale range
  - missing rule (e.g., require all items vs allow some missing)

### E3) Weights / survey design (possible)
Your output explicitly shows `weighted=False`. If the paper used weights (common in GSS-type analyses), that will shift coefficients and standard errors and can affect N if weights are missing for some cases.

**Fix**
- Check the PDF methods section: if weights were used, re-estimate with the same weight variable and (if applicable) design corrections.
- Even if Table 1 prints standardized coefficients, they might be based on weighted estimation.

---

## Summary: every “must-fix” to make generated match true Table 1

1. **Match the estimation sample** so N equals **787 / 756 / 503** (your biggest divergence).
2. **Rebuild DV and political intolerance scales** using the paper’s exact item list, coding, and missingness rules.
3. **Recode demographics** to match the paper (race/ethnicity mutual exclusivity + reference categories; religion category definition).
4. **Fix age** coding/standardization (your age effect is dramatically off in Models 2–3).
5. **Apply weights** if the paper used them.
6. **Format output like Table 1**: standardized coefficients only; remove SEs; keep constant/R²/Adj R²/N.

If you paste (or upload an image of) the PDF’s notes on variable coding/sample restrictions (often in an appendix or methods section), I can tell you exactly which of your construction rules (DV min answered, tolerance min answered, race/ethnicity coding, etc.) must change to hit the published N and coefficients.
