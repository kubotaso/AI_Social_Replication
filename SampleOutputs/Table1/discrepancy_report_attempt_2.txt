============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: N, R², Adj. R² all mismatch

| Model | Generated N | True N | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| SES | 793 | 787 | Use the same sample restriction as the paper (listwise deletion on variables in Model 1). Your pipeline likely used a different missing-data rule (e.g., pairwise deletion or different recodes). |
| Demographic | 495 | 756 | Major mismatch: you’re fitting Model 2 on a much smaller subset. Ensure Model 2 includes the full set of covariates (incl. Hispanic, no religion), and apply listwise deletion **only after** those variables are constructed correctly. |
| Political intolerance | 276 | 503 | Same issue: you’re dropping far too many cases—likely because `polintol` (or another variable) is mis-coded with many missings, or you inadvertently restricted to a subsample. |

| Model | Generated R² | True R² | Generated Adj R² | True Adj R² | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| SES | 0.1076 | 0.107 | 0.1042 | 0.104 | This is close; differences likely from N mismatch / rounding. Fix N and it should align. |
| Demographic | 0.2037 | 0.151 | 0.1889 | 0.139 | Big discrepancy because your Model 2 is not the same model and/or not the same sample. Add missing predictors and fix sample construction. |
| Political intolerance | 0.2110 | 0.169 | 0.1812 | 0.148 | Same: wrong model and wrong sample. |

**How to fix (stats):**
- Recreate *exactly* the paper’s model-specific estimation samples: for each model, subset to cases non-missing on **all variables in that model**, after recoding.
- Verify you’re using the same dependent variable coding (“number of music genres disliked”) and same scaling.
- Ensure you’re not inadvertently filtering (e.g., complete cases across *all* variables for *all* models, which can shrink Model 2/3 too much—or the opposite: using inconsistent rules).

### 2) Variable-name and variable-inclusion mismatches

#### A. Hispanic is missing from generated outputs (Model 2 and 3)
**True table includes:** `Hispanic` (Model 2, Model 3)  
**Generated shows:** no Hispanic row at all.

**Fix:**
- Add the Hispanic indicator to Model 2 and Model 3 formulas.
- Ensure the race/ethnicity dummies match the paper’s construction (e.g., Hispanic as its own dummy, not folded into “other_race”).

#### B. “No religion” is missing from generated outputs (Model 2 and 3)
**True table includes:** `No religion` (Model 2, Model 3)  
**Generated shows:** no such term.

**Fix:**
- Add a `no_religion` dummy (or equivalent) to Model 2 and 3.
- Confirm the reference category for religion matches the paper (because coefficient meaning depends on the omitted group).

#### C. “other_race” is present, but you may be coding race differently than the paper
The paper has **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race** (and implicitly a reference group, likely White non-Hispanic).
Your generated set has **black** and **other_race** but no **hispanic**.

**Fix:**
- Rebuild mutually exclusive categories consistent with the paper:
  - `black` dummy
  - `hispanic` dummy
  - `other_race` dummy
  - reference: White non-Hispanic
- Then refit.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below, I compare the generated standardized coefficients to the printed standardized coefficients.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated βstd | True βstd | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.3297*** | -0.322*** | small numeric mismatch (likely sample/N differences) |
| inc_pc | -0.0336 | -0.037 | small mismatch |
| prestg80 | 0.0291 | 0.016 | moderate mismatch (could be sample/coding) |

**Fix:** get N to 787 and confirm variable coding (especially occupational prestige measure and any top-coding/missing handling).

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Term | Generated βstd | True βstd | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.2928*** | -0.246*** | sizable |
| inc_pc | -0.0565 | -0.054 | close |
| prestg80 | 0.0376 | -0.006 | sign mismatch |
| female | -0.0808* | -0.083* | close |
| age | 0.1746*** | 0.140*** | sizable |
| black | 0.0586 | 0.029 | sizable |
| other_race | 0.0088 | 0.005 | close |
| conserv_prot | 0.0590 | 0.059 | matches |
| south | 0.1420*** | 0.097** | sizable |
| **hispanic** | (missing) | -0.029 | omitted variable |
| **no religion** | (missing) | -0.012 | omitted variable |

Two major problems are evident:
1) **Omitted variables** (Hispanic, No religion) ⇒ your coefficients are not comparable to the printed model.
2) **Sample size is wildly off (495 vs 756)** ⇒ even with correct formula, estimates won’t match.

**Fix:**
- Add the two omitted variables.
- Recompute model-specific complete-case sample (should be 756).
- Then rerun standardized OLS.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | Generated βstd | True βstd | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.1734* | -0.151** | magnitude + significance mismatch |
| inc_pc | -0.0368 | -0.009 | sizable |
| prestg80 | 0.0191 | -0.022 | sign mismatch |
| female | -0.0955 | -0.095* | coefficient matches, but your sig marking differs |
| age | 0.1532* | 0.110* | sizable |
| black | 0.0906 | 0.049 | sizable |
| other_race | 0.0651 | 0.053 | close-ish |
| conserv_prot | 0.0344 | 0.066 | sizable |
| south | 0.1565** | 0.121** | sizable |
| polintol | 0.1595* | 0.164*** | significance mismatch (and slightly smaller) |
| **hispanic** | (missing) | 0.031 | omitted |
| **no religion** | (missing) | 0.024 | omitted |

Again:
- **Model misspecification** (missing Hispanic, No religion).
- **Huge N mismatch** (276 vs 503), likely due to a bad `polintol` construction or aggressive missing filtering.

**Fix:**
- Construct `polintol` exactly as in the paper (same items, same scaling, same missing handling).
- Add Hispanic + No religion.
- Ensure Model 3 sample is 503 via listwise deletion on Model 3 variables only.

### 4) Standard errors: generated SEs exist, but the “true” table has none

**Mismatch type:** not a numerical disagreement—this is a *reporting mismatch*.  
The paper’s Table 1 prints **standardized coefficients only** and **does not provide SEs**. Your generated SEs therefore cannot be “matched” to Table 1.

**Fix options (choose one depending on your goal):**
1) **To match the paper’s table:** remove SEs from the output and print only standardized betas + significance stars.
2) **If you must report SEs:** derive them from the underlying regression (unstandardized) and state clearly these SEs are **not** from the PDF’s Table 1 and may use conventional vs robust SEs. But then you are no longer reproducing Table 1 “as printed”.

---

### 5) Constant term is on the wrong scale (and should not be standardized)

**Generated coefficients_long shows:** `const` ≈ 0 with tiny SEs and p=1.  
**True table shows constants:** 10.920, 8.507, 6.516 (unstandardized intercepts).

This indicates you likely:
- standardized **all columns including the dependent variable**, and then ran OLS, producing an intercept ~0; and/or
- you’re reporting a “standardized intercept,” which is not what Table 1 prints.

**Fix:**
- Reproduce Table 1’s behavior:
  - Use **standardized coefficients** for predictors (and/or use software to compute βs), **but keep the intercept unstandardized** (or just print the intercept from the unstandardized model).
- Practically: fit the model on **raw y** and raw X, then compute standardized betas post-estimation:
  \[
  \beta^{std}_j = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
  \]
  while keeping intercept = \(b_0\) from the unstandardized model.
- Alternatively, if you standardize variables: standardize **predictors only**, not y, if you want an interpretable intercept (though it still won’t equal the paper’s intercept unless you replicate their exact method).

---

### 6) Significance stars / interpretation mismatches

Because your N is wrong and your model omits variables, the p-values/stars won’t align. Specific examples:
- **Model 3 political intolerance:** generated `polintol` is only `*` (p≈0.010) but true table has `***`. That’s a major discrepancy driven by sample size/model differences and/or different SE computation.
- **Model 3 education:** generated `*` but true is `**`.
- **Model 2 south:** generated `***` but true is `**`.

**Fix:**
- First fix the **model specification** (add Hispanic, no religion).
- Then fix **sample sizes** to match.
- Then ensure you’re using the same **standard error convention** as the paper (very likely conventional OLS SEs unless stated otherwise; if you used robust/clustered SEs, stars will differ).
- Finally, apply the same star thresholds (paper: * .05, ** .01, *** .001 two-tailed).

---

### 7) Regression table formatting/order mismatch (minor but real)

Your `regression_table` has unlabeled rows (just numbers and NaNs). The true table has labeled variables in a specific order and includes additional rows.

**Fix:**
- Print row labels matching Table 1 exactly:
  Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Political intolerance, Constant, R², Adj R², N.
- Ensure the same ordering and missing entries shown as em-dash (—), not NaN.

## Summary of required corrections to make generated match true

1) **Correct the model formulas**
- Model 2 and 3 must include **Hispanic** and **No religion**.

2) **Reconstruct variables to match the paper**
- Race/ethnicity dummies must be mutually exclusive with the same reference group.
- `polintol` must be computed identically (same items/scoring).

3) **Use model-specific listwise deletion**
- Target N: 787 (M1), 756 (M2), 503 (M3).

4) **Standardization/reporting**
- Report **standardized coefficients** for predictors.
- Do **not** report a “standardized constant”; use the unstandardized intercept if you want to match Table 1.
- Do not try to “match” SEs because Table 1 does not provide them; either omit SEs or clearly mark them as additional.

If you share your model formulas / code (or at least the variable construction steps for `hispanic`, `no religion`, and `polintol`), I can point to the exact line(s) that are causing the N collapse and coefficient sign flips (notably `prestg80` in Models 2–3).
