Score: 6/100
============================================================

### 1) Fundamental apples-to-oranges problem (standardized vs unstandardized)
**True table reports standardized coefficients (β) for predictors**, and **no standard errors**. Your generated tables report **unstandardized b**, **SE**, **t**, **p**, plus a `beta_std` column.

- **Mismatch:** You (implicitly) compare `b` to the paper’s β. Those will not match in magnitude, and sometimes even in sign if coding differs (see below).
- **Fix:** To match the paper, you must:
  1) **Report only standardized coefficients for predictors** (your `beta_std`) and
  2) **Suppress SE/t/p** (or compute them but don’t present them as if they are in the paper).
  3) Ensure the **dependent variable** is the same and coded the same (see §4).

### 2) Fit statistics: N, R², adj. R² all mismatch (Models 2–3 are wildly off)
#### Model 1
- **N:** Generated 793 vs True 787 (**mismatch**)
- **R²/Adj R²:** Generated 0.1076 / 0.1042 vs True 0.107 / 0.104 (**close**)

**Likely cause:** different missing-data handling or sample restrictions (e.g., listwise deletion done differently; different recodes creating additional missingness in the paper).

**Fix:** Reproduce the paper’s sample definition and listwise deletion rules. Use the same year (GSS 1993), same age restrictions (if any), and same construction of the DV and all predictors. Then do **listwise deletion on the exact model variables**.

#### Model 2
- **N:** Generated **37** vs True **756** (catastrophic mismatch)
- **R²:** Generated 0.489 vs True 0.151 (large mismatch)
- **Adj R²:** Generated 0.343 vs True 0.139 (large mismatch)

**Likely causes (strong evidence from your coefficients):**
- Your race/religion dummy variables are causing **perfect collinearity / zero-variance / empty categories**, producing `0` coefficients and `NaN` SEs (see §3).
- Something in your pipeline is **dropping almost all cases** (e.g., using `dropna()` after constructing a variable with many missings; or merging incorrectly; or filtering to a tiny subgroup).
  
**Fix:**
- Audit each variable’s missingness **before** regression (counts of non-missing).
- Confirm that your model frame has ~756 rows for Model 2 after listwise deletion.
- Ensure categorical recodes don’t turn most observations into missing (e.g., using wrong codes for “don’t know,” “refused,” “inapplicable”).
- Use proper factor coding with a reference category (don’t manually create dummies that accidentally create empty columns).

#### Model 3
- **N:** Generated **19** vs True **503** (catastrophic mismatch)
- **R²:** Generated 0.588 vs True 0.169 (large mismatch)
- **Adj R²:** Generated 0.176 vs True 0.148 (mismatch)

**Likely causes:** same as Model 2, plus `pol_intol` likely has massive missingness due to incorrect construction.

**Fix:** Reconstruct political intolerance exactly as in the original paper (items used, coding direction, how missing handled). Then confirm resulting N≈503 after listwise deletion.

### 3) Variable-level mismatches: coefficients/signs, NaNs, and impossible estimates
#### A) NaN / zero columns indicate broken dummy coding
In Model 2 and/or 3 you have:
- `otherrace` = 0 with SE=0 and t/p=NaN (Model 2)
- `norelig` = 0 with SE=0 and NaN (Models 2–3)
- `hispanic` essentially ~0 with absurdly tiny SE and `beta_std=NaN` (Models 2–3)

These are **not “true zeros”**; they indicate the regressor is **constant, empty, or perfectly collinear**.

**Fix:**
- Create race and religion variables as **categorical factors** and let the model handle contrasts, *or* if using dummies:
  - Verify each dummy has both 0 and 1 values.
  - Ensure you **omit one reference category** per set (race: white as reference; religion: mainline/other as reference, etc.).
- Check you didn’t filter the data so that, e.g., no “other race” cases remain (which would make the dummy all zeros).

#### B) Standardized coefficients (β) do not match the true table
Below I compare your **`beta_std`** to the paper’s β (since that’s the correct comparison).

##### Model 1
- educ: generated β = **-0.3297** vs true **-0.322*** (close)
- inc_pc: generated β = **-0.0336** vs true **-0.037** (close)
- prestg80: generated β = **0.0291** vs true **0.016** (noticeable mismatch)

Also your **intercept** is 10.833 vs true 10.920 (small mismatch; intercepts are unstandardized in the paper).

**Fix:** likely minor differences in:
- prestige variable coding (e.g., `prestg80` scale or missing codes),
- income per capita computation,
- sample N (793 vs 787).
Get exact recodes and listwise deletion to tighten these.

##### Model 2 (many sign mismatches vs the paper)
Compare generated `beta_std` to true β:

- educ: **-0.796** vs **-0.246*** (**major mismatch**)
- inc_pc: **+0.182** vs **-0.054** (**wrong sign**)
- prestg80: **+0.425** vs **-0.006** (**wrong sign, huge magnitude**)
- female: **+0.077** vs **-0.083*** (**wrong sign**)
- age: **-0.018** vs **+0.140*** (**wrong sign**)
- south: **+0.224** vs **+0.097** (too large)
- cons_prot: **+0.320** vs **+0.059** (too large)
- black: **+0.025** vs **+0.029** (close)
- hispanic/otherrace/norelig: broken (NaNs/zeros)

Given N=37, these coefficients are not comparable at all.

**Fix:** once N is corrected to ~756 and dummies are valid, these should move toward the published values. Also verify:
- **female coding direction** (paper likely: female=1; your sign suggests maybe male=1 or reversed outcome)
- **age** (should be positive in true results; your negative suggests outcome reversed or age miscoded)
- **income per capita**: ensure it’s *per capita* and scaled similarly (paper may use log or specific divisor)

##### Model 3 (even more inconsistent)
Compare generated `beta_std` vs true β:
- educ: **-0.284** vs **-0.151** (too negative)
- inc_pc: **+0.207** vs **-0.009** (wrong sign)
- prestg80: **+0.511** vs **-0.022** (wrong sign)
- female: **+0.206** vs **-0.095** (wrong sign)
- age: **+0.148** vs **+0.110*** (close-ish)
- south: **+0.218** vs **+0.121** (too large)
- pol_intol: **+0.313** vs **+0.164*** (too large)
- again: Hispanic / norelig issues

But with N=19, everything is unstable.

**Fix:** Same as Model 2 plus correct `pol_intol` construction and restore N≈503.

### 4) Interpretation mismatches you should correct in the write-up
Because the paper reports **standardized β**, the correct interpretation is:

- “A 1 SD increase in X is associated with a β SD change in the number of genres disliked.”

Your generated output tempts interpretation in raw units (because you emphasize `b` and SE). Also, in Models 2–3 your signs conflict with the paper (female, age, prestige, income), so any narrative based on them would be wrong.

**Fix to interpretation section:**
- Base interpretation on `beta_std` only (after you’ve fixed the sample and coding).
- Match the paper’s sign/direction (e.g., female negative in Models 2–3, age positive, prestige slightly negative, etc.).
- Do not report SEs as if you are reproducing Table 1; label them as “computed from replication” only if you truly replicate and want to add them.

---

### 5) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the true table
1) **Recreate the exact analytic samples**:
   - Model 1 N≈787; Model 2 N≈756; Model 3 N≈503.
   - Use **listwise deletion per model** on exactly the variables in that model.

2) **Ensure the DV matches**: “Number of music genres disliked” (same items, same counting rule, same missing handling).

3) **Recode categorical variables correctly**:
   - Race: create dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race with **White as reference**; verify each dummy has nonzero variance.
   - Religion: conservative Protestant and no religion defined exactly as the paper; ensure not collinear with the constant and other religion categories.

4) **Fix political intolerance**:
   - Use the same index/items and direction; handle DK/NA as missing the same way; confirm it doesn’t collapse N to ~19.

5) **Standardize predictors** (to match Table 1):
   - Either z-score X’s before regression, or compute standardized betas from the fitted model using the same method as the paper.
   - Report β for predictors; keep constant unstandardized.

6) **Remove/ignore AIC/BIC** in the “match” claim:
   - The paper doesn’t report them; including them is fine, but they’re not part of the replication target.

If you want, paste your code (or at least how you constructed `inc_pc`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `pol_intol`, and how you filtered to 1993), and I can pinpoint the exact step that collapses N to 37/19 and flips the key signs.
