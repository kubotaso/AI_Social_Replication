Score: 45/100
============================================================

### A) Table formatting / what is being compared
**Mismatch 0 (fundamental): standard errors are shown in the Generated table but the True table does not report them.**  
- **Generated:** Table prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like an SE.  
- **True:** The PDF table reports **standardized coefficients only** and **no SEs**.
- **Fix:** To match the True output, **do not print SEs** (or replace them with blanks/“—”). If you want SEs, you must compute them from the data, but then you are no longer matching the PDF table.

---

## B) Variable-name mismatches (and omission/coding problems)

### 1) Income variable name
- **Generated term:** `income_pc`
- **True label:** “Household income per capita”
- **Status:** Mostly just a labeling mismatch (same concept), **but also see coefficient mismatch below**.
- **Fix:** Rename in the table output to match the PDF label (or map `income_pc -> Household income per capita`).

### 2) Occupational prestige variable name
- **Generated term:** `prestg80`
- **True label:** “Occupational prestige”
- **Fix:** Map `prestg80 -> Occupational prestige`.

### 3) Race/ethnicity coding: Hispanic is missing/NaN in generated models
- **Generated:** `hispanic` shows `NaN` beta and p-value in Models 2 and 3; table shows “—” row (non-estimable).
- **True:** Hispanic is included with coefficients:
  - Demographic: **-0.029**
  - Political intolerance: **0.031**
- **Interpretation of mismatch:** Your generated pipeline effectively **dropped/failed to estimate** the Hispanic parameter (likely perfect collinearity, all zeros, or coding error).
- **Fix:**
  1. Ensure `hispanic` is a **0/1 indicator** with variation in the estimation sample.
  2. Avoid creating mutually exclusive race dummies that sum to 1 **and** also including an intercept without dropping a reference category. Correct approaches:
     - Use one categorical race variable with a reference group, e.g. `C(race)`; or
     - Include dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race **and leave White as the omitted reference** (do not include a `white` dummy).
  3. Confirm Hispanic cases are not all lost due to listwise deletion rules.

### 4) Conservative Protestant definition likely mismatched
- **Generated rule:** `RELIG==1 and DENOM in {1,6,7}; missing if Protestant and DENOM missing`
- **True table:** “Conservative Protestant” (no coefficient significance stars in Model 2, small positive)
- **Why this is a discrepancy risk:** If your denomination mapping differs from the author’s, you will shift both coefficients and sample size.
- **Fix:** Reconstruct Conservative Protestant **exactly as the article/PDF defines it** (often derived from a RELTRAD scheme or specific denominational families). Do not improvise a DENOM set unless it is documented as the same.

## C) Coefficient mismatches (by model)

Below I list **every coefficient mismatch** between Generated and True (standardized betas).

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.310*** | -0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| HH income pc | -0.038 | -0.037 | essentially matches (rounding) |
| Occ prestige | 0.025 | 0.016 | too large |

**Fix(es):**
- The education/prestige differences are modest but systematic; most likely due to **sample mismatch** (your N differs: 748 vs 787) and/or **DV construction mismatch** (see Section E).
- Match the **exact listwise deletion rules used in the paper** and the **exact DV coding**.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.243*** | -0.246*** | very close (ok) |
| HH income pc | -0.043 | -0.054 | noticeably off |
| Occ prestige | -0.000 | -0.006 | off |
| Female | -0.078* | -0.083* | close |
| Age | 0.114** | 0.140*** | too small + wrong stars |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.029 | matches |
| Hispanic | NaN/— | -0.029 | **missing entirely** |
| Other race | 0.004 | 0.005 | close |
| Cons Protestant | 0.087* | 0.059 | too large + wrong stars |
| No religion | -0.006 | -0.012 | off |
| Southern | 0.070 (p≈.058) | 0.097** | too small + wrong stars |

**Fix(es):**
- **Hispanic must be estimable** (see B3).
- Age and Southern being too small + reduced significance is consistent with **measurement differences** (age coding, region coding, or different sample) and with **different standardization method** (see Section F).
- Conservative Protestant is likely **defined differently** (B4).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.121* | -0.151** | too small + wrong stars |
| HH income pc | -0.035 | -0.009 | substantially off |
| Occ prestige | -0.001 | -0.022 | off |
| Female | -0.103* | -0.095* | close |
| Age | 0.086 (p≈.066) | 0.110* | too small + wrong stars |
| Black | 0.064 | 0.049 | off |
| Hispanic | NaN/— | 0.031 | **missing entirely** |
| Other race | 0.050 | 0.053 | close |
| Cons Protestant | 0.082 | 0.066 | off |
| No religion | 0.014 | 0.024 | off |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.121** | much too small + wrong stars |
| Political intolerance | 0.174*** | 0.164*** | close-ish but high |

**Fix(es):**
- Again: **sample mismatch** (476 vs 503), **DV mismatch**, **political intolerance scale construction mismatch**, plus **Hispanic omission**.

---

## D) Model fit and sample size mismatches (these drive coefficient differences)

### Sample sizes
- **True:** N = 787, 756, 503
- **Generated:** N = 748, 705, 476
- **Fix:** Your listwise deletion is stricter than the paper’s.

Concretely, your diagnostics say:  
- DV rule: “strict complete-case across all 18 music items; dislike=4/5; sum to 0–18”
- Pol intolerance rule: “require >=10 answered; prorated sum …”

Those rules almost certainly do **not** match the authors’ inclusion rules.

### R² and Adjusted R²
- **True:** R² = 0.107 / 0.151 / 0.169; Adj R² = 0.104 / 0.139 / 0.148
- **Generated:** R² = 0.097 / 0.128 / 0.132; Adj R² = 0.094 / 0.116 / 0.112
- **Fix:** Once the **same sample** and **same variable constructions** are used, R² should move toward the published values. Right now you’re (a) dropping more cases and (b) likely adding measurement noise by recoding.

---

## E) Dependent variable construction mismatch (very likely)

- **Generated DV rule:** “strict complete-case across all 18 music items; dislike=4/5; sum to 0–18”
- **True DV:** “Number of music genres disliked” (paper-specific; does not necessarily require complete data on all items, and may define “dislike” differently)

**Why it matters:** Your complete-case requirement alone can explain much of the N shortfall (893 DV-complete, then down to 748 with SES vars; but the paper has 787 in Model 1—i.e., they retained more). They likely **allow some item-missingness** (e.g., count dislikes among answered items, maybe with a minimum answered threshold), or they use a prebuilt index variable.

**Fix:**
1. Check whether the dataset already contains a constructed “genres disliked” index (use that directly).
2. If constructing:
   - Match the paper’s “dislike” threshold (may not be 4/5; could be top-box only, etc.).
   - Match missing-data rule (e.g., “if responded to at least X genres, compute count” or “treat missing as not disliked” if that’s what the authors did—only if explicitly stated).
3. Do **not** require complete responses on all 18 unless the paper says so.

---

## F) Standardization method mismatch (possible contributor)

- **Generated betas rule:** “OLS on z-scored DV and z-scored predictors within each model estimation sample”
- **True table:** “Standardized OLS coefficients” (often computed as **unstandardized b × SD(X)/SD(Y)** from the same estimation sample, which is equivalent if done consistently, but differences can occur if:
  - standardization was done on a different sample (e.g., full analysis sample, not model-by-model),
  - weights were used,
  - complex survey design corrections were used,
  - or dummy variables were not standardized the same way.)

**Fix:**
1. Verify whether the article uses **weights** (common in GSS-style work). If yes, use weighted standard deviations and weighted regression.
2. Standardize exactly as the authors did:
   - either standardize variables before regression using the same sample/weights,
   - or compute post-hoc standardized betas from the fitted model and the sample SDs used by the authors.

---

## G) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Because your coefficients and especially **N** differ, your p-values and stars differ too (e.g., Age: **True 0.140*** vs Generated 0.114**; Southern: **True 0.097** vs Generated ~0.070†). That’s not a “reporting error” so much as a consequence of the mismatched analysis.

**Fix:** After you match:
- the estimation sample (N),
- DV construction,
- Hispanic estimability,
- Conservative Protestant coding,
- and any weights/design,
the stars should align closely. If the PDF used robust SEs or survey-corrected SEs, you must also use the same variance estimator.

---

## H) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the True table

1. **Stop printing SEs** in Table 1 output (True table has none).
2. **Rebuild DV** to match the paper:
   - same “dislike” coding,
   - same handling of item missingness,
   - same range/scaling.
3. **Match inclusion rules / listwise deletion** used by the authors (your complete-case rule is too strict).
4. **Fix race/ethnicity coding** so `hispanic` is estimated (choose a reference category correctly).
5. **Recode Conservative Protestant** using the article’s definition (not an ad hoc DENOM set).
6. **Use the same weighting/design** (if the paper used weights, apply them).
7. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way** as the paper (and on the same sample).

If you paste (or summarize) the paper’s exact variable construction notes (especially DV and political intolerance index + any weights), I can translate them into exact “do-this-not-that” recoding rules and identify which of your diagnostic rules must change line-by-line.
