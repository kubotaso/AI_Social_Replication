Score: 25/100
============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics: **all three models mismatch** (n, R², adj. R²)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **n**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** You’re dropping ~40 extra cases. Recreate the paper’s analytic sample and listwise-deletion rules. Most likely you (a) used a different year range, (b) included extra missingness filters (e.g., for demographics not in Model 1), or (c) mishandled “Don’t know/NA” codes as missing for variables not in the model.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.088 / 0.085**
  - True: **0.107 / 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the **sample** matches (n=787) and you are using the same variables/coding, R² should move toward the paper’s values. If it still doesn’t, you likely have **coding differences** (see sections below) or you are computing standardized coefficients but fitting on different raw variables.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **n**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is a major discrepancy—suggests you are unintentionally imposing missingness from variables that are *not* in the paper’s Model 2 (e.g., political intolerance, genres, etc.), or you have recoded a major variable (notably **hispanic** shows 35% missing in your missingness table, which is implausibly high for a simple race/ethnicity indicator).

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.135 / 0.118**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Match sample (n=756) + ensure “Other race” is included (yours is dropped/NaN) + match coding of Hispanic and Southern.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **n**
  - Generated: **334**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Again, excessive case loss. Your `pol_intol` shows **36% missing**; that alone could reduce n, but your n is even lower than that implies once combined with other variables. You likely:
  - restricted to respondents who answered *all music genre items* (DV construction) differently than the paper, and/or
  - treated “not asked” / “inapplicable” codes as missing incorrectly.

- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.136 / 0.106**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Match n and variable coding; political intolerance effect size is close but not identical (see below), and several other coefficients are off in sign/magnitude, which will depress R².

---

## 2) Variable presence / names: **“Other race” is missing in generated Models 2–3**

- Generated tables show:
  - `otherrace` is listed as a **dropped predictor**
  - coefficient is **blank/NaN** in Models 2 and 3
- True results: “Other race” has **nonzero β** in both models (0.005 in M2; 0.053 in M3)

**Fix**
1. Ensure `otherrace` is not perfectly collinear with your intercept + race dummies. Common mistakes:
   - creating **all** race dummies (Black, Hispanic, Other) **without a reference category** (e.g., White omitted). If “White” is not omitted, you’ll have perfect multicollinearity.
2. Confirm “Hispanic” is not coded as a race category in one place and ethnicity in another such that categories overlap incorrectly.

---

## 3) Coefficients (β): term-by-term mismatches

Below I compare the **standardized coefficients (β)** because that’s what the paper reports (your `table1_panel` appears to be β, not raw b).

### Model 1 (SES): **all coefficients and constant mismatch**
- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.638**
  - True: **10.920**
  - Fix: constant depends on unstandardized model and sample; match sample (n) + coding.

- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.292***  
  - True β: **-0.322***  
  - Fix: likely sample/coding. Also check education scaling (years vs degree categories converted improperly).

- **Income per capita**
  - Generated β: **-0.039**
  - True β: **-0.037**
  - Fix: close; will likely align after sample/coding.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **0.020**
  - True β: **0.016**
  - Fix: small difference—again likely sample and prestige variable version (`prestg80_v` vs another prestige scale).

### Model 2 (Demographic): multiple mismatches + sign error for Hispanic
- **Constant**
  - Generated: **9.285**
  - True: **8.507**
  - Fix: sample/coding.

- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.264***  
  - True β: **-0.246***  
  - Fix: sample/coding.

- **Income**
  - Generated β: **-0.053**
  - True β: **-0.054**
  - Fix: essentially matches.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **-0.016**
  - True β: **-0.006**
  - Fix: sample/coding.

- **Female**
  - Generated β: **-0.090*** (your star is “*” in the full model; table panel shows -0.090*)
  - True β: **-0.083***
  - Fix: close; will adjust with correct n.

- **Age**
  - Generated β: **0.104*** (your star is “*”)
  - True β: **0.140*** (***)
  - Fix: big difference. Often due to:
    - using a **different age variable** (top-coded, age at interview vs derived),
    - restricting age range unintentionally,
    - sample mismatch.

- **Black**
  - Generated β: **0.043**
  - True β: **0.029**
  - Fix: sample/coding.

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated β: **+0.030**
  - True β: **-0.029**
  - **Mismatch in sign (interpretation changes).**
  - Fix: your `hispanic` variable is likely miscoded/reversed (1/0 flipped) or constructed with missing treated as 0. Your missingness table shows **35% missing** for `hispanic`, strongly suggesting a merge/recoding error. Use the original GSS Hispanic indicator and recode only explicit codes to 0/1; do not coerce NA to 0.

- **Other race**
  - Generated: **dropped/NaN**
  - True β: **0.005**
  - Fix: fix dummy trap / reference category as above.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated β: **0.090**
  - True β: **0.059**
  - Fix: denomination coding likely differs from the paper’s definition.

- **No religion**
  - Generated β: **-0.019**
  - True β: **-0.012**
  - Fix: small; sample/coding.

- **Southern**
  - Generated β: **0.063** (not significant)
  - True β: **0.097** (**)
  - Fix: southern coding or sample mismatch; also could reflect using a different region variable.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): several mismatches
- **Constant**
  - Generated: **7.034**
  - True: **6.516**
  - Fix: sample/coding.

- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.142*** (shown as -0.142*)
  - True β: **-0.151** (**)  
  - Fix: close; star level differs because your p-values/SEs differ and sample differs. But note: the paper’s stars are based on their SEs; your SEs will not replicate unless the model/sample matches.

- **Income**
  - Generated β: **-0.065**
  - True β: **-0.009**
  - **Large mismatch.**
  - Fix: likely you are using a different income-per-capita construction (or scaling), or your per-capita divisor differs (household size treatment). It could also be an artifact of your much smaller n=334.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **0.009**
  - True β: **-0.022**
  - **Mismatch in sign.**
  - Fix: prestige variable differs, or collinearity/sample differences flip it. Verify you’re using the same prestige measure as the paper and same sample.

- **Female**
  - Generated β: **-0.123*** (p<.05 in your output)
  - True β: **-0.095***  
  - Fix: sample/coding.

- **Age**
  - Generated β: **0.073** (ns)
  - True β: **0.110***  
  - Fix: age variable or sample mismatch.

- **Black**
  - Generated β: **0.064**
  - True β: **0.049**
  - Fix: sample/coding.

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated β: **0.014**
  - True β: **0.031**
  - Fix: plus your Model 2 sign mismatch suggests Hispanic coding problems overall.

- **Other race**
  - Generated: **dropped/NaN**
  - True β: **0.053**
  - Fix: dummy trap/reference category.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated β: **0.052**
  - True β: **0.066**
  - Fix: denomination coding.

- **No religion**
  - Generated β: **0.024**
  - True β: **0.024**
  - This one matches.

- **Southern**
  - Generated β: **0.072**
  - True β: **0.121** (**)
  - Fix: region coding/sample.

- **Political intolerance**
  - Generated β: **0.200*** (unstandardized b=0.1586)
  - True β: **0.164***  
  - Fix: your intolerance scale coding may differ (range, missing handling, item set), and sample mismatch inflates β.

---

## 4) Standard errors: generated SE/p-values are not comparable to “true” table

- True Table 1: **SEs not reported**; only β and stars.
- Your output includes p-values and stars from your own SEs.

**Fix**
- Do **not** claim SE mismatches relative to Table 1—there is nothing to compare.
- To match the paper, output **standardized β and significance stars only**, and be explicit that SEs are not shown (or compute them but do not present them as “paper-matching”).

---

## 5) Interpretation errors induced by coefficient/sign issues

- The biggest interpretation error is **Hispanic (Model 2)**:
  - Generated implies Hispanic respondents dislike *more* genres (β>0),
  - True implies they dislike *fewer* (β<0).
  - **Fix:** correct Hispanic coding and rerun.

- “Other race” being dropped means your generated narrative would incorrectly say it’s excluded or irrelevant. In the paper it is included (small in M2, larger in M3).  
  **Fix:** correct race dummy specification.

- Income effect in Model 3 is dramatically more negative in generated results (β=-0.065 vs -0.009). Any interpretation about income mattering in the political intolerance model would be wrong.  
  **Fix:** align inc-per-capita construction and sample.

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Rebuild the analytic sample to match n per model**
   - Use **GSS 1993** only (as the paper states).
   - Apply **listwise deletion within each model only** (Model 1 should not drop cases due to missing in race/region/intolerance).
   - Verify the DV (`num_genres_disliked`) is computed identically to the paper (same genre items, same coding of “dislike,” and missing handling).

2. **Fix race/ethnicity dummy coding**
   - Ensure one reference group (typically White, non-Hispanic).
   - Do not include redundant dummies.
   - Ensure `hispanic` is a clean 0/1 with correct direction and no accidental NA→0 conversion.

3. **Fix “Other race” not being estimated**
   - Diagnose multicollinearity (design matrix rank).
   - Drop one category or set proper contrasts.

4. **Align variable constructions**
   - `inc_pc`: confirm the paper’s equivalence scale / per-capita method and currency coding.
   - `educ_yrs`: ensure it is years (not degree codes).
   - `prestg80_v`: ensure it matches the paper’s occupational prestige measure.

5. **Report the same quantities**
   - Present **standardized β** for predictors and **unstandardized constant**, with stars.
   - Do not present SE comparisons to the paper table (not available).

If you share the exact code used to (a) construct `num_genres_disliked`, (b) construct `pol_intol`, and (c) generate race/ethnicity dummies, I can point to the specific line(s) causing the n collapse and the Hispanic/Other-race problems.
