============================================================

Below is a line-by-line comparison of the **Generated Results** vs the **True (paper Table 1) Results**, flagging **every mismatch** in (a) variable presence/names, (b) coefficients (standardized β and/or constants), (c) model fit stats / N, and (d) interpretation/significance. I then give concrete fixes so the generated analysis can match the paper.

## 1) Model fit statistics and sample size (N): mismatches

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Mismatch.**
- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, Adj R² = 0.085
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, Adj R² = 0.104
  - **Mismatch.**

**Fix**
1. Ensure you are using the **same analytic sample as the paper** (GSS 1993 + same inclusion rules).
2. Reproduce the paper’s **listwise deletion rules per model**. Your missingness table suggests large missingness in some demographics; if you’re incorrectly treating some values as missing (e.g., race), N will shrink.
3. Confirm the **dependent variable construction** matches the paper (“Number of Music Genres Disliked”)—coding differences can change R² even if N matched.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Mismatch (very large).**
- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.135 / 0.118**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Mismatch.**
- **Dropped predictor**
  - Generated: `otherrace` dropped (NaN coefficient)
  - True: `Other race` included with β = 0.005
  - **Mismatch.**

**Fix**
- The huge N drop is strongly consistent with **race variables being missing for many cases** in your constructed dataset. Your missingness table shows:
  - black/hispanic/otherrace each missing **~35%** (562 of 1606), which is not typical if race is coded correctly in the GSS extract.
- Most likely causes and fixes:
  1. **Race dummies were created from a variable that is missing for many respondents** (wrong year/variable, or a recode that turned valid values into NA).
     - Fix: build race dummies from the correct GSS race/ethnicity variables (and confirm their missingness is minimal).
  2. You accidentally set race to missing except for one subgroup (e.g., only coded “black==1” when race==2 and left everyone else NA rather than 0).
     - Fix: explicitly code **0/1 for all cases** with known race; set NA only when race itself is missing.
  3. You filtered to a subset (e.g., only cases with pol_intol) too early.
     - Fix: compute Model 2 on its own sample (listwise on its predictors only), not on Model 3’s restricted sample.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Mismatch.**
- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.145 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Mismatch.**
- **Dropped predictor**
  - Generated: `otherrace` dropped (NaN)
  - True: `Other race` included with β = 0.053
  - **Mismatch.**

**Fix**
- You have extreme missingness for `pol_intol` (~47%). That will reduce N, but **286 is still far below 503**, implying additional unnecessary missingness (again likely race coding and/or an incorrect merge/recode).
- Also ensure political intolerance is measured on the same scale and computed identically to the paper (your label says 0–15, which seems plausible—but the missingness and N mismatch suggest construction problems).

---

## 2) Variable names/presence: mismatches

### “Other race” / `otherrace` is effectively absent in Generated Models 2 & 3
- Generated shows:
  - `Other race` row is **NaN**
  - replication check: dummy_otherrace unique = **0** (i.e., all zeros)
  - predictor dropped because of no variance
- True shows:
  - Model 2: **Other race β = 0.005**
  - Model 3: **Other race β = 0.053**
  - i.e., it **must vary** and be included.

**Fix**
- Rebuild `otherrace` so it actually captures respondents not White/Black/Hispanic (depending on the paper’s scheme).
- Verify:
  - Frequency table of race categories
  - `otherrace` has both 0s and 1s
  - Dummies are mutually exclusive **and** cover the intended categories with a clear reference group (likely White, non-Hispanic).

## 3) Coefficients: standardized β (main target of Table 1) — mismatches

Important: the paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)**. Your generated tables include both **b** and **beta**. Comparisons should be on **beta** for predictors, and on **Constant** (unstandardized).

### Model 1 (SES): β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292** | **-0.322** | No |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | No (small) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | No (small) |
| Constant (unstd) | **10.638** | **10.920** | No |

**Fix**
- Once you fix the **sample definition (N=787)** and ensure the dependent variable matches, these should move toward the paper values.
- Also ensure you compute standardized betas the same way (see Section 6).

### Model 2 (Demographic): β mismatches (and some sign mismatches)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.264** | **-0.246** | No |
| Income pc | **-0.053** | **-0.054** | No (tiny) |
| Prestige | **-0.016** | **-0.006** | No |
| Female | **-0.090** | **-0.083** | No (small) |
| Age | **0.104** | **0.140** | No (moderate) |
| Black | **0.043** | **0.029** | No |
| Hispanic | **0.030** | **-0.029** | **No (sign mismatch)** |
| Other race | missing | **0.005** | **No (missing)** |
| Cons Prot | **0.090** | **0.059** | No |
| No religion | **-0.019** | **-0.012** | No |
| Southern | **0.063** | **0.097** | No |
| Constant (unstd) | **9.285** | **8.507** | No |

**Fix (priority order)**
1. Fix race/ethnicity coding (this likely drives the **Hispanic sign flip** and the “Other race” problem).
2. Fix sample selection/listwise deletion to reach **N=756**.
3. After that, re-check βs.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.157** | **-0.151** | No (very close) |
| Income pc | **-0.050** | **-0.009** | **No (large)** |
| Prestige | **-0.011** | **-0.022** | No |
| Female | **-0.122** | **-0.095** | No |
| Age | **0.083** | **0.110** | No |
| Black | **0.107** | **0.049** | No |
| Hispanic | **0.028** | **0.031** | No (tiny) |
| Other race | missing | **0.053** | **No (missing)** |
| Cons Prot | **0.037** | **0.066** | No |
| No religion | **0.024** | **0.024** | **Yes (match)** |
| Southern | **0.065** | **0.121** | No |
| Political intolerance | **0.190** | **0.164** | No |
| Constant (unstd) | **7.360** | **6.516** | No |

**Fix**
- Again: repair `otherrace`, race/ethnicity missingness, and N (**503**).
- The very large mismatch for **income per capita** (β -0.050 vs -0.009) strongly suggests your `inc_pc` is not constructed like the paper’s (or has different scaling/winsorization, or includes many imputed/zeroed values).
  - Verify the paper’s exact income construction (e.g., household income / household size, handling of top-codes, whether income categories were converted to midpoints).

---

## 4) Standard errors: interpretation mismatch with the “True results”

- The paper’s Table 1 **does not report standard errors**.
- Your generated output includes **p-values and implies SEs exist**, but doesn’t show SEs.
- This is not a numerical mismatch per se, but it *is* a **reporting mismatch** relative to Table 1.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match the paper’s Table 1 presentation:
  - Report **standardized β** and stars only (no SE/p).
- If the goal is to replicate underlying regression tests:
  - Keep SE/p internally, but do not claim you are matching the paper’s SEs (since none are provided).

---

## 5) Significance stars: mismatches

### Model 2: Age and Southern
- Generated:
  - Age: `0.104*` (p≈0.018)
  - Southern: not significant (p≈0.15)
- True:
  - Age: `0.140***`
  - Southern: `0.097**`

**Fix**
- This will not be fixed by star thresholds; it indicates substantive differences in coefficients/SEs from sample/coding. Most likely the same root causes: **wrong N due to missingness, race coding, income coding, or dependent variable coding**.

### Model 3: Political intolerance
- Generated: `0.190**` (p=0.00265)
- True: `0.164***`
- **Mismatch in star level.**

**Fix**
- Once N is corrected to 503 and the variable construction matches, the standard error will likely shrink and may produce *** as in the paper.

## 6) How to make the generated analysis match the paper (actionable checklist)

1. **Lock the sample to GSS 1993 and the paper’s exclusions**
   - Confirm year filter, age restrictions (if any), and valid-response filters exactly match the paper.

2. **Reconstruct the dependent variable exactly**
   - “Number of music genres disliked” must be created from the same genre items and the same rules for “disliked,” handling of “don’t know,” “not asked,” etc.
   - Any deviation changes N and coefficients.

3. **Fix race/ethnicity dummies**
   - Your diagnostics show `otherrace` has **no 1s** and race dummies have **massive missingness**.
   - Recode so:
     - All respondents with known race get 0/1 on each dummy
     - Exactly one category is the reference (all dummies 0)
     - `otherrace` actually captures a non-empty group

4. **Fix income per capita (`inc_pc`)**
   - Match the paper’s approach to:
     - converting categorical income to numeric (if applicable)
     - dividing by household size
     - handling top-codes/outliers
     - missing values
   - The Model 3 β discrepancy suggests this is currently off.

5. **Use the same estimation + standardization method for β**
   - Standardized β should be computed consistently (commonly: standardize all predictors and outcome, then OLS; or compute β = b * SD(X)/SD(Y)).
   - Do not standardize dummy variables in a nonstandard way if the paper used a different convention—check the authors’ method (often they still report standardized betas for dummies, but it must be computed consistently).

6. **Apply listwise deletion per model**
   - Model 1 should not be reduced by missingness in Model 2/3-only variables.
   - Model 2 should not require `pol_intol`.
   - Model 3 will have lowest N, but should be **503**, not 286.

If you paste the code you used to (a) build `num_genres_disliked`, (b) build race dummies, (c) build `inc_pc`, and (d) filter the analytic samples for each model, I can pinpoint the exact lines causing the N loss, the `otherrace` zero-variance bug, and the Hispanic sign flip.
