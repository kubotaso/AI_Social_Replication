============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches (and table formatting problems)

**Mismatch A: “table1_style” omits variable names for most rows.**  
- In the generated table, only the DV header is labeled; the coefficient rows are unlabeled (just numbers and dashes).  
- In the true table, every row is explicitly labeled (Education, Household income per capita, etc.).

**Fix:** ensure your table-printing function includes the `term` labels (e.g., don’t drop the first column when rendering; if using `modelsummary`/`stargazer`/`gt`, explicitly pass `coef_map` or keep rownames).

---

**Mismatch B: Model names don’t match the “true” paper’s labels.**  
- Generated: “Model 1 (SES)”, “Model 2 (Demographic)”, “Model 3 (Political intolerance)” (lowercase “intolerance”).  
- True: “SES Model”, “Demographic Model”, “Political Intolerance Model”.

**Fix:** rename models in the output; minor, but if you’re trying to “match” the paper, use the paper’s exact labels/capitalization.

---

**Mismatch C: Term names differ from the paper’s display names (minor but required for exact match).**  
- Generated uses dataset-style variable names: `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, etc.  
- True table uses human-readable labels (Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, etc.).

**Fix:** map variable names to printed labels, e.g.  
- `educ` → Education  
- `income_pc` → Household income per capita  
- `prestg80` → Occupational prestige  
- `conservative_protestant` → Conservative Protestant  
- `no_religion` → No religion  
- `southern` → Southern  
- `political_intolerance` → Political intolerance

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **every coefficient mismatch** between generated and true tables.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.310*** | -0.322*** | off by +0.012 |
| Household income per capita | -0.038 | -0.037 | slightly off |
| Occupational prestige | 0.025 | 0.016 | off by +0.009 |

**Fix:** You are not reproducing the same estimation sample and/or standardization as the paper. See Section 5 (sample sizes) and Section 6 (standardization).

---

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.289*** | -0.246*** | **large** mismatch (-0.043) |
| Household income per capita | -0.049 | -0.054 | small mismatch |
| Occupational prestige | -0.003 | -0.006 | small mismatch |
| Female | -0.080 (p=.058, no star) | -0.083* | star + coefficient mismatch |
| Age | 0.097* | 0.140*** | **large** mismatch; significance wrong |
| Black | 0.098 | 0.029 | **large** mismatch and even directionally much bigger |
| Hispanic | -0.075 | -0.029 | big mismatch |
| Other race | -0.016 | 0.005 | sign mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.091* | 0.059 | mismatch + significance differs (paper: not sig) |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.012 | matches (essentially exact) |
| Southern | 0.067 | 0.097** | mismatch + significance differs |

**Fix:** This pattern (many betas off, and especially race/age/south) strongly suggests your constructed variables and/or coding differ from the paper’s (e.g., reference categories; how “other race” is defined; whether age is centered/scaled; whether weights are used; whether missing values were handled consistently). Also your **N is drastically different** (see Section 5).

---

#### Model 3 (Political Intolerance)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.162* | -0.151** | mismatch + significance differs |
| Household income per capita | -0.051 | -0.009 | **large** mismatch |
| Occupational prestige | -0.012 | -0.022 | mismatch |
| Female | -0.121* | -0.095* | mismatch |
| Age | 0.077 | 0.110* | mismatch + significance differs |
| Black | 0.062 | 0.049 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.030 | 0.031 | matches |
| Other race | 0.052 | 0.053 | matches |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.039 | 0.066 | mismatch |
| No religion | 0.025 | 0.024 | matches |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.121** | **large** mismatch + significance differs |
| Political intolerance | 0.181** | 0.164*** | mismatch + significance differs |

**Fix:** Again consistent with different sample, different coding, and likely different scaling of the political intolerance index.

---

### 3) Standard error mismatches (conceptual: SEs should not be there)

**Mismatch D: Generated output reports standard errors; the true Table 1 does not report SEs.**  
- Generated “table1_style” clearly includes a second line under each coefficient that appears to be SEs (e.g., for educ in Model 1: -0.310 then 0.038).  
- True table explicitly states: **standardized coefficients only; SEs not printed.**

**Fix options (pick one depending on your goal):**
1. **To match the printed table:** remove SEs from the table entirely.  
2. **If you want to keep SEs for your own work:** do not claim they come from Table 1; label them as “SEs from replication model” and acknowledge the paper didn’t print them.

---

### 4) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj. R², constants)

#### R² / Adjusted R²
- Model 1: Generated R²=0.097 vs True R²=0.107 (Adj: 0.094 vs 0.104)
- Model 2: Generated R²=0.152 matches True R²=0.151 closely, but Adj R²=0.133 vs 0.139 (off)
- Model 3: Generated R²=0.145 vs True R²=0.169 (Adj: 0.107 vs 0.148) **big mismatch**

**Fix:** These are not “rounding” differences—especially Model 3. This again indicates you’re not using the same:
- estimation sample,
- variable construction,
- and/or weights.

#### Constants
- Model 1: 10.848 vs 10.920 (off)
- Model 2: 9.860 vs 8.507 (**big mismatch**)
- Model 3: 7.784 vs 6.516 (**big mismatch**)

**Fix:** constants will move a lot if:
- the sample changes (y-mean changes),
- the DV construction differs,
- or you’re using standardized vs unstandardized models inconsistently (the paper prints standardized betas but still prints an unstandardized constant).

---

### 5) Sample size (N) mismatches — the largest single discrepancy

True Ns: **787**, **756**, **503**  
Generated Ns: **748**, **505**, **284**

These are not close. Your Models 2 and 3 drop **hundreds** more cases than the paper.

Your own missingness diagnostics show why:
- `hispanic` has **298 missing** (only 595 nonmissing out of 893 music-complete)  
- `political_intolerance` has **402 missing** (only 491 nonmissing out of 893)

That implies you coded Hispanic and political intolerance with massive missingness—far more than the paper’s effective N suggests.

**Fix:** You need to reconstruct these variables the way the paper did:
- **Hispanic:** in many surveys, Hispanic is not “missing for non-Hispanics”; it’s often a separate ethnicity indicator. If you currently have “missing unless respondent is Hispanic,” you must recode missing to 0 for non-Hispanics where appropriate, or derive Hispanic from a full race/ethnicity scheme used in the paper.
- **Political intolerance:** the paper’s N=503 suggests far fewer missing than your N=284. Likely they:
  - built the index from multiple items with rules like “require at least k answered items,” then scale/average, rather than requiring complete data on every item;
  - or used a different year/subsample or a different set of items than you used;
  - or treated “don’t know”/“not asked” differently.

Practically: implement the same inclusion rule as the paper (e.g., “compute index if respondent answered at least X of Y items; otherwise missing”), and verify you’re using the same survey wave and skip-pattern.

---

### 6) Standardization mismatch (what “standardized OLS coefficients” means in the paper)

The true results are **standardized coefficients**. Your `coefficients_long` calls them `beta_std`, but the values don’t match well, implying your standardization procedure differs.

Common replication error sources:
- Standardizing using the **analysis sample** vs using a different reference sample.
- Using population weights vs unweighted standard deviations.
- Standardizing the **DV and all IVs** (y- and x-standardization) vs reporting “beta weights” computed in some other way.
- Handling of binary predictors (some authors still standardize them; others report unstandardized for dummies even in “standardized” tables—papers vary).

**Fix:** match the paper’s method exactly:
- Confirm whether they standardized **all predictors** (including dummies) and whether they standardized the DV.
- Use the **same sample** for computing SDs as used in the model (usually listwise within each model).
- If weights were used in the paper, compute weighted SDs and weighted regression.

---

### 7) Significance / interpretation mismatches

Because coefficients, SEs, and Ns differ, your stars differ in several places (female, age, southern, political intolerance, etc.). That’s not just a cosmetic mismatch; it changes substantive interpretation.

Examples:
- **Age (Model 2):** Generated 0.097* vs True 0.140*** → your write-up would understate age’s association and overstate uncertainty.
- **Southern (Model 2 & 3):** Generated nonsignificant vs True **positive and significant** → would change claims about regional differences.
- **Political intolerance:** Generated ** (p≈.0047) vs True *** → you would understate strength of evidence.

**Fix:** once you correct sample construction, variable coding, and standardization/weights, recompute p-values; do not “force” stars to match.

---

## What you should change to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Rebuild the analytic samples to match N=787/756/503**  
   - Fix `hispanic` coding (avoid treating “not Hispanic” as missing).  
   - Fix political intolerance index construction and missing-data rule.

2. **Verify you are using the same wave/subset as the paper**  
   - Your diagnostics mention “year_1993”; confirm the paper’s table is actually for that same year and same filtering rules.

3. **Match weighting and standardization**  
   - If the paper used weights, apply them in OLS and in computing standardized betas.  
   - Standardize in the same way the authors did (including or excluding dummies; within-model sample).

4. **Match the printed output format**  
   - Remove SEs from the displayed table (since Table 1 doesn’t report them).  
   - Use the paper’s variable labels and model labels.

If you share the code used to create `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` (especially how missing is defined and how the index is scored), I can point to the exact recoding steps that would most likely recover the paper’s Ns and bring coefficients into line.
