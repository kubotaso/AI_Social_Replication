============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics: **R², adj. R², and N are wrong in every model**

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N mismatch:** Generated **747** vs True **787** (off by **-40**).
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.088** vs True **0.107** (too low).
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.085** vs True **0.104** (too low).

**How to fix**
- Your generated models are being fit on a *smaller analytic sample* than the paper/table. To match Table 1 you must reproduce the paper’s **listwise-deletion rule for that model** and the same **GSS 1993 subset/filters**.
- Concretely: ensure you are using the **same year (1993), same respondents**, and the **same inclusion criteria** as the paper (e.g., valid values on DV and model covariates only; no extra restrictions like requiring nonmissing political intolerance in Models 1–2).
- Check you did **not** accidentally restrict to people who answered the music module or intolerance items when estimating Models 1–2.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N mismatch:** Generated **507** vs True **756** (off by **-249**).
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.139** vs True **0.151**.
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.120** vs True **0.139** (far too low).

**How to fix**
- This looks like you’re (incorrectly) applying missingness from variables *not in the model* (especially `hispanic` and possibly `pol_intol`) or using a different missing-data handling rule.
- To match Table 1, Model 2 must be fit on cases nonmissing on: DV + education + inc + prestige + female + age + race dummies + religion dummies + south **only**.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N mismatch:** Generated **334** vs True **503** (off by **-169**).
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.142** vs True **0.169**.
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.110** vs True **0.148** (too low).

**How to fix**
- Same issue: your analytic sample is much smaller than the table’s. Ensure the political intolerance measure is coded exactly as the paper did (range, missing codes, and any scale construction), and apply listwise deletion only on DV + Model 3 covariates.

## 2) Constants (intercepts): **all three are mismatched**

Table 1 reports **unstandardized constants**, while slopes are **standardized (β)**. Your constants are close-ish but still off:

- **Model 1 Constant:** Generated **10.638** vs True **10.920** (too low)
- **Model 2 Constant:** Generated **8.675** vs True **8.507** (too high)
- **Model 3 Constant:** Generated **6.464** vs True **6.516** (too low)

**How to fix**
- Once the **sample** and **coding** match, constants typically fall into place.
- Also confirm you’re not centering/scaling the DV inadvertently. (If you standardized Y, the intercept would be ~0; yours aren’t, so you likely didn’t standardize Y—but sample/coding differences still affect the intercept.)

## 3) Coefficients (β): variable-by-variable mismatches

Below I compare the generated **standardized betas** to the true Table 1 betas.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.0386 | -0.037 | close (minor) |
| Prestige | 0.0200 | 0.016 | small difference |

**Fix**
- Main problem is again sample/coding; education’s beta is notably off.
- Verify education is the same measure (years) and that you used the same valid range handling.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | too large in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.0507 | -0.054 | close |
| Prestige | -0.0106 | -0.006 | small difference |
| Female | -0.0854* | -0.083* | close |
| **Age** | **0.1029***? (generated shows `*`) | **0.140*** | **too small; sig level wrong** |
| **Black** | **0.100** | **0.029** | **direction same but far too large** |
| **Hispanic** | **0.074** | **-0.029** | **sign wrong** |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **0.005** | **sign wrong** |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.087 | 0.059 | too large |
| No religion | -0.0148 | -0.012 | close |
| **Southern** | **0.061** | **0.097** | too small; sig differs (** in true) |

**Fix**
- The race coefficients being wrong in sign/magnitude strongly suggests **dummy coding / reference category problems** or different race variable construction.
  - Confirm the **reference category** in the paper (typically White) and that you created *mutually exclusive* dummies: Black, Hispanic, Other race, with White omitted.
  - Make sure `hispanic` isn’t coded as a standalone ethnicity flag that overlaps with “black/white” unless the paper defines it that way. The table implies **Hispanic is a separate category** (i.e., race recode), not an “ethnicity=yes/no” layered on top of race.
- Age effect discrepancy can come from:
  - different age measure (e.g., top-coding, missing handling)
  - different sample composition (your N is drastically smaller, which will change β)

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.144* | -0.151** | slightly smaller; sig level wrong |
| **Income pc** | **-0.0615** | **-0.009** | **much too negative** |
| **Prestige** | **0.0078** | **-0.022** | **sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.122* | -0.095* | too negative |
| **Age** | **0.079 (ns)** | **0.110* ** | too small; sig wrong |
| Black | 0.122 | 0.049 | too large |
| Hispanic | 0.052 | 0.031 | modest diff |
| Other race | 0.035 | 0.053 | modest diff |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.053 | 0.066 | modest diff |
| No religion | 0.027 | 0.024 | close |
| **Southern** | **0.070 (ns)** | **0.121** ** | too small; sig wrong |
| **Political intolerance** | **0.197*** ** | **0.164*** | too large |

**Fix**
- Income and prestige being off (including sign flip for prestige) again points to **coding differences** (income scaling, prestige measure version) and/or **sample restriction** (your Model 3 N is 334 vs 503).
- Political intolerance beta too large could be:
  - different scale construction (you label 0–15; verify the paper’s exact range and whether items were summed, averaged, or standardized before entry)
  - different missing handling in constructing the index (e.g., requiring complete items vs allowing partial)

## 4) Standard errors & p-values: your inference does **not** match Table 1’s reporting

### Discrepancy
- True Table 1: **does not report SEs** and uses **stars based on two-tailed p-values** for the *standardized coefficients* they present.
- Generated output: shows **p-values**, and significance stars attached to those p-values—but because your **coefficients and N are wrong**, your stars inevitably diverge (e.g., Age and Southern in Models 2–3).

**How to fix**
- Once coefficients/sample match, your p-values/stars should align more closely. But also:
  - Make sure you are using **OLS with the same weighting** (if the paper uses weights; many GSS analyses do). Weights change SEs and sometimes betas slightly.
  - Make sure you compute stars with the same thresholds (you listed p<.05/.01/.001, which matches the note).

## 5) Variable-name mismatches / clarity issues

### Generated vs True naming
- Generated uses both `pol_intol` (missingness table) and “Political intolerance (0–15)” (model table). True table calls it “Political intolerance” without the range note.
- DV name in missingness: `num_genres_disliked`, matches the concept.

**Fix**
- Standardize naming so the analysis output uses *one* identifier per construct (e.g., `pol_intol` everywhere) and ensure the coding matches what Table 1 uses.
- Confirm that `hispanic` variable is coded to match the table’s conceptualization (category vs flag).

---

## 6) The single biggest cause: your **missingness/analytic sample logic** is inconsistent with Table 1

Your missingness table shows very high missingness:
- DV missing: **44.4%**
- pol_intol missing: **36.2%**
- hispanic missing: **35.0%**

Given those rates, it’s easy to accidentally:
- apply listwise deletion across *all* variables in the dataset,
- or carry Model 3 restrictions back into Models 1–2,
- or construct race/ethnicity in a way that creates large missingness.

**How to fix (implementation checklist)**
1. **Fit each model on its own analytic sample**:
   - Model 1: drop missings on DV + (educ, inc_pc, prestige) only.
   - Model 2: drop missings on DV + Model 2 covariates only.
   - Model 3: drop missings on DV + Model 3 covariates only.
2. **Recreate the paper’s race coding** (mutually exclusive categories; same reference group).
3. **Recreate the paper’s political intolerance scale** exactly (items, scoring, missing rules).
4. **Apply the same weights (if any)** and same design decisions as the paper.
5. After (1)–(4), re-check that your **N matches** (787/756/503). If N doesn’t match, stop—coefficients won’t match either.

If you share the code you used to (a) recode race/ethnicity and (b) build `pol_intol`, I can pinpoint exactly why Hispanic/Other race flip signs and why N collapses so severely.
