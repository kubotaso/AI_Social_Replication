Score: 32/100
============================================================

Below is a variable-by-variable audit of **every mismatch** between the *Generated Results* and the *True Results (Table 1 in PDF)*, covering **(a) variable names, (b) standardized coefficients, (c) standard errors / reporting, (d) fit statistics and Ns, and (e) interpretation/significance**, plus **exact fixes** needed for the generated analysis to match the printed table.

---

## 1) Reporting format discrepancy: **SEs are shown but should not be**
### Mismatch
- **Generated**: `table1_style` prints one line of coefficients and a second line that appears to be **standard errors** (e.g., under educ it shows `-0.332***` and below it `-0.034`).
- **True**: Table 1 in the PDF reports **standardized coefficients only** and **does not print standard errors**.

### Why this is a problem
Those second-line numbers in the generated table are not “true SEs” from the PDF (since none are printed). Presenting them implies you extracted/replicated SEs from the table, which is impossible from the PDF table alone.

### Fix
- Remove the “standard error” rows entirely from the output table to match the PDF.
- If you want SEs, you must say they come from *your re-estimation on the microdata* (and then the coefficients must match too, see below).

---

## 2) Variable-name mismatches (minor but real)
### Mismatch
The *term* labels differ from Table 1’s printed names:

| True table label | Generated term |
|---|---|
| Education | `educ` (OK conceptually, but not same printed name) |
| Household income per capita | `income_pc` (OK but not printed name) |
| Occupational prestige | `prestg80` (OK but not printed name) |
| Conservative Protestant | `conservative_protestant` (OK but not printed name) |
| Political intolerance | `political_intolerance` (matches) |

### Fix
Relabel terms in the final table to match Table 1 exactly (presentation fix). For example:
- `educ` → **Education**
- `income_pc` → **Household income per capita**
- `prestg80` → **Occupational prestige**
- `conservative_protestant` → **Conservative Protestant**
- `no_religion` → **No religion**
- etc.

This won’t fix coefficient mismatches, but it fixes the “variable name mismatch” requirement.

---

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (this is the core problem)

All coefficients in the PDF are **standardized betas**. Your `coefficients_long` shows `beta_std`, so you are *trying* to match the right quantity—but many values (and stars) don’t match the PDF.

### Model 1 (SES): mismatches
| Variable | Generated beta_std | True beta | Match? | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | **-0.332*** | **-0.322*** | No | Recompute using the same sample + same standardization + same model spec as authors |
| HH income pc | -0.0339 | -0.037 | Slightly off | Same as above |
| Occ prestige | 0.0294 | 0.016 | No | Same as above |
| Constant | 11.086 | 10.920 | No | Same sample/spec; constant depends on unstandardized model/scaling |
| R² | 0.1088 | 0.107 | Close but off | Same as above |
| N | **758** | **787** | No | Use same inclusion rules / missing-data handling / year filter |

### Model 2 (Demographic): mismatches
| Variable | Generated | True | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.302*** | **-0.246*** | No (big) |
| Income pc | -0.0566 | -0.054 | Slight off |
| Prestige | -0.0075 | -0.006 | Close |
| Female | **-0.0776 (p≈.061; no star)** | **-0.083\*** | No (significance differs) |
| Age | **0.1089\*** | **0.140*** | No (size + sig) |
| Black | 0.0529 | 0.029 | No |
| Hispanic | -0.0172 | -0.029 | No |
| Other race | -0.0159 | 0.005 | No (sign differs) |
| Cons Prot | 0.0400 | 0.059 | No |
| No religion | -0.0162 | -0.012 | Slight off |
| Southern | **0.0789 (no star)** | **0.097\*\*** | No (size + sig) |
| Constant | **10.089** | **8.507** | No (big) |
| R² | **0.157** | **0.151** | Off |
| N | **523** | **756** | No (very big) |

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): mismatches
| Variable | Generated | True | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157\* | -0.151\*\* | No (sig differs) |
| Income pc | -0.067 | -0.009 | No (big) |
| Prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | No |
| Female | -0.118\* | -0.095\* | No |
| Age | 0.0918 | 0.110\* | No (sig differs) |
| Black | 0.004 | 0.049 | No |
| Hispanic | 0.091 | 0.031 | No |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | **Yes (only exact match)** |
| Cons Prot | -0.011 | 0.066 | No (sign differs) |
| No religion | 0.018 | 0.024 | Slight off |
| Southern | 0.073 | 0.121\*\* | No (big) |
| Political intolerance | **0.196\*\*** | **0.164\*\*\*** | No (size + star differ) |
| Constant | **7.583** | **6.516** | No |
| R² | **0.152** | **0.169** | No |
| N | **293** | **503** | No (very big) |

## 4) Sample size / missing-data handling is inconsistent with the true table (major)
### Mismatch
Ns differ drastically:

| Model | Generated N | True N |
|---|---:|---:|
| Model 1 | 758 | 787 |
| Model 2 | 523 | 756 |
| Model 3 | 293 | 503 |

The generated diagnostics show huge missingness for `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`, and even a note:
> “hispanic: derived from ethnic==1 (fallback heuristic)”

That is a red flag: you are not using the same variable construction as the authors, and you are likely turning valid cases into missing (or misclassifying), shrinking N.

### Fixes (what to change so your N matches theirs)
1. **Stop using “fallback heuristics”** for Hispanic.  
   Use the dataset’s official coding that the authors used (often: separate race and ethnicity items; Hispanic is ethnicity regardless of race).
   - Your current `hispanic` is missing for 281 of 893 DV-complete cases, which is implausibly high for a core demographic variable unless you constructed it incorrectly.

2. **Recreate `political_intolerance` exactly as the authors did.**  
   Your diagnostics say:
   - `political_intolerance_items_required = 15`
   - nonmissing only 491 out of 893 DV-complete, leaving 402 missing.
   
   That construction requirement may be stricter than the authors’. If Table 1 has **N=503** for Model 3, you should be losing **390** from 893, not **600**+ from the original 1606. You need the exact scale rule:
   - Which items?
   - What coding direction?
   - What minimum answered items? (15 required may be wrong)
   - Did they allow partial scales (e.g., mean of nonmissing items) rather than complete-case across all 15?

3. **Match the paper’s listwise deletion rule model-by-model.**
   - The true Ns suggest the authors likely did **listwise deletion within each model** (common), but with correctly coded predictors, so N stays high (756 in Model 2).
   - Your Model 2 N collapsing to 523 is almost entirely driven by your `hispanic` missingness.

4. **Confirm the same year/subsample restrictions.**
   Your diagnostics mention `N_year_1993 = 1606`. Ensure the PDF’s Table 1 is also restricted to the same year and same “music module” respondents. If Table 1 uses a different year subset or weighting, that will shift N and coefficients.

## 5) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation error)
Even when coefficients are “close,” the **stars often don’t match**, which is a direct mismatch in inference:

Examples:
- Model 2 `female`: Generated p≈0.061 (no star) vs True `-0.083*`.
- Model 2 `age`: Generated `0.109*` vs True `0.140***`.
- Model 2 `southern`: Generated no star vs True `0.097**`.
- Model 3 `political_intolerance`: Generated `**` vs True `***`.

### Likely causes
- Wrong N (smaller N → bigger SEs → fewer stars), and/or
- Different model specification/variable coding, and/or
- Using different standard errors (robust vs classical), and/or
- Different weighting/complex survey design adjustments.

### Fix
- First fix the **sample construction and variable construction** (Section 4). Stars will often “snap” into place once N matches.
- Then match the authors’ inference method:
  - If they used **survey weights / design-based SEs**, replicate that (e.g., `svy` procedures).
  - If they used **unweighted OLS with conventional SEs**, do that consistently.
  - Match two-tailed thresholds: *p* < .05, .01, .001 (as the table states).

---

## 6) R² / Adjusted R² mismatches
### Mismatch
All models differ somewhat; Model 3 differs notably (0.152 vs 0.169).

### Fix
Once (a) N matches, (b) predictors match, (c) weights/design match, R² should match closely. If it still doesn’t:
- Check whether the paper reports **weighted R²** (some software does this differently).
- Check whether the DV or some IVs were transformed (e.g., log income, top-coding).

---

## 7) Constant term mismatch (and why it’s tricky)
### Mismatch
Constants are off, especially Model 2 (10.089 vs 8.507).

### Interpretation issue
The table is described as “standardized OLS coefficients,” but it also prints a constant. Constants in standardized-beta tables can be confusing: authors may have:
- standardized only predictors (not DV), or
- reported standardized betas but constant from the unstandardized model, or
- used a specific centering approach.

### Fix
To match the constant:
- Determine the authors’ standardization procedure:
  1) Standardize **all variables including DV** before OLS → intercept should be ~0 (not what table shows).  
  2) Compute standardized betas from an **unstandardized** model: \(\beta^* = \beta \cdot \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y}\) while keeping the original intercept → intercept is meaningful (this is most consistent with a nonzero constant).
- Your output suggests you computed `beta_std` separately, but you’re also printing the intercept from your fitted model on the original DV. That’s fine—but it must be on the same sample and with same coding.

---

## 8) What you must change to make the generated analysis match the true table (action checklist)

1. **Use the exact same variables and codings as the authors**
   - Hispanic: derive from the proper ethnicity variable, not a fallback heuristic.
   - Race dummies: ensure mutually exclusive categories match theirs.
   - Income per capita: confirm exact computation (household income / household size?) and any trimming.
   - Prestige: confirm it’s the same prestige scale and treatment of missing.

2. **Rebuild political intolerance to match the paper**
   - Same items, same scoring, same minimum answered items.
   - Avoid requiring all 15 if the authors didn’t.

3. **Replicate the authors’ sample selection**
   - Same wave/year, same respondents eligible for the “music genres disliked” battery.
   - Same handling of “don’t know/refused” on DV items (your DV has 893 complete—confirm this is correct base).

4. **Match estimation method**
   - Weighted vs unweighted OLS?
   - Survey design corrections?
   - Robust vs conventional SEs?
   These affect stars and p-values.

5. **Match table output**
   - Print **standardized betas only** (no SE lines).
   - Use Table 1 variable labels.
   - Use the same star thresholds (already stated).

If you tell me **(a)** what dataset/software you used and **(b)** how you constructed `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` (items + rule), I can point to the *specific* construction choices that are causing the massive N drop (523/293 vs 756/503) and the coefficient drift, and suggest the most likely author-consistent recode.
