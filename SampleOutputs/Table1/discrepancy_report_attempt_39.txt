============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (R², adj. R², N)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N mismatch:** Generated **747** vs True **787**
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.088** vs True **0.107**
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.085** vs True **0.104**

**Likely fixes**
- You are using a different analysis sample than the paper (listwise deletion on different variables, or different filtering/weighting).
- Ensure Model 1 is estimated on the same GSS 1993 subsample and same missing-data rule as the paper:
  - Use **only** the Model 1 variables for listwise deletion (DV + educ + inc_pc + prestige). Don’t pre-drop cases based on variables that only appear in later models (e.g., pol_intol, religion, etc.).
  - Confirm the DV is exactly the same construction as the paper’s “Number of Music Genres Disliked” and coded identically.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N mismatch:** Generated **745** vs True **756**
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.126** vs True **0.151**
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.113** vs True **0.139**

**Fix**
- Same issue: sample differences. Recreate Model 2 using listwise deletion on DV + all Model 2 predictors **only**, and confirm identical recodes of race, religion, region.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N close but off:** Generated **501** vs True **503**
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.155** vs True **0.169**
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.134** vs True **0.148**

**Fix**
- Align coding of **pol_intol** and ensure the same cases are retained (e.g., handling of “don’t know/refused/not asked” and any top/bottom-coding).

---

## 2) Variable name mismatches (labels vs true variables)

These are mostly **presentation mismatches** rather than statistical ones, but they can hide real coding problems.

- Generated labels: **“Education (years)”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, “Southern”, “Female”, “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race”, “Conservative Protestant”, “No religion”, “Political intolerance”**
- True table uses conceptual names, but your missingness block shows the underlying variable names:
  - DV: `num_genres_disliked`
  - Education: `educ_yrs`
  - Income: `inc_pc`
  - Prestige: `prestg80_v`
  - Age: `age_v`
  - Female: `female`
  - Race dummies: `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`
  - Religion dummies: `cons_prot`, `norelig`
  - Region dummy: `south`
  - Political intolerance: `pol_intol`

**Fix**
- Make sure the **same dummy reference categories** match the paper:
  - Race: reference should be **White** (so include dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other).
  - Religion: reference should be “other/mainline/etc.” (whatever the paper used). If your reference differs, coefficients will differ.

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches — Model by model

Important: the **true Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)**; constants are **unstandardized**. Your `*_table1style` outputs appear to be β, so comparisons should be against the **true β**, not your unstandardized `b`.

### Model 1 β mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | close (minor) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | slightly larger |
| Constant (unstd) | **10.638** | **10.920** | too low |

**Fix**
- Sample alignment is the main suspect (N differs by 40).
- Also verify you are standardizing in the same way (see §5 below).

### Model 2 β mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.229*** | -0.246*** | too small |
| Income pc | -0.055 | -0.054 | matches |
| Prestige | **0.005** | **-0.006** | sign differs |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close |
| Age | **0.126*** | **0.140*** | too small |
| Black | 0.017 | 0.029 | smaller |
| Hispanic | **0.055** | **-0.029** | sign differs (major) |
| Other race | **0.022** | **0.005** | larger |
| Cons. Prot. | **0.101** ** | **0.059** | much larger |
| No religion | **0.000** | **-0.012** | differs |
| Southern | **0.070** | **0.097** ** | smaller and loses ** significance in your p column (0.053) |

**Fixes (most likely causes)**
1. **Different dummy coding / reference groups**
   - Hispanic sign flip is a classic indicator that either:
     - your “Hispanic” dummy is not what the paper used (e.g., includes different categories), or
     - race categories overlap (e.g., someone coded as both Black and Hispanic), or
     - the reference group isn’t White/non-Hispanic.
   - Fix by enforcing mutually exclusive race categories and matching the paper’s definition.
2. **Religion coding mismatch**
   - Your Conservative Protestant β is far larger than the true table. That often comes from:
     - different classification of “Conservative Protestant”
     - different reference category (e.g., using “Catholic” vs “all others”)
3. **Sample mismatch**
   - N differs (745 vs 756), affecting everything including significance for Southern.

### Model 3 β mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.121* | -0.151** | too small; significance level differs |
| Income pc | **-0.030** | **-0.009** | much more negative |
| Prestige | **0.011** | **-0.022** | sign differs (major) |
| Female | -0.100* | -0.095* | close |
| Age | **0.085 (ns)** | **0.110*** | smaller + loses significance |
| Black | 0.050 | 0.049 | matches |
| Hispanic | 0.081 | 0.031 | larger |
| Other race | **0.116** ** | **0.053** | much larger |
| Cons. Prot. | **0.099*** | **0.066** | larger |
| No religion | 0.029 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | **0.071 (ns)** | **0.121** ** | much smaller + loses significance |
| Political intolerance | 0.200*** | 0.164*** | too large |
| Constant (unstd) | **5.750** | **6.516** | too low |

**Fixes**
- Again: (a) sample mismatch, (b) different coding for prestige, income, region, and especially (c) standardization method.
- The prestige sign flip in both Models 2 and 3 strongly suggests you are not using the same prestige variable coding (or are using a reversed/recoded version), *or* the table uses a different prestige measure than `prestg80_v`.

## 4) Standard errors mismatches

- **True results:** SEs are **not reported** in the paper’s Table 1 (“—”).
- **Generated results:** you report **p-values and stars**, but **no SE column** either.

So technically:
- There is **no direct SE mismatch to check** because the “true” table does not provide them.
- The discrepancy is interpretive: your output implies inferential stats are computed from your model, but the replication target is a **published table that only shows β and stars**.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match the paper’s Table 1, output only:
  - standardized β
  - significance stars using the paper’s thresholds
  - unstandardized constant
  - R², adj. R², N  
  Do not claim SE mismatches can be evaluated against Table 1.

---

## 5) Interpretation/formatting mismatches (what your table is claiming)

### A) You mix unstandardized and standardized coefficients across displays
- In `model*_full`, you provide both **b** and **beta**, but your `model*_table1style` reports **beta** for predictors and **unstandardized constant**.
- That matches the *idea* of the true table, but to replicate exactly you must ensure the β calculation matches the paper.

**Fix**
- Compute standardized coefficients the same way as the authors/software:
  - Most commonly: standardize **X and Y** (z-scores) then run OLS → coefficients are β.
  - Or use software’s `lm.beta`-style conversion. These can differ slightly with missingness and weighting.
- Also confirm whether the original table used **weights**; weighted standardization can change β and significance.

### B) Significance star mismatches
Examples:
- Model 3 Education: generated `*` but true is `**`
- Model 3 Age: generated not significant, true has `*`
- Model 2 Southern: generated ~`p=.053` (ns), true is `**`

**Fix**
- Once sample + coding + weighting align, p-values should move toward the paper’s star pattern.
- Also ensure you’re using the same **two-tailed** tests and same df assumptions.

## 6) Missingness block vs model Ns (internal inconsistency)

Your missingness shows:
- `num_genres_disliked` nonmissing **893**
- `educ_yrs` nonmissing **1464**, `inc_pc` **1459**, `prestg80_v` **1526**

Yet Model 1 N is **747**, far below 893, suggesting **additional exclusions** beyond the three SES predictors (or a different dataset year/subsample than implied).

**Fix**
- Explicitly compute Model 1 analysis N as intersection:
  - nonmissing(DV, educ_yrs, inc_pc, prestg80_v)
- Then verify that N equals the paper’s 787. If it doesn’t:
  - you’re not on the same year (or not restricting to 1993 properly),
  - or you’re using different variable versions,
  - or you applied extra filters (e.g., age restrictions, valid ranges) not in the paper.

## 7) Concrete steps to make generated match true

1. **Rebuild the exact analysis dataset**
   - Restrict to **GSS 1993** and the same respondents as the paper (check any stated filters).
2. **Recreate the DV exactly**
   - Ensure `num_genres_disliked` matches the paper’s construction (which genres included; how “don’t know/not asked” handled).
3. **Match recodes and reference categories**
   - Race: mutually exclusive Black/Hispanic/Other with White as reference.
   - Religion: match “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” definitions and reference group.
   - South: confirm coding (South vs non-South).
4. **Use model-specific listwise deletion**
   - Model 1 should not be reduced by missingness in Model 2/3-only variables.
5. **Match weighting (if used)**
   - If the paper uses weights, apply the same weight variable and use a method consistent with their software.
6. **Standardize correctly**
   - Generate β the same way as the paper (standardize variables then OLS, or replicate their package procedure).
7. **Then regenerate Table 1-style output**
   - Predictors: standardized β with stars
   - Constant: unstandardized
   - R², adj. R², N

If you share the code you used to (a) recode race/religion and (b) compute standardized betas, I can pinpoint which specific coding choice is producing the Hispanic and prestige sign flips.
