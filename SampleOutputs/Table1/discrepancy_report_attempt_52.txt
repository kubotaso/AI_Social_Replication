## 1) Fit statistics and sample sizes (major mismatches)

### Model N
- **Model 1:** Generated **n=757** vs True **n=787** (−30)
- **Model 2:** Generated **n=522** vs True **n=756** (−234)
- **Model 3:** Generated **n=293** vs True **n=503** (−210)

**How to fix**
- Your “generated” pipeline is almost certainly doing **listwise deletion on variables that are not in the paper’s model**, or using different missing-value handling than the paper.
- The missingness table shows **pol_intol missing ~47%**, but the paper’s Model 3 still has **503** cases (not 293). That means either:
  - the paper used a **different intolerance variable** (with less missingness), and/or
  - the paper used **pairwise deletion / imputation / different coding** rather than complete-case deletion, and/or
  - you merged/subsetted the data differently (e.g., dropped “Don’t know/NA” differently).

Concretely:
1. **Recreate the exact GSS 1993 sample restrictions** used in the paper (year, age limits if any, valid-response filters).
2. Ensure you code missing exactly as the authors did (GSS often uses special codes like 8/9/98/99).
3. For each model, build the analysis frame using **only variables in that model** (no accidental inclusion of others).
4. Verify the “political intolerance” construction matches the paper (items, scaling 0–15, and missing rules).

### R² and Adjusted R²
- **Model 1:** Gen **R²=0.0998 / adj=0.0963** vs True **0.107 / 0.104**
- **Model 2:** Gen **0.1464 / 0.1297** vs True **0.151 / 0.139**
- **Model 3:** Gen **0.1498 / 0.1166** vs True **0.169 / 0.148**

**How to fix**
- These differences are consistent with **wrong sample (N mismatch)** and **at least one variable mismatch** (see “Other race” below). Fixing the sample and variable coding should move R²/adj R² toward the published values.

---

## 2) Variable name/coding problems

### “Other race” is dropped / NaN in generated models
- Generated models show **“Other race” = NaN** and `dropped = otherrace` in Model 2 and 3.
- True table reports nonzero β for Other race:
  - Model 2: **0.005**
  - Model 3: **0.053**

**What this implies**
- In your estimation sample, `otherrace` is likely **constant** (all 0 or all 1), perfectly collinear, or coded incorrectly (e.g., all respondents classified as White/Black/Hispanic, leaving Other race empty after subsetting).

**How to fix**
- Reconstruct mutually exclusive race dummies exactly:
  - White as reference, and indicators for **Black, Hispanic, Other race** (with “Other” including Asian, Native American, etc., depending on the paper).
- Confirm `otherrace` has variation **within the model’s estimation sample** (frequency table after filtering!).
- Ensure you didn’t inadvertently code Hispanic as race in a way that removes “Other race” category.

## 3) Coefficients (standardized β) mismatches in Table-1-style output

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except constants). Your `model*_table1style` appears to output standardized betas, so compare those directly.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.316*** | **-0.322*** | close (still off) |
| Income pc | **-0.035** | **-0.037** | close (off) |
| Prestige | **0.025** | **0.016** | noticeably off |
| Constant | **10.903** | **10.920** | small diff |
| R² | **0.0998** | **0.107** | off |
| N | **757** | **787** | off |

**Fix**
- Model 1 is “closest,” but still not matching: suggests you’re near correct spec but have **different sample construction/coding** (income scaling, prestige variable version, or missing-value recodes).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
Big discrepancies:
| Term | Generated β | True β |
|---|---:|---:|
| Education | **-0.278*** | **-0.246*** |
| Income pc | **-0.059** | **-0.054** |
| Prestige | **-0.013** | **-0.006** |
| Female | **-0.084*** | **-0.083*** (close) |
| Age | **0.108*** | **0.140*** (large diff) |
| Black | **0.048** | **0.029** |
| Hispanic | **0.026** | **-0.029** (sign flip) |
| Other race | **missing** | **0.005** |
| Cons Prot | **0.078** | **0.059** |
| No religion | **-0.015** | **-0.012** (close) |
| Southern | **0.067** | **0.097** (notable diff) |
| Constant | **9.476** | **8.507** (large diff) |
| N | **522** | **756** (huge) |

**Fix**
- The **N collapse** plus **Hispanic sign flip** strongly indicates **race/ethnicity coding is not aligned** with the paper, and/or you’re using a very different subset due to missingness handling.
- Recheck:
  1. How “Hispanic” is defined (ethnicity vs race; treatment of “Hispanic race” respondents).
  2. Reference category (should be White, non-Hispanic, non-Black, non-Other, typically).
  3. Age variable (paper may use different transformation or age range restriction).
  4. Region: “Southern” coding (Census South vs something else).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.160*** | **-0.151** | close |
| Income pc | **-0.059** | **-0.009** | huge |
| Prestige | **-0.005** | **-0.022** | off |
| Female | **-0.110*** | **-0.095*** | somewhat off |
| Age | **0.086** | **0.110*** | sig + size mismatch |
| Black | **0.110** | **0.049** | large diff |
| Hispanic | **0.020** | **0.031** | small |
| Other race | **missing** | **0.053** | missing |
| Cons Prot | **0.022** | **0.066** | large diff |
| No religion | **0.026** | **0.024** | close |
| Southern | **0.061** | **0.121** | large diff |
| Political intolerance | **0.197** | **0.164** | off |
| Constant | **7.323** | **6.516** | large diff |
| R² | **0.1498** | **0.169** | off |
| N | **293** | **503** | huge |

**Fix**
- Again: wrong **N** + missing `otherrace` + big shifts in several betas → you are not estimating on the same sample and likely not using the same intolerance measure or missing rules.
- The income β discrepancy (−0.059 vs −0.009) is especially suggestive of either:
  - income variable **scaled/trimmed differently** than the paper, or
  - a **different sample composition** (which you clearly have).

## 4) Standard errors: mismatch in what you report vs what “true results” contain

- Generated output includes **unstandardized b**, standardized **beta**, and **p-values**.
- The paper’s Table 1 (true results) reports **standardized β only** (plus stars) and **does not report SEs**.

**Mismatch**
- If your goal is to match the paper’s Table 1, you shouldn’t be comparing your **unstandardized b** or your **SEs** to the table, because they’re not in the paper.

**How to fix**
- For “Table 1 style” replication, output exactly:
  - standardized coefficients (β) for predictors,
  - unstandardized constant,
  - R², adjusted R², N,
  - stars using the same thresholds.
- Treat SE/p-values as internal checks, not “table-matching” targets.

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Because your coefficients/p-values come from a different sample, the **significance pattern** diverges from the published one:

### Clear example: Model 3 Age
- Generated: Age β=0.086, **p=0.138** (not significant)
- True: Age β=0.110* (significant)

### Model 2 Southern
- Generated: β=0.067, p=0.114 (ns)
- True: β=0.097** (significant)

**How to fix**
- Significance differences will largely resolve only after:
  1) matching N and coding, and
  2) matching the exact intolerance scale and demographic codings.

---

## 6) Checklist to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Use the same dependent variable coding**: `num_genres_disliked` must match the paper’s construction (which genres counted, handling of “don’t know,” etc.).
2. **Recreate Table 1’s βs**:
   - Fit OLS on raw variables,
   - then compute standardized coefficients (or standardize predictors/outcome first—be consistent with how β is defined).
3. **Fix race/ethnicity dummies** so “Other race” is estimable and Hispanic matches the paper (including sign).
4. **Fix the political intolerance scale**:
   - confirm items, range (0–15), and missing rule (sum/mean with allowable missing?).
5. **Match the estimation sample per model** (target Ns: 787, 756, 503):
   - After applying the paper’s filters, check complete cases for each model *only on its variables*.
6. **Verify constants**: large constant mismatches in Models 2–3 are another red flag for different sample/coding (especially age/income scaling).

If you share your codebook (exact variable mappings and recodes) or the syntax used to build `pol_intol`, `otherrace`, and `num_genres_disliked`, I can pinpoint the exact coding step that is driving the N collapse and the Hispanic/Other race inconsistencies.
