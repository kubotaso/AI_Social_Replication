============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics mismatches (n, R², adj. R²)

**Model 1 (SES)**
- **n mismatch:** Generated **793** vs True **787**.  
  **Fix:** Use the same GSS 1993 analytic sample and the paper’s listwise-deletion rule for Model 1. Your model frame shows 793 complete cases for the 4 variables you used; the paper evidently has additional exclusions (e.g., weight filter, valid-range recodes, or different missing-value handling). Recreate the paper’s cleaning steps (especially how “DK/NA/Refused” are coded) before listwise deletion.
- **R² / adj. R²:** Generated **0.107613 / 0.104220** vs True **0.107 / 0.104**.  
  These essentially match (rounding only). No substantive fix needed.

**Model 2 (Demographic)**
- **n mismatch (major):** Generated **37** vs True **756**.  
  **Fix:** This indicates your code is dropping almost everyone—most likely because several variables are being treated as missing for nearly all cases (see “NaN” coefficients for hispanic/otherrace/norelig) or because you inadvertently subset to a tiny group.  
  Concretely:
  - Check that `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `norelig` are coded 0/1 with non-missing values for most respondents.
  - Ensure you are not accidentally filtering to rows where *all* race dummies equal 1, or where any factor level is absent.
  - Verify you are using the correct year (1993) and not a very small subset created by merges or a prior filter.
- **R² / adj. R² mismatch (major):** Generated **0.489 / 0.343** vs True **0.151 / 0.139**.  
  **Fix:** Once you restore the correct sample size and variable coding, these should drop toward the published values. With n=37, R² is not comparable.

**Model 3 (Political intolerance)**
- **n mismatch (major):** Generated **19** vs True **503**.  
  **Fix:** Same root cause as Model 2, compounded by adding `pol_intol`. Your `pol_intol` variable is present for 19 cases in your model frame—meaning your intolerance measure is missing/invalid for almost everyone (or you filtered incorrectly). Reconstruct `pol_intol` exactly as the paper did (items used, scaling, and missing-data rules).
- **R² / adj. R² mismatch (major):** Generated **0.588 / 0.176** vs True **0.169 / 0.148**.  
  **Fix:** Will largely resolve when n and coding are corrected.

### 2) Variable name / inclusion mismatches

**Names mostly align**, but you have structural problems in Model 2 and 3:
- **Race/ethnicity dummies:** True model includes **Black, Hispanic, Other race** (all with coefficients).  
  Generated tables show **black has estimates**, but **hispanic and otherrace are NaN** in Models 2 and 3.  
  **Fix:** Your `hispanic` and `otherrace` variables are likely constant (all 0), all missing, or perfectly collinear with other terms (e.g., if you also included a full set of race categories plus an intercept). Ensure:
  - You create *mutually exclusive* categories from a single race/ethnicity variable.
  - You omit one reference group (e.g., White non-Hispanic) to avoid the dummy-variable trap.
  - Values exist in 1993 for those groups (not inadvertently filtered out).
- **Religion:** True includes **Conservative Protestant** and **No religion**, both estimated.  
  Generated shows `cons_prot` estimated, but **`norelig` is NaN** in Models 2 and 3.  
  **Fix:** Same issue: `norelig` is being dropped due to missingness or collinearity. Make sure it’s coded 0/1 and not derivable as the complement of another included dummy in a way that causes perfect collinearity.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (direction, magnitude, and meaning)

A key issue: **the paper reports standardized coefficients (β)**, while your generated output appears to be **unstandardized OLS coefficients** (even though you label them “beta”).

Evidence:
- Your **constant** is around **10.83** (Model 1), close to the paper’s **10.920** (unstandardized constant).
- Your predictors have magnitudes that look like raw-unit slopes (e.g., income per capita as dollars).

So you are mixing scales: **calling them standardized when they are not**.

#### Model 1
True (β): educ **-0.322**, inc_pc **-0.037**, prestg80 **0.016**, constant **10.920**  
Generated: educ_yrs **-0.3297**, inc_pc **-0.0336**, prestg80 **0.0291**, constant **10.833**

- **Education:** close in magnitude/sign (could be coincidence), but still not guaranteed standardized.  
- **Income:** close-ish but again scale ambiguity.
- **Prestige:** generated **0.029** vs true **0.016** (mismatch).
- **Constant:** **10.833** vs **10.920** (small mismatch; could come from sample difference n=793 vs 787).

**Fix (Model 1):**
1. Reproduce **standardized coefficients** for predictors:
   - Either z-score outcome and predictors (except the intercept interpretation changes), or
   - Use a routine that reports standardized β for predictors while leaving constant unstandardized (as in the paper). In many workflows: compute standardized betas as  
     \[
     \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{\text{SD}(X_j)}{\text{SD}(Y)}
     \]
     while keeping the intercept from the unstandardized regression.
2. Match the **sample size** (787) first; coefficients will shift slightly when the sample is corrected.

#### Model 2
True signs/patterns:
- Education **negative** (-0.246***)
- Income **negative** (-0.054)
- Prestige **slightly negative** (-0.006)
- Female **negative** (-0.083*)
- Age **positive** (0.140***)
- South **positive** (0.097**)

Generated (with n=37) shows multiple **sign reversals**:
- educ_yrs **-0.795** (too large)
- inc_pc **+0.182** (should be negative)
- prestg80 **+0.425** (should be ~0 and negative)
- female **+0.077** (should be negative)
- age **-0.018** (should be positive)
- south **+0.224** (direction matches, size not comparable)

**Fix (Model 2):**
- Primary fix is **restore correct n (~756)** by fixing missingness/collinearity so coefficients aren’t computed on 37 cases.
- Then compute **standardized β** for predictors to match the paper’s scale.
- Confirm you are using the same **coding directions** (e.g., female=1, male=0; south=1 for South; etc.). Sign flips can come from reversed coding, but with n=37 it’s more likely sample/coding error.

#### Model 3
True:
- Education **negative** (-0.151**)
- Income ~0 and negative (-0.009)
- Prestige **negative** (-0.022)
- Female **negative** (-0.095*)
- Age **positive** (0.110*)
- Political intolerance **positive** (0.164***)
- Constant **6.516**
- n **503**

Generated (n=19):
- Education **-0.284** (not significant)
- Income **+0.207** (wrong sign)
- Prestige **+0.511** (wrong sign)
- Female **+0.206** (wrong sign)
- Age **+0.148** (sign matches)
- pol_intol **+0.313** (sign matches, but not comparable)
- Constant **-7.185** (wildly wrong vs +6.516)

**Fix (Model 3):**
- Rebuild `pol_intol` and missing-data handling to get **n≈503**.
- Fix race/religion dummy issues (NaNs) to avoid distorted estimation.
- Compute standardized β for predictors; keep intercept unstandardized.

### 4) Standard errors / p-values mismatch (reporting discrepancy)

- **True table:** explicitly states **SE are not reported**; only significance stars for standardized β, constants unstandardized.
- **Generated output:** reports **p-values and stars**, but **no SE**; also includes NaN p-values for dropped variables.

**Fix:**
- If you want to match the paper: **do not present SE or p-values**, only standardized β and stars using the paper’s thresholds.
- If you must compute stars yourself, compute them from your model’s t-tests—but note they may not match the published stars unless the **same sample, coding, weights, and standardization** are used.

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches (what the coefficients mean)

Because the paper’s coefficients are **standardized**, interpretations should be in SD units:

- **Correct interpretation (paper):** “A 1 SD increase in education is associated with a 0.322 SD decrease in genres disliked (Model 1).”
- **Your generated analysis (implicitly):** would be interpreted as “one additional year of education reduces disliked genres by 0.33,” which is a *different estimand*.

**Fix:** Decide which estimand you are reporting.
- To match the paper: interpret **standardized β** for predictors; do not interpret them as raw-unit changes.
- Keep the intercept interpretation consistent with the paper (unstandardized constant).

## Summary of what to change so generated analysis matches the true results

1. **Recreate the analytic sample exactly (year=1993; same exclusions; listwise deletion per model).** Your n should be **787 / 756 / 503**, not 793 / 37 / 19.
2. **Fix dummy-variable construction** so `hispanic`, `otherrace`, and `norelig` are not all-missing/collinear and thus not dropped.
3. **Report standardized coefficients (β) for predictors** (and unstandardized constants), matching Table 1’s convention.
4. **Match reporting format:** no SE in the table; use significance stars with the stated cutoffs.
5. After (1)–(3), re-check: signs and magnitudes should align closely, and R² should be near **0.107 / 0.151 / 0.169**.

If you paste your variable construction code (especially for `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `norelig`, and `pol_intol`) and your filtering steps, I can pinpoint exactly why you collapse to n=37 and n=19 and give precise recodes to reproduce the paper’s sample sizes.
