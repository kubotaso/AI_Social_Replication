Score: 62/100
============================================================

Below is an item-by-item audit of **every mismatch** between the *Generated Results* and the *True Results* (Table 1 as printed), grouped by (a) variable naming/structure, (b) coefficients & significance, (c) standard errors, (d) fit stats and N, and (e) interpretation/claims implied by the generated output. For each discrepancy I explain **how to fix it so the generated analysis matches the printed table**.

---

## 1) Variable names / labeling mismatches

### 1.1 DV label mismatch (minor, but still a mismatch risk)
- **True** DV wording: *Number of music genres disliked*
- **Generated** DV wording: *DV: Number of music genres disliked* (same meaning)
- **Fix:** No substantive fix needed. Keep wording identical to the table caption if you want perfect alignment.

### 1.2 Predictor naming mismatches (cosmetic but should be aligned)
Generated uses internal variable names:
- `educ` vs **Education**
- `income_pc` vs **Household income per capita**
- `prestg80` vs **Occupational prestige**
- `female` vs **Female**
- `black` vs **Black**
- `hispanic` vs **Hispanic**
- `other_race` vs **Other race**
- `conservative_protestant` vs **Conservative Protestant**
- `no_religion` vs **No religion**
- `southern` vs **Southern**
- `political_intolerance` vs **Political intolerance**

**Fix:** Map/rename in the table output layer (don’t change estimation). For example:
- `educ` → “Education”
- `income_pc` → “Household income per capita”
- etc.

This won’t fix coefficient mismatches, but it fixes “variable name mismatch.”

---

## 2) Coefficient and significance mismatches (core problems)

Important: the **True Results are standardized coefficients only** (no SEs printed). Your generated table appears to show **standardized betas** (top number) and then another line that looks like **standard errors**. Regardless, the standardized coefficients do **not** match Table 1.

I list mismatches by model and variable.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | -0.332*** | coefficient off |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | coefficient off |
| Occ prestige | 0.016 | 0.029 | coefficient off |

Also:
- **Constant** true 10.920 vs generated 11.086 (off)
- **R²** true 0.107 vs generated 0.10877 (off)
- **Adj R²** true 0.104 vs generated 0.105224 (off)
- **N** true 787 vs generated 758 (**major**)

**Fixes (likely required):**
1) **Use the correct estimation sample (N=787).** Your generated “listwise” sample for model 1 is 758. That alone can shift all coefficients, constants, and R².
   - Concretely: replicate the paper’s **missing-data handling**. Table 1 is almost certainly **not** using the same listwise deletion rules you used (or you computed DV differently and lost cases).
2) Ensure you are standardizing **the same way as the authors.** See Section 4 below; different standardization rules also change standardized betas.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

Here N matches (756), but coefficients still differ.

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.260*** | off |
| HH income pc | -0.054 | -0.051 | off |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | 0.007 | **sign flips** |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.090** | coefficient + **sig level differs** |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.129*** | off |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.004 | off |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | 0.034 | **sign flips** |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.001 | off (minor) |
| Cons Protestant | 0.059 | 0.065 | off (minor) |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.005 | off (minor) |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.085* | coefficient + **sig differs** |
| Constant | 8.507 | 8.807 | off |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.145 | off |
| Adj R² | 0.139 | 0.133 | off |

**Fixes (likely required):**
1) **Check coding of race/ethnicity dummies and reference categories.**
   - The sign flip for **Hispanic** and the prestige shift strongly suggest **different dummy coding** than the authors used (or different base group).
   - Example failure mode: you included both `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` as 0/1 but the paper may have coded race differently (e.g., mutually exclusive categories vs multiple responses; or different baseline such as “nonwhite”).
   - Fix: Recreate the exact race variable construction from the paper/codebook:
     - Ensure **mutual exclusivity**
     - Ensure **the same omitted reference** (usually White non-Hispanic)
     - Ensure Hispanics are not also coded as White/Black simultaneously.
2) **Check occupational prestige variable definition.**
   - `prestg80` may not be the prestige measure used in the paper (or the paper used a transformed / recoded version).
   - Fix: Confirm the exact prestige measure in the paper (e.g., NORC prestige score; maybe a different year or scale) and recode accordingly.
3) **Ensure the DV construction matches the paper** (see Section 3).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

N differs (true 503 vs generated 501), and coefficients differ.

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.140* | coefficient + sig differs |
| HH income pc | -0.009 | -0.036 | **large mismatch** |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | 0.002 | **sign flips** |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.117** | coefficient + sig differs |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.088 (p≈.052) | coefficient + sig differs |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.012 | off |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | 0.065 | off |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.062 | off (minor) |
| Cons Protestant | 0.066 | 0.059 | off (minor) |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.027 | close |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.091* | coefficient + sig differs |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.187*** | off |
| Constant | 6.516 | 6.625 | off |
| R² | 0.169 | 0.153 | off |
| Adj R² | 0.148 | 0.132 | off |
| N | 503 | 501 | mismatch |

**Fixes (likely required):**
1) **Fix sample selection to exactly N=503.**
   - You’re dropping 2 extra cases relative to the paper—likely due to different missingness rules on political intolerance or another covariate.
2) **Political intolerance scale mismatch is very likely.**
   - Your `political_intolerance` ranges 0–? (you show values up to at least 7; diagnostics mention targets like 11). The paper’s measure might have a different range or construction (e.g., summed items, average, or different item set).
   - Fix: reconstruct the political intolerance index exactly as in the paper (same items, same coding, same handling of “don’t know,” same scaling).
3) **Income per capita mismatch (-0.009 true vs -0.036 generated) suggests either:**
   - wrong income variable (e.g., individual income vs household income; not per capita; not inflation-adjusted), or
   - different transformation (log income, capped values, etc.), or
   - different standardization procedure (see Section 4).
   - Fix: verify you used *household income per capita* as defined by the authors.

## 3) Likely DV construction mismatch (can drive N and betas)

Generated diagnostics show:
- `N_complete_music_18 = 893`, but Model 1 N is 758 and the paper’s Model 1 N is 787.

That gap strongly suggests your DV “num_genres_disliked” is **not constructed with the same inclusion rules** as the paper.

Common points of divergence:
- Which music genres are included (exact list)
- Whether “don’t know / not familiar” responses are treated as missing vs “not disliked”
- Whether the DV is a **count** over a fixed number of genres (e.g., 18 items) with partial nonresponse allowed vs listwise required
- Whether respondents are filtered (e.g., only asked certain items)

**Fix:**
- Rebuild the DV to match the paper:
  1) Use the **exact same set of genre items**.
  2) Use the **same rule** for handling missing genre responses (e.g., allow up to k missing and prorate vs require complete).
  3) Confirm whether “dislike” corresponds to a specific response category and whether neutrals count as “not disliked.”

If you fix only one thing first, fix DV construction + sample inclusion. That often resolves both **N** and multiple coefficient discrepancies at once.

---

## 4) Standardization procedure mismatch (very plausible)

The True table explicitly prints **standardized coefficients**. Your diagnostics note:
> “Standardized betas estimated by OLS on z-scored y and z-scored X within each model sample.”

That is one legitimate approach, but it may **not** match the paper. Authors often compute standardized betas as:
- Run OLS on raw variables, then compute β\_std = b\_raw * SD(X)/SD(Y) using the *analysis sample SDs*, OR
- Standardize only X’s (not Y), OR
- Standardize using *full-sample* SDs, not model-specific SDs, OR
- Use weighted SDs (if survey weights are used)

**Fix:**
- Identify the paper’s standardization method (often stated in methods/appendix).
- To match Table 1 exactly, you may need to:
  - Compute β\_std from raw OLS using the same SD convention they used
  - Use the same sample SDs (full vs model-specific)
  - Use survey weights if the paper did

Given the size of some discrepancies and sign flips, standardization alone won’t explain everything—but it can explain “nearby” numeric differences and significance changes.

## 5) Standard errors: generated output includes them; true table has none

### Mismatch
- **True:** “Table 1 reports standardized coefficients only and does not print standard errors.”
- **Generated:** prints a second line under each coefficient that appears to be a **standard error**.

This is a direct mismatch in reporting.

**Fix options (choose one):**
1) **Remove SEs from the table output** entirely to mirror the PDF.
2) If you must keep SEs, clearly label them as “(SE)” and note: “SEs not shown in published Table 1; reported here from replication.”

But if the goal is “matches the printed table,” you should **not show SEs**.

---

## 6) Fit statistics and constants mismatches

### 6.1 N mismatches (major)
- Model 1: **True 787** vs **Generated 758** (−29)
- Model 3: **True 503** vs **Generated 501** (−2)

**Fix:** replicate the paper’s case inclusion rules model-by-model (DV missingness, covariate missingness, political intolerance availability). This is non-negotiable if you want identical coefficients.

### 6.2 R² and Adj R² mismatches
- Model 1 R²: 0.107 vs 0.10877
- Model 2 R²: 0.151 vs 0.145
- Model 3 R²: 0.169 vs 0.153
(and similarly for adjusted R²)

**Fix:** once (a) sample, (b) variable coding, and (c) standardization match, R² should match (allowing only rounding differences). If still off, check:
- weighted vs unweighted estimation
- robust vs conventional R² (rare, but possible)
- any additional controls or different functional forms

### 6.3 Constants mismatch
All three constants differ (e.g., 10.920 vs 11.086).

**Fix:** constants will align once:
- DV is constructed identically
- sample is identical
- raw-variable model specification matches
(Standardization approach can also affect intercept if you estimated on z-scored variables; the intercept of fully standardized regression should be ~0, so the fact you report nonzero constants suggests you are mixing raw intercepts with standardized betas in presentation.)

---

## 7) Interpretation/significance mismatches

Even without narrative text, your generated table implies significance with stars. Several star patterns conflict with the paper:

Examples:
- **Model 2 Female:** true `-0.083*` vs generated `-0.090**`
- **Model 2 Southern:** true `0.097**` vs generated `0.085*`
- **Model 3 Education:** true `-0.151**` vs generated `-0.140*`
- **Model 3 Age:** true `0.110*` vs generated ~`0.088` (borderline p≈.052)

**Fix:** significance will only match if:
1) you have the **exact same sample**,
2) you have the **same coding**, and
3) you are using the **same standard error computation** as the authors (conventional OLS vs robust vs clustered; and possibly weights/design effects).

But note: since the published table prints only betas (and stars), the authors’ stars may reflect:
- different SE type (e.g., design-based / survey-corrected)
- weighting
So to match stars, you must match their inferential method, not just coefficients.

---

## 8) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the “True Results”

In priority order:

1) **Reproduce the paper’s samples exactly (N=787, 756, 503).**
   - Align missing-data rules.
   - Align DV construction rules.
   - Align political intolerance availability/coding rules.

2) **Reconstruct variables to match the paper’s definitions.**
   - Especially: race/ethnicity dummies (mutual exclusivity + correct reference), prestige measure, and income per capita construction.

3) **Match the estimation method.**
   - Check whether the paper uses weights or survey adjustments.
   - Match robust/clustered SEs if they were used to assign stars.

4) **Match the standardization method for coefficients.**
   - Determine whether betas are computed via z-scoring variables vs post-hoc conversion from raw b’s, and which SDs (model sample vs full sample; weighted vs unweighted).

5) **Match the reporting format.**
   - Remove SEs from Table 1 output (since the true table doesn’t show them), or explicitly flag them as “not in published table.”

If you want, paste (or describe) the **exact coding rules** you used for: (a) the DV, (b) income per capita, (c) race/ethnicity categories, and (d) political intolerance scale—and I can pinpoint which of those is most likely responsible for the sign flips and N losses.
