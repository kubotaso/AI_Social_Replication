Score: 32/100
============================================================

Below is a term-by-term audit of the **Generated Results** against the **True Results (Table 1)**, covering **fit statistics, N, coefficients (β), constants, and stars/interpretation**. I also explain what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the table.

---

## 1) Model fit / sample size mismatches

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your model frame is dropping ~40 extra cases. Ensure you’re using the *same* missing-data handling and the same variable coding as the paper. At minimum:
    - restrict to **GSS 1993** only (if not already),
    - use the paper’s inclusion rules for valid values (often GSS uses special codes like 8/9/98/99 that must be set to missing consistently),
    - don’t accidentally require nonmissingness on variables not in Model 1.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **R² 0.088**, Adj **0.085**
  - True: **R² 0.107**, Adj **0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once N and coding match, R² should move closer. Also verify you are regressing the correct dependent variable and using **OLS with the same weights (if any)** as the paper.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is a major discrepancy. You are losing ~249 cases beyond what Table 1 used. Likely causes:
  1) You are listwise-deleting on something not in Model 2 (e.g., `pol_intol`), or
  2) you created race/religion dummies from multiple items and introduced missingness incorrectly, or
  3) you filtered to a subset unintentionally.
  
  Concretely: build Model 2’s analysis dataset using **only** Model 2 variables for listwise deletion.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.139 / 0.120**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Again, this should improve once the sample and coding match.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Your `pol_intol` missingness is extremely high in your output (47% missing). The paper’s Model 3 retains 503 cases, so either:
  - you constructed `pol_intol` differently (too many values set to missing), or
  - you’re using a stricter coding rule than the paper, or
  - you are inadvertently requiring nonmissingness on additional items (e.g., components of `pol_intol`) rather than the final scale.

- **R² / Adj R²**
  - Generated: **0.149 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Matching N + reconstructing `pol_intol` the way the paper did is essential; your adjusted R² is far too low partly because N is far smaller and you have many predictors.

---

## 2) Variable name / dependent variable alignment issues

### Dependent variable label mismatch
- True DV: **Number of music genres disliked**
- Generated output references: `num_genres_disliked` (in missingness) which *sounds* correct, but your Model tables don’t explicitly name the DV.
- **Fix:** Confirm the regression DV is exactly the paper’s constructed measure (same genres, same coding of “dislike,” same handling of “don’t know,” etc.). If your DV construction differs, coefficients and constants will not match.

### Political intolerance scale range
- Generated term label: **“Political intolerance (0–15)”**
- True: “Political intolerance” (scale not shown in the excerpt, but coefficient is for that measure)
- **Fix:** Ensure the scale construction matches the paper:
  - same items,
  - same response coding,
  - same additive range,
  - same missing-data rule for the scale (e.g., allow 1 item missing vs require complete).

Given your huge missingness, the scale construction is a prime suspect.

---

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches, by model (Table 1 standardized coefficients)

**Key point:** Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**, not unstandardized b. Your generated tables show both `b` and `beta`, but your “Table1style” is using the **beta column** (good). The problem is: your **beta values do not match the true β values**.

### Model 1 (SES): β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (ok-ish) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | slightly high |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | too low |

**Fix(es):**
- Once you match sample (N=787) and coding, Education/constant should move.
- Verify education is in **years** and consistent with paper (some GSS education variables differ: years vs degree categories).
- Constant mismatch can also come from:
  - DV construction differences,
  - centering/standardization mishandling (constants should be **unstandardized** in Table 1).

### Model 2 (Demographic): β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.265*** | **-0.246*** | too negative |
| Income pc | **-0.051** | **-0.054** | slightly off |
| Prestige | **-0.011** | **-0.006** | too negative |
| Female | **-0.085***? | **-0.083***? | close on β, but see stars below |
| Age | **0.103***? | **0.140*** | much too small |
| Black | **0.100** | **0.029** | far too large |
| Hispanic | **0.074** | **-0.029** | wrong sign |
| Other race | **-0.027** | **0.005** | wrong sign |
| Cons Prot | **0.087** | **0.059** | too large |
| No religion | **-0.015** | **-0.012** | close |
| Southern | **0.061** | **0.097** | too small |
| Constant | **8.675** | **8.507** | off |
| R² | **0.139** | **0.151** | off |
| N | **507** | **756** | very off |

**Fix(es):**
- The **race dummies** are likely not defined the same way as the paper (or reference category differs).
  - If your reference group differs (e.g., “White” vs “non-Black” or if Hispanic is treated as race vs ethnicity), you can get sign flips and magnitude differences.
  - **Fix:** replicate the paper’s dummy construction:
    - confirm whether “Hispanic” is treated as a separate dummy *in addition to* race, or mutually exclusive race categories,
    - ensure the omitted/reference category matches the paper (usually White, non-Hispanic, non-Other).
- **Age** being much smaller and **Black/Hispanic** being wildly different strongly suggests **sample composition** differs (your N is much smaller and likely selective).
  - **Fix:** correct listwise deletion and ensure you’re using the correct year/sample.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.155***? | **-0.151** | close (stars differ; see below) |
| Income pc | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | huge mismatch (much too negative) |
| Prestige | **-0.015** | **-0.022** | moderate mismatch |
| Female | **-0.127** | **-0.095** | too negative |
| Age | **0.091** | **0.110** | too small |
| Black | **0.060** | **0.049** | close |
| Hispanic | **-0.030** | **0.031** | wrong sign |
| Other race | **0.053** | **0.053** | matches (good) |
| Cons Prot | **0.036** | **0.066** | too small |
| No religion | **0.023** | **0.024** | matches |
| Southern | **0.068** | **0.121** | too small |
| Political intolerance | **0.184** | **0.164** | too large |
| Constant | **7.999** | **6.516** | very off |
| N | **286** | **503** | very off |
| R² / Adj R² | **0.149 / 0.111** | **0.169 / 0.148** | off |

**Fix(es):**
- Biggest red flags:
  1) **Income β** is nowhere near (−0.052 vs −0.009)
  2) **Constant** is far off (7.999 vs 6.516)
  3) **N** is far off (286 vs 503)
  4) Hispanic sign flip again
- These point to **different sample + different coding of key covariates** (income, Hispanic) and/or DV scale differences.
- **Fix:** rebuild Model 3 dataset to match Table 1:
  - listwise delete only on Model 3 variables,
  - correct `pol_intol` construction,
  - verify income per capita calculation and missing codes,
  - verify Hispanic dummy definition/reference category.

## 4) Significance stars mismatches (interpretation errors)

Because p-values depend on SEs and N, if your N is wrong your stars will be wrong. Still, there are **direct star mismatches** versus Table 1:

### Model 2
- **Age**
  - Generated: `Age` has `*` (p≈0.019)
  - True: `Age` is **0.140*** (p < .001)
  - **Fix:** N/coding; your effect is smaller and less significant.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: not significant (p≈0.161)
  - True: **0.097**\*\* (p < .01)
  - **Fix:** again sample/coding.

### Model 3
- **Education**
  - Generated: `*` (p≈0.028)
  - True: **-0.151**\*\* (p < .01)
  - **Fix:** sample size (power) and/or slight coefficient difference.

- **Political intolerance**
  - Generated: ** (p≈0.0038)
  - True: *** (p < .001)
  - **Fix:** with N=503 (not 286), it may become more significant and/or coefficient differs.

Also note: your “Table1style” uses β with stars based on your computed p-values; but the paper’s stars reflect *their* p-values in their sample/specification. You can’t match stars unless you match the underlying model exactly.

---

## 5) Standard errors: conceptual mismatch with the “True Results”

- Generated results include p-values (thus SEs exist internally), but you did **not** print SEs in the coefficient tables.
- The True Results explicitly note **SE are not reported in Table 1**.
- **Mismatch:** If your task is to match the paper, you should not present SEs as “true” benchmarks; instead match β, constants, R², N, and stars.
- **Fix:** If you want your output to mirror Table 1, format it as:
  - standardized β + stars,
  - constant unstandardized,
  - R², Adj R², N,
  - omit SEs.

(If you *must* compare SEs, you need access to the paper’s SEs, which Table 1 doesn’t provide.)

---

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the paper

1) **Use the same analytic sample as the paper**
   - Filter to **GSS 1993**.
   - Apply the same eligibility rules (e.g., valid responses only).
   - For each model, perform **listwise deletion only on that model’s variables**.

2) **Reconstruct key variables exactly**
   - **DV (num genres disliked):** same genres, same “disliked” coding, same missing handling.
   - **Income per capita:** confirm definition (household income divided by household size?) and how zeros/top-codes are handled.
   - **Race/ethnicity dummies:** match mutually exclusive vs non-exclusive scheme and reference category.
   - **Political intolerance scale:** match item set, scoring, and missing rule (this is likely driving your Model 3 N collapse).

3) **Compute standardized coefficients the same way**
   - Table 1 β are standardized OLS coefficients. Ensure you compute β from the same regression (not standardizing after dropping different cases, not using different SD definitions).
   - Don’t standardize the constant.

4) **Weights / design effects (if used by the paper)**
   - If the paper used GSS weights (common), unweighted replication will shift coefficients and fit. Verify and apply the same weight variable and method.

## 7) Quick checklist of “every mismatch” (summary)

### Fit / N
- Model 1: N, R², Adj R² mismatch
- Model 2: N, R², Adj R² mismatch (large)
- Model 3: N, R², Adj R² mismatch (very large)

### Coefficients (β)
- Model 1: Education, Prestige, Constant mismatch
- Model 2: Education, Income, Prestige, Age, Black, Hispanic (sign), Other race (sign), Cons Prot, Southern, Constant mismatch
- Model 3: Income (major), Female, Age, Hispanic (sign), Cons Prot, Southern, Political intolerance, Constant mismatch

### Stars / interpretation
- Model 2: Age and Southern significance mismatched
- Model 3: Education and Political intolerance significance mismatched

### Presentation
- Generated tables mix b/beta/p; Table 1 is β + stars, constant unstd, no SE.

If you paste your code (or at least: variable construction for DV, `inc_pc`, race/Hispanic dummies, and `pol_intol`, plus your missing-value recodes and any weights), I can pinpoint exactly which line(s) are causing the N collapse and the sign reversals (especially Hispanic) and specify the exact corrections.
