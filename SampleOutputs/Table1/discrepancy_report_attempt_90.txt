## 1) Fit statistics (n, R², adj. R²): all three models mismatch

### Model 1 (SES)
- **n**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your analytic sample is smaller than the paper’s. Align inclusion criteria and missing-data handling to match the paper (likely listwise deletion on *only* the variables in Model 1, using the same coding/filters as the authors). Check you didn’t (a) unnecessarily require nonmissing values for variables not in Model 1, or (b) drop cases due to recoding mistakes (e.g., income per capita computed only for a subset).

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **0.088 / 0.085**
  - True: **0.107 / 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the sample and coding match, R² should move closer. Also ensure you are using **OLS with the same weights/design** as the paper (many GSS analyses use weights). A weights mismatch alone can shift R² and coefficients.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **n**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** Huge discrepancy indicates you are inadvertently imposing extra missingness restrictions (most commonly: carrying forward missingness from the **political intolerance** variable into Model 2, or using a single “complete cases across all variables for all models” dataset).  
  - Concretely: build each model on its own complete-case subset:
    - Model 1 complete cases: outcome + SES vars
    - Model 2 complete cases: outcome + SES + demographic vars
    - Model 3 complete cases: outcome + SES + demographic + intolerance
  - Your own missingness table shows **pol_intol missing ~47%**; if you accidentally required nonmissing pol_intol in Model 2, your n would collapse—exactly what we see.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **0.135 / 0.118**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Will likely correct once **n** and coding/weights match.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **n**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Same issue—your sample is far smaller than even the “pol_intol-complete” expectation. Given your missingness report, if the full N is ~1606 and pol_intol is nonmissing for 850, getting **286** suggests you are additionally dropping on race variables or other recodes (you show race missingness ~35%). The paper’s Model 3 n=503 implies they did **not** lose an extra ~200 cases beyond intolerance missingness to race coding. That points to a coding mismatch: see “Other race dropped” below.

---

## 2) Variable name / inclusion mismatches: “Other race” is incorrectly handled and dropped

### “Other race” variable
- Generated:
  - Model 2: **Other race = NaN; dropped_predictors = otherrace**
  - Model 3: **Other race = NaN; dropped_predictors = otherrace**
- True:
  - Model 2: **Other race β = 0.005**
  - Model 3: **Other race β = 0.053**

**What’s wrong:** Your regression software is **dropping “otherrace”** (perfect collinearity, zero variance, or all missing after your filtering). This also likely contributes to the very small n (because your race variables show ~35% missing; the paper’s n suggests they had usable race indicators for many more cases).

**Fix:**
1. **Recreate race dummies correctly** with a clear reference category (usually White omitted).
   - `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` should be mutually exclusive indicators.
   - Ensure they are coded 0/1, not missing for non-members.
2. **Do not code “not other race” as missing.** It must be 0.
3. Check that “white” is not included as another dummy (or, if it is, drop it). Including all race-category dummies + intercept will force one to drop.
4. After recoding, verify:
   - variance of `otherrace` > 0
   - cross-tabs confirm exclusivity and completeness.

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized β): many are off, and several signs/stars differ

Important: The paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)** and **does not report SEs**. Your generated output mixes **unstandardized b** and **standardized beta**, and you also compute p-values/stars. Comparisons to “True Results” should be done on **beta**, not **b**.

Below I compare **standardized β** (Generated table1_combined vs True).

### Model 1 β (SES)
- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.292***  
  - True: **-0.322***  
  - Fix: sample/weights/coding mismatch (n and R² are off too, consistent with this).
- **Income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.039**
  - True: **-0.037**
  - This is close; likely OK once sample matches.
- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **0.020**
  - True: **0.016**
  - Close-ish; likely sample/weights.

- **Constant (unstandardized)**
  - Generated: **10.638**
  - True: **10.920**
  - Fix: again points to sample/coding differences; constant is sensitive to coding and case selection.

### Model 2 β (Demographic): multiple notable mismatches
- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.264***  
  - True: **-0.246***  
  - Direction/stars match; magnitude off.
- **Income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.053**
  - True: **-0.054**
  - Very close.
- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **-0.016**
  - True: **-0.006**
  - Your effect is more negative.
- **Female**
  - Generated: **-0.090***? (your table shows `-0.090*`; model2_full p=0.034 so one star)
  - True: **-0.083***? (true shows `-0.083*`)
  - Close; likely resolves with sample.
- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.104***? (p=0.018 → *)
  - True: **0.140*** (***)
  - Big mismatch in magnitude and significance.
  - Fix: sample mismatch is severe here (507 vs 756). Age’s estimate is sensitive to who is included; also could indicate different age coding (e.g., age in years vs grouped/centered).
- **Black**
  - Generated: **0.043** (and p=0.87!)
  - True: **0.029**
  - Both small; your p-value being huge is consistent with much smaller n and/or inflated SE due to missingness patterns.
- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **0.030**
  - True: **-0.029**  **SIGN MISMATCH**
  - Fix: race coding/reference group problems are the prime suspect. If your Hispanic dummy is miscoded (e.g., reversed, or conflated with “Spanish language” variable, or missingness treated as 1), the sign can flip.
- **Other race**
  - Generated: **dropped/blank**
  - True: **0.005**
  - Fix: recode and include properly (see above).
- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated: **0.090**
  - True: **0.059**
  - Magnitude mismatch; could be coding difference in the denomination variable (who counts as “conservative Protestant”).
- **No religion**
  - Generated: **-0.019**
  - True: **-0.012**
  - Close.
- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.063**
  - True: **0.097** **(and true is significant **)**
  - Your estimate is smaller and not significant; again consistent with sample mismatch and possibly different “South” definition.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **9.285**
  - True: **8.507**
  - Big mismatch: again indicates different sample and/or different variable codings (especially dummies).

### Model 3 β (Political intolerance): several mismatches including significance
- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.157***
  - True: **-0.151** (true says **)
  - Magnitudes close; stars differ.
- **Income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.050**
  - True: **-0.009**  **BIG mismatch**
  - Fix: likely you are standardizing differently and/or computing income per capita differently than the authors (e.g., dividing by household size vs using a different equivalence scale; handling of top-codes; log transform). The paper’s β is near zero; yours is moderately negative.
- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **-0.011**
  - True: **-0.022**
  - Some difference.
- **Female**
  - Generated: **-0.122***
  - True: **-0.095* **
  - Yours is stronger.
- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.083 (ns)**
  - True: **0.110* **
  - Mismatch likely due to n (286 vs 503) and possibly age coding.
- **Black**
  - Generated: **0.107**
  - True: **0.049**
  - Mismatch; race coding issues + sample.
- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **0.028**
  - True: **0.031**
  - Close (note Model 2 sign issue still stands).
- **Other race**
  - Generated: dropped/blank
  - True: **0.053**
  - Fix: recode/include.
- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated: **0.037**
  - True: **0.066**
- **No religion**
  - Generated: **0.024**
  - True: **0.024**
  - Matches.
- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.065**
  - True: **0.121** **(true significant **)**
- **Political intolerance**
  - Generated: **0.190** (**) with p=0.00265
  - True: **0.164***  
  - Magnitude differs and your significance is weaker (**, not ***).
  - Fix: sample mismatch (286 vs 503) + possibly different scaling of intolerance (paper likely uses the same 0–15 but verify you didn’t rescale or reverse-code items).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **7.360**
  - True: **6.516**
  - Again suggests sample/coding differences.

## 4) Standard errors: your generated SEs are not comparable to the “true” table

- Generated results include p-values and implicitly SEs (though not printed), but the paper table **does not report SEs** at all.
- This is not a “mismatch” per se, but it becomes one if you claim you are reproducing the table exactly.

**Fix options:**
1. If the goal is to match the paper’s Table 1: **report only standardized β and stars**, omit SE/p.
2. If you want to report SEs anyway: label your table clearly as “replication with SEs (not in original table)” and don’t treat SE differences as replication failures.

---

## 5) Interpretation/reporting mismatches (stars and what is being reported)

### Mixing b and β
- The paper’s table uses **standardized coefficients (β)**; your `model*_full` tables emphasize **unstandardized b** but also show β.
- Your combined table reports β, which is correct for comparison—**but** your narrative (if any) must consistently interpret β as “SD change in outcome per SD change in predictor.”

**Fix:** In the final write-up:
- Use β for comparing effect sizes across predictors and matching the paper.
- Mention constants are unstandardized.

### Significance stars differ in several places
Examples:
- Model 3 political intolerance: true ***, generated **.
- Model 3 education: true **, generated *.
- Model 2 age: true ***, generated *.
- Model 2 southern: true **, generated none.

**Fix:** Stars will not match until:
1. n matches (biggest driver),
2. variables are coded the same,
3. same weighting/design and same two-tailed tests are used.

---

## 6) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Model-specific listwise deletion**
   - Fit Model 1 on complete cases for: `num_genres_disliked, educ_yrs, inc_pc, prestg80_v`
   - Fit Model 2 on complete cases for Model 2 variables only (do **not** require `pol_intol`)
   - Fit Model 3 on complete cases for Model 3 variables

2. **Fix race dummies**
   - Ensure `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` are 0/1 with 0 as “not that group”
   - Omit the reference group (White) to avoid collinearity
   - Confirm `otherrace` is not all-missing or constant

3. **Verify variable coding matches the paper**
   - Age in years (not centered unless the paper did)
   - Female coding (1=female)
   - Southern definition (Census South indicator consistent with paper)
   - Conservative Protestant and No religion definitions consistent with the original coding scheme used by the authors

4. **Match the construction of key composites**
   - **Income per capita:** same formula and handling of missing household size; same top-codes; same transformation (none vs log).
   - **Political intolerance scale (0–15):** confirm item selection, direction, and summation match.

5. **Weights / design**
   - Check whether the paper used a GSS weight (e.g., WTSSALL or similar). If yes, refit using the same weight; if no, don’t weight.

6. **Standardize to compute β the same way**
   - Standardized coefficients should come from either:
     - fitting OLS on z-scored variables (excluding dummies unless the paper standardized them too), or
     - post-hoc standardization consistent with the paper.
   - The paper reports β for dummies too (female, race, etc.), which implies they *did* standardize those 0/1 variables in the usual way (SD-based). Make sure your β computation does the same.

If you tell me what code/package produced the generated tables (R `lm` + `lm.beta`? Python statsmodels?), I can point to the exact lines that typically cause (a) “complete cases across all models” and (b) dummy-variable dropping for collinearity.
