Score: 28/100
============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics and sample sizes: mismatches

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s. Align the **casewise deletion rules** and the **construction of variables** (especially `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, and the DV). The paper’s Model 1 appears to retain 787 cases; your pipeline is dropping an extra 40. Verify:
    - you are using **GSS 1993 only**,
    - the DV coding matches the paper,
    - missing codes (e.g., DK/NA/IAP) are consistently recoded to NA,
    - you are not inadvertently requiring nonmissingness on variables not in Model 1.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **R² 0.088**, **Adj R² 0.085**
  - True: **R² 0.107**, **Adj R² 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once the estimation sample and variable coding match, R² should move. If not, your **DV or one/more predictors are not coded identically** (common culprits: income per capita scaling, prestige measure version, and education top-coding/years).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is a major discrepancy. Your “missingness” table shows large missingness for `hispanic` (35%), but not enough to collapse N to 507 if the paper has 756. This strongly suggests you are:
    - using a **different Hispanic variable** (or coding many cases to missing that the paper keeps), and/or
    - creating race/ethnicity dummies incorrectly (e.g., setting `hispanic` to NA unless explicitly coded, instead of coding non-Hispanic as 0).
  - Actionable check: In Model 2, every dummy should be **0/1 with 0 meaning “not in group”**, not missing for “not asked/skip” unless the paper also dropped them.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **0.139 / 0.120**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
  - **Fix:** Resolve sample/coding first. Your Adj R² is far too low given True R² and N; that’s consistent with the wrong N and/or wrong regressors.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Again, huge over-deletion. Your `pol_intol` missingness is ~47%, but starting from 1606 that still leaves ~850 nonmissing, so getting **286** implies you are additionally dropping many cases via:
    - requiring complete data on some variable not in the true model,
    - or constructing `pol_intol` in a way that produces lots of NAs beyond those in the paper,
    - or using listwise deletion after merging/subsetting incorrectly.
  - The paper’s Model 3 uses **503** cases; replicate that by matching its political intolerance measure construction and missing handling.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **0.149 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
  - **Fix:** Sample/coding mismatch is the primary driver here.

---

## 2) Variable names / included variables: mismatches

### DV labeling
- Generated models refer to “num_genres_disliked” but the table caption in the true results is **Number of Music Genres Disliked** (fine substantively).
- **Fix:** Ensure the DV is computed exactly as in the paper (same genre items, same “dislike” threshold, same handling of missing per item). If your DV counts are based on a different set of genre questions or treat “neutral” differently, coefficients/R² will diverge.

### Political intolerance variable
- Generated: **“Political intolerance (0–15)”**
- True: **Political intolerance** (no scale shown in the coefficient table)
- **Fix:** The scale itself isn’t the issue, but it’s a warning sign: you may have rescaled or summed items differently than the paper. Reconstruct the political intolerance index exactly as the paper did (items included, coding direction, range, and whether mean vs sum).

---

## 3) Coefficients (standardized β) and constants: mismatches by model

Important: **Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)** and **constants unstandardized**. Your `table_style` uses the **beta** column (good), but many betas don’t match the true betas, and your **constants** also differ.

### Model 1 (SES)
**Betas**
- Education:
  - Generated β: **-0.292***  
  - True β: **-0.322***  
  - **Fix:** Likely education coding (years) differs, or sample differs (N mismatch). Fix sample and confirm education is continuous years as in GSS and as in the paper.

- Income per capita:
  - Generated β: **-0.039**
  - True β: **-0.037**
  - Small difference; likely resolves with sample/coding alignment.

- Occupational prestige:
  - Generated β: **0.020**
  - True β: **0.016**
  - Small difference; again likely sample/coding.

**Constant**
- Generated: **10.638**
- True: **10.920**
- **Fix:** constant depends on unstandardized DV and predictor coding + sample. If DV construction differs even slightly, the intercept can shift a lot.

**R²**
- Generated: 0.088 vs True 0.107 (see above).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
**Betas with sign and/or magnitude problems**
- Education:
  - Generated: **-0.265*** vs True **-0.246*** (moderate mismatch)

- Income per capita:
  - Generated: **-0.051** vs True **-0.054** (small mismatch)

- Occupational prestige:
  - Generated: **-0.011** vs True **-0.006** (small mismatch)

- Female:
  - Generated: **-0.085***? (your table has -0.085*; model shows p=.044 so one star) vs True **-0.083*** (close)

- **Age (major mismatch)**
  - Generated β: **0.103*** (p=.019, only *)
  - True β: **0.140*** (***)
  - **Fix:** This is not just sampling error; likely **age coding differs** (e.g., using age categories, using `age_v` that is top-coded or missing-coded wrong), or the smaller N is changing the estimate and SE materially. Match the paper’s age variable and restore N=756.

- **Hispanic (sign mismatch)**
  - Generated β: **+0.074**
  - True β: **-0.029**
  - **Fix:** Almost certainly a **dummy coding/reference group error**.
    - In the paper, “Hispanic” is a category (β negative, small).
    - Your generated model likely codes `hispanic` as something else (e.g., “Spanish language interview” / “Hispanic origin asked only in some forms” / or NA handling treating non-Hispanic as missing).
    - Correct approach: create mutually exclusive race/ethnicity indicators exactly as paper: Black, Hispanic, Other race, with **White non-Hispanic as reference** (or whatever the paper uses). Ensure Hispanics are not simultaneously counted in white/black unless the paper did so.

- **Other race (sign mismatch)**
  - Generated β: **-0.027**
  - True β: **+0.005**
  - **Fix:** Same issue: race dummy construction.

- Conservative Protestant:
  - Generated β: **0.087** vs True **0.059** (mismatch)

- No religion:
  - Generated β: **-0.015** vs True **-0.012** (small)

- **Southern (magnitude + significance mismatch)**
  - Generated β: **0.061** (ns)
  - True β: **0.097** (**)
  - **Fix:** Region coding differs (e.g., using a different “South” definition) and/or N mismatch.

**Constant**
- Generated: **8.675**
- True: **8.507**
- Fix via aligning DV/predictors/sample.

**R²**
- Generated: 0.139 vs True 0.151 (again sample/coding).

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
**Betas**
- Education:
  - Generated: **-0.155*** (p=.028, so *) vs True **-0.151** (**)  
  - **Fix:** magnitude close; significance differs due to your much smaller N (286). Restore N≈503 to approach the paper’s significance.

- **Income per capita (major mismatch)**
  - Generated β: **-0.052**
  - True β: **-0.009**
  - **Fix:** This is substantial. It points to **income-per-capita scaling/construction** being different from the paper’s, *and/or* collinearity/sample issues from N=286.
    - Ensure income per capita is computed the same way (household income divided by household size? equivalized? logged?), and that you didn’t accidentally use raw income or a differently transformed measure in Model 3 vs Models 1–2.

- Occupational prestige:
  - Generated β: **-0.015** vs True **-0.022** (small/moderate)

- Female:
  - Generated β: **-0.127*** vs True **-0.095*** (mismatch)

- **Age**
  - Generated β: **0.091** (ns) vs True **0.110*** (*)
  - Fix: age coding + restore N.

- **Black**
  - Generated β: **0.060** vs True **0.049** (close)

- **Hispanic (sign mismatch)**
  - Generated β: **-0.030**
  - True β: **+0.031**
  - Fix: race/ethnicity dummy coding as above.

- Other race:
  - Generated β: **0.053**
  - True β: **0.053**
  - This one matches.

- Conservative Protestant:
  - Generated β: **0.036**
  - True β: **0.066**
  - Mismatch; could be coding of denomination variable.

- No religion:
  - Generated β: **0.023**
  - True β: **0.024**
  - Matches closely.

- **Southern (mismatch + significance)**
  - Generated β: **0.068** (ns)
  - True β: **0.121** (**)
  - Fix: south coding and/or N.

- Political intolerance:
  - Generated β: **0.184** (**) with p=.0038
  - True β: **0.164** (***)  
  - **Fix:** magnitude somewhat higher; significance star differs because your p-value is between .001 and .01 whereas the paper reports <.001. Restoring N and reconstructing intolerance index should move both β and p.

**Constant**
- Generated: **7.999**
- True: **6.516**
- This is very large. Strongly suggests **DV and/or key predictors are coded/scaled differently** (especially political intolerance and income per capita), not just sampling variation.

**R²**
- Generated 0.149 vs True 0.169.

---

## 4) Standard errors: mismatch in what’s reported

- Generated output includes p-values and (implicitly) SEs were used to compute them.
- True Table 1 explicitly: **SEs are not reported**.
- **Fix (reporting):** If your goal is to “match Table 1,” do **not present SEs**; present **standardized β** and stars using the paper’s thresholds. If you want to keep inferential stats, label them as your computed SEs/p-values, but then it will not match the table format.

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance coding mismatches

Several stars differ because your N is far smaller (esp. Model 2/3), inflating SEs and changing p-values:
- Age in Model 2: paper **0.140*** vs your **0.103*** with only *
- Political intolerance in Model 3: paper *** vs your **

**Fix:** Restore the paper’s N by matching variable construction and missing-data handling; then recompute.

---

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Replicate the paper’s analytic sample per model**
   - Build each model’s dataset by selecting **only** the variables in that model + the DV, then listwise delete.
   - Do *not* carry forward extra missingness from variables not included in that model.
   - Target Ns: **787**, **756**, **503**.

2. **Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies**
   - Ensure `hispanic` is coded **0/1 for all respondents** where the paper retains them.
   - Use the same reference category as the paper (likely White non-Hispanic).
   - Ensure “Other race” is coded consistently and not overlapping incorrectly.
   - The sign flips for Hispanic in Models 2 and 3 are the clearest symptom of mis-coding.

3. **Verify age and south coding**
   - Age should be the standard continuous GSS age variable with correct missing recode.
   - South should match the paper’s definition (often Census South). Don’t use an alternative region variable without checking.

4. **Reconstruct income per capita exactly**
   - Confirm whether the paper uses:
     - raw household income / household size,
     - an equivalence scale,
     - logging,
     - inflation adjustment,
     - and how zero/negative/unknown incomes are handled.
   - The Model 3 income β mismatch (-0.052 vs -0.009) suggests you are not using the same measure.

5. **Reconstruct political intolerance index identically**
   - Match items, coding direction, and aggregation (sum vs mean).
   - Confirm whether “don’t know” is treated as missing and whether partial scales are allowed (paper likely uses complete-case for the scale).

6. **Output the same estimand as the table**
   - Report **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors.
   - Keep **constant unstandardized**.
   - Do not include SEs if the goal is to match Table 1; include stars only.

If you share your variable construction code (especially for DV, `inc_pc`, `hispanic`/race, and `pol_intol`) I can pinpoint exactly which recodes are causing the N collapses and the Hispanic/sign reversals.
