Score: 39/100
============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of mismatches between your **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, plus what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the printed table.

---

## 1) Sample size (N) mismatches — **major**

### What you generated
- Model 1 N = **758**
- Model 2 N = **523**
- Model 3 N = **351**

### True Table 1
- Model 1 N = **787**
- Model 2 N = **756**
- Model 3 N = **503**

### Why this is happening (based on your diagnostics)
Your code is doing **listwise deletion** using your constructed variables, and it is excluding many more cases than Table 1 did.

Concrete problems visible in your own “missingness” sections:
- **Hispanic** has **281 missing** (huge). That alone collapses Model 2 from ~756 to 523.
- **Political intolerance** has **302 missing**, collapsing Model 3 from 503 to 351.
- You are also restricting to **year 1993** and to “complete_music_18” (893), which may or may not match the authors’ analytic restriction, but your final N’s clearly do not match theirs.

### How to fix
To match Table 1, you need to replicate the **authors’ sample construction and missing-data rules**, not impose new ones:

1) **Recreate race/ethnicity dummies exactly as the authors did**
- Your diagnostics show a rule: `ETHNIC==1 => hispanic=1; ETHNIC !=1 => 0; ETHNIC missing => NA`.
- Table 1’s N implies they likely did **not** treat “not asked / missing ETHNIC” as NA in a way that drops hundreds of cases.
- Common fixes:
  - Build Hispanic from a different source variable (e.g., a separate HISPANIC indicator), or
  - Code Hispanic missing as **0** when race is observed and ETHNIC is missing but implies non-Hispanic in that survey design, or
  - Use the same “valid skip” handling as the PDF’s appendix/codebook.

2) **Political intolerance construction is stricter than the authors’**
- You require **>=10 answered items** out of 15; that may be stricter than Table 1.
- Fix by matching their scale rule exactly (e.g., allow fewer answered items, use mean of available items, or use an item subset). Table 1’s N=503 suggests far fewer exclusions.

3) **Do not apply additional filters not used in Table 1**
- If Table 1 does not restrict to only fully complete “music_18”, remove that restriction.
- Confirm whether Table 1 uses **all years** or only 1993. Your `N_year_1993=1606` suggests you filtered; the printed table’s N’s must be matched to the same restriction.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas) — **per-variable audit**

All coefficients in Table 1 are **standardized**. Your `coefficients_long` says you are also reporting standardized betas (“z-scored y and X”), so the remaining differences are not a “standardized vs unstandardized” issue—they come from **different samples and/or different variable coding**.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated | True | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.332*** | **-0.322*** | mismatch (too negative) |
| income_pc | **-0.034** | **-0.037** | mismatch (small) |
| prestg80 | **0.029** | **0.016** | mismatch (notably larger) |
| Constant | **11.086** | **10.920** | mismatch |

**Fix:** Once you match **N=787** and variable coding, these should move toward the printed values. The prestige discrepancy (0.029 vs 0.016) especially suggests either (a) a different prestige variable coding/imputation, or (b) sample selection differences.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated | True | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.302*** | **-0.246*** | mismatch (much too negative) |
| income_pc | **-0.057** | **-0.054** | close, slight mismatch |
| prestg80 | **-0.007** | **-0.006** | close |
| female | **-0.078** (no star) | **-0.083*** | mismatch in coef + significance |
| age | **0.109*** (only *) | **0.140*** | mismatch (too small, wrong sig level) |
| black | **0.053** | **0.029** | mismatch |
| hispanic | **-0.017** | **-0.029** | mismatch |
| other_race | **-0.016** | **0.005** | **sign mismatch** |
| conservative_protestant | **0.040** | **0.059** | mismatch |
| no_religion | **-0.016** | **-0.012** | small mismatch |
| southern | **0.079** (no star) | **0.097**** | mismatch in coef + significance |
| Constant | **10.089** | **8.507** | big mismatch |

**Fix:** This model’s collapse to **N=523** is the biggest driver. With the wrong N and likely wrong coding for Hispanic/other_race, the whole coefficient pattern shifts (including intercept).

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated | True | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | **-0.150*** (1 star) | **-0.151**** (2 stars) | coef matches, sig mismatch |
| income_pc | **-0.066** | **-0.009** | **major mismatch** |
| prestg80 | **0.005** | **-0.022** | sign mismatch |
| female | **-0.115*** | **-0.095*** | mismatch |
| age | **0.091** (no star) | **0.110*** | mismatch |
| black | **0.064** | **0.049** | mismatch |
| hispanic | **0.016** | **0.031** | mismatch |
| other_race | **0.015** | **0.053** | mismatch |
| conservative_protestant | **0.004** | **0.066** | **major mismatch** |
| no_religion | **0.008** | **0.024** | mismatch |
| southern | **0.078** | **0.121**** | mismatch |
| political_intolerance | **0.209*** | **0.164*** | mismatch (too large) |
| Constant | **7.145** | **6.516** | mismatch |

**Fix:** Again, your **N=351 vs 503** plus your intolerance scale construction is almost certainly the cause. The income and religion effects being wildly off is consistent with selection bias from dropping 150+ additional cases.

## 3) R² and Adjusted R² mismatches

### Generated
- Model 1 R² 0.109, Adj 0.105 (close)
- Model 2 R² 0.157, Adj 0.139 (R² too high)
- Model 3 R² 0.151, Adj 0.121 (**much lower** than true)

### True
- Model 1 R² 0.107, Adj 0.104
- Model 2 R² 0.151, Adj 0.139
- Model 3 R² 0.169, Adj 0.148

**Fix:** Once samples and variable construction match, these should align. Your Model 3 especially indicates you’re fitting a different model on a different subset (and possibly with a different intolerance variable).

---

## 4) Standard errors: your table prints them but True Table 1 does not

### Mismatch
- Your “table1_style” visually includes a second line that looks like **standard errors** under coefficients.
- True Table 1 explicitly: **standardized coefficients only; no standard errors printed**.

### Fix
- Remove SEs from the reproduction table if the goal is to match the PDF.
- If you still want SEs for your own work, keep them in a separate appendix table, but don’t claim they reproduce Table 1.

---

## 5) Significance stars don’t match (interpretation mismatch)

Even when coefficients are close (e.g., education in Model 3), your stars differ. That’s expected if:
- N differs (affects SEs/p-values),
- you are using a different test (robust vs classical),
- you are standardizing within different samples,
- or you’re using different missing data handling.

**Fix:**
- Use **the same N** as Table 1.
- Use **two-tailed tests** and the same α cutoffs (you say you do, but your p-values are based on your own samples).
- Confirm whether the authors used robust SEs; Table 1 doesn’t print SEs, so you must infer from their replication materials if available.

---

## 6) Variable-name mismatches (minor, but still discrepancies)

Your names vs Table 1 labels:
- `educ` → Education (fine)
- `income_pc` → Household income per capita (fine if constructed identically)
- `prestg80` → Occupational prestige (fine if correct measure)
- `conservative_protestant` and `no_religion` appear aligned
- Race/ethnicity: your `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` must match the paper’s coding and reference category.

**Potential hidden mismatch:** reference group coding.
- If your dummies are not mutually exclusive or the omitted category differs (e.g., White non-Hispanic vs White including Hispanics), coefficients will not match.

**Fix:** Ensure the same **reference category** as the paper (typically White, non-Hispanic, non-Black, non-other; and a specific religion reference).

---

## What you should change (action checklist)

1) **Rebuild the analytic sample to hit the printed N’s**:
   - Model 1: 787
   - Model 2: 756
   - Model 3: 503

2) **Fix Hispanic missingness**:
   - Do not drop 281 cases due to `hispanic` being NA unless the authors did.
   - Recode according to survey skip logic / codebook so those cases remain in Model 2/3.

3) **Fix political intolerance scale** to match the paper:
   - Match item list, coding direction, and minimum answered items (your “>=10” rule is likely wrong).
   - Confirm whether they used sum vs mean; standardization will differ slightly too.

4) **Remove SEs from the reproduction table** (Table 1 in PDF doesn’t include them).

5) **Confirm the same filters** (year restriction, complete DV construction, etc.) used by the paper; remove extra restrictions.

If you share (a) your code that creates `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`, and (b) the exact dataset/source (GSS extract details), I can tell you exactly which recodes/filters are causing each N drop and which changes will move each coefficient toward the printed Table 1 values.
