### 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches

**A. DV labeling**
- **Generated:** “DV: Number of music genres disliked” but the working DV column shown is `num_genres_disliked`.
- **True:** “Number of music genres disliked.”
- **Fix:** This is mostly a presentation mismatch. Make the table print the DV name exactly as in the paper (“Number of music genres disliked”) and, if you want, add the internal variable name in a note. No statistical change required.

**B. Predictor naming**
- **Generated terms:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`
- **True (Table 1 labels):** Education; Household income per capita; Occupational prestige; Female; Age; Black; Hispanic; Other race; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern; Political intolerance.
- **Fix:** Only cosmetic, but important for matching: relabel predictors in the output to match the Table 1 wording (e.g., `income_pc` → “Household income per capita”, `prestg80` → “Occupational prestige”).

### 2) Sample-size (N) mismatches (major)

| Model | Generated N | True N | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| SES | 758 | 787 | -29 |
| Demographic | 523 | 756 | -233 |
| Political intolerance | 343 | 503 | -160 |

**Interpretation:** Your generated models are being estimated on much smaller “complete case” subsets than the paper’s. That alone will change standardized betas, constants, and R².

**Likely causes (based on your diagnostics):**
- You appear to be **dropping cases based on intolerance items answered** (`tol_min_answered_rule = 12`). That rule can easily shrink Model 3 and may also propagate to other models if applied too early.
- You are likely doing **listwise deletion across all variables** (or across a wider set than the paper did), and/or using different missing-data coding (e.g., treating “don’t know/refused” differently).
- You might be filtering to a specific year (`N_year_1993 = 1606`) and then further restricting; but your final N’s don’t match the paper’s within that year.

**Fixes to match the paper:**
1. **Apply model-specific listwise deletion** (each model uses its own variables only).  
   - Model 1 should drop missing only on DV + education + income pc + prestige.
   - Model 2 should drop missing only on DV + Model 2 covariates.
   - Model 3 should drop missing only on DV + Model 3 covariates (including intolerance).
2. **Do NOT apply the intolerance “min items answered” rule to Models 1–2.**  
   Only Model 3 should require the intolerance scale to be valid.
3. **Match the paper’s intolerance scale construction rules** exactly (how many items required, how DK/NA treated, whether rescaling/averaging/summing is used). Your own diagnostic suggests you required ≥12 answered items; the paper may have used a different threshold or handled missingness differently.
4. **Reconcile coding of income and prestige** (top-coding, inflation adjustment, etc.) if the paper did any preprocessing—differences there can change who is “missing” as well as standardization.

Until N matches, you should expect widespread coefficient/R² mismatches.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **every coefficient mismatch** between Generated and True (Table 1). (All are standardized betas.)

#### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated | True | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332*** | -0.322*** | too negative |
| HH income pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | slightly off |
| Occ prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | too positive |
| Constant | 11.086 | 10.920 | too high |
| R² | 0.1088 | 0.107 | slightly high |
| Adj R² | 0.1052 | 0.104 | slightly high |

**Fix:** Mainly the **N mismatch** (758 vs 787) and possibly standardization method (see section 5). Once you match sample selection and standardization, these should align closely.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated | True | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.302*** | -0.246*** | far too negative |
| HH income pc | -0.057 | -0.054 | close |
| Occ prestige | -0.007 | -0.006 | close |
| Female | -0.078 | -0.083* | magnitude a bit off; **sig mismatch** (see below) |
| Age | 0.109* | 0.140*** | too small; sig too weak |
| Black | 0.053 | 0.029 | too large |
| Hispanic | -0.017 | -0.029 | too small in magnitude |
| Other race | -0.016 | 0.005 | **sign mismatch** |
| Cons Prot | 0.040 | 0.059 | too small |
| No religion | -0.016 | -0.012 | close |
| Southern | 0.079 | 0.097** | too small; **sig mismatch** |
| Constant | 10.089 | 8.507 | far too high |
| R² | 0.157 | 0.151 | slightly high |
| Adj R² | 0.139 | 0.139 | matches |
| N | 523 | 756 | **massive mismatch** |

**Fix:** This model is the clearest sign you’re estimating on the wrong sample. Get N=756 and re-run; also verify dummy codings/baselines (see section 4), because the **“Other race” sign flip** can arise from different reference category coding.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated | True | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | close, but **sig mismatch** |
| HH income pc | -0.075 | -0.009 | **huge mismatch** |
| Occ prestige | 0.015 | -0.022 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.117* | -0.095* | somewhat too negative |
| Age | 0.080 | 0.110* | too small; **sig mismatch** |
| Black | 0.065 | 0.049 | too large |
| Hispanic | 0.018 | 0.031 | too small |
| Other race | 0.034 | 0.053 | too small |
| Cons Prot | 0.002 | 0.066 | way too small |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.079 | 0.121** | too small; **sig mismatch** |
| Political intolerance | 0.211*** | 0.164*** | too large |
| Constant | 7.237 | 6.516 | too high |
| R² | 0.150 | 0.169 | too low |
| Adj R² | 0.119 | 0.148 | too low |
| N | 343 | 503 | **massive mismatch** |

**Fix:** Again, sample construction and/or intolerance scale construction is not matching the paper. The especially large differences on **income**, **prestige sign**, and **Conservative Protestant** suggest either:
- different handling of missingness (selection effect),
- different coding/baseline for religion,
- or different standardization (computed on a different sample than the regression sample).

---

### 4) Dummy coding / reference-category mismatches (likely)

You have binary indicators: `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, and likely an implicit omitted race category (probably “White”). That is fine—but:

- **Model 2 “Other race” is negative (-0.016) in generated but slightly positive (+0.005) in true.**
- **Fix:** Verify that:
  1. Your categories match theirs (e.g., are Asians included in “other”? are multiracial coded differently?).
  2. You didn’t accidentally include “hispanic” as a race category differently than the paper (some code treats Hispanic as mutually exclusive vs ethnicity overlay).
  3. The omitted/reference category is the same (typically White, non-Hispanic).

Similarly for religion:
- Paper has “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” as dummies; reference is likely “all others” (e.g., mainline Protestant/Catholic/Jewish/other).
- Your **Conservative Protestant** effect collapses in Model 3 (0.002 vs 0.066). That can happen if the reference group composition differs because of sample restriction (again pointing back to N), or if your conservative Protestant coding doesn’t match theirs.
- **Fix:** Recreate religion categories exactly as described in the paper/codebook; ensure the reference group is identical.

Region:
- `southern` is consistently smaller and loses significance in your output.
- **Fix:** Confirm the “South” definition (Census South vs former Confederacy vs something else) and again fix sample selection.

---

### 5) Standard errors and significance-star mismatches (and why they happen)

**Critical discrepancy:**  
- **True Table 1**: *does not report standard errors*. Stars are from the paper’s tests, but SEs are not displayed.
- **Generated table**: appears to show stars and includes some SE-like rows (your table has unlabeled lines under coefficients), and your note says: “stars from raw OLS p-values (SE method may differ from paper).”

So you’re comparing stars that come from **your** p-values to stars in the paper, but:
- the paper’s p-values could be based on a different sample (they are),
- could use different weighting, design-based SEs, or clustering,
- and could be based on standardized variables or not (tests differ slightly depending on procedure).

**Specific star mismatches (examples):**
- Model 3 Education: generated `-0.155*` vs true `-0.151**`
- Model 2 Age: generated `0.109*` vs true `0.140***`
- Model 2 Female: generated p≈0.061 (no star) but true has `-0.083*`
- Model 2 Southern: generated p≈0.061 (no star) but true `0.097**`
- Model 3 Age: generated no star but true `0.110*`
- Model 3 Southern: generated no star but true `0.121**`

**Fix (what you should do to “match” the paper):**
1. **Do not print SEs** if your goal is to reproduce Table 1 exactly—Table 1 doesn’t contain them.
2. **Compute stars using the same inference method as the paper.** In sociology articles using survey data, that often means **survey weights and design-based SEs** (e.g., strata/PSU) or robust SEs. If the paper used GSS survey weights/design correction, plain OLS SEs won’t match.
3. **Only compare significance after you match:**
   - the sample N per model,
   - weighting/design,
   - variable construction.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatches embedded in the generated output

- Your diagnostics note: **“Table shows standardized betas only; stars from raw OLS p-values (SE method may differ from paper).”**
- The “True Results” note says: **standardized coefficients only; SEs not printed.**

**Mismatch:** The generated analysis implicitly treats its own star system as comparable to the paper’s. It isn’t unless the estimation procedure matches.

**Fix:** In your write-up, explicitly state:  
- “Coefficients are standardized to match Table 1. Significance markers are reproduced only after matching the paper’s estimation (weights/design). Otherwise omit stars or label them as ‘from unweighted OLS’.”

---

### 7) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the True Table 1

1. **Rebuild each model’s estimation sample to hit the paper’s N**
   - Target: M1 N=787, M2 N=756, M3 N=503.
   - Use model-specific listwise deletion; don’t let the intolerance construction shrink earlier models.

2. **Recreate the exact intolerance measure**
   - Match item set, coding direction, handling of DK/NA, and the minimum answered-items rule the paper used (your “≥12” is very likely not what they used, or you’re applying it too strictly).

3. **Match coding of categorical variables**
   - Race/ethnicity mutually exclusive categories must match paper.
   - Religion dummy definitions + reference category must match paper.
   - “Southern” definition must match paper.

4. **Match standardization procedure**
   - Standardized coefficients can be computed by:  
     (a) standardizing X and Y then OLS, or  
     (b) converting unstandardized coefficients using SD ratios.  
   These usually agree, but can diverge with missingness/weights. Use the method the authors used (often software default at the time).

5. **Match weighting / survey design (if applicable)**
   - If the paper used GSS weights or complex survey SEs, reproduce them. This affects p-values/stars and sometimes coefficients (if weights used).

6. **Format output to match the paper**
   - Remove SE rows (since Table 1 doesn’t show them).
   - Print standardized betas rounded the same way.
   - Print constants and fit stats matching their rounding.

If you want, paste the paper’s *methods/appendix notes* about weighting and intolerance-scale construction (or a screenshot of that section). That’s usually where the decisive “why N differs” and “why stars differ” information is.
