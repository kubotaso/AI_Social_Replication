Score: 40/100
============================================================

## A. Fit statistics: mismatches and fixes

### 1) Sample sizes (n) are wrong in all models
- **Generated:** Model1 n=747; Model2 n=507; Model3 n=334  
- **True:** Model1 n=787; Model2 n=756; Model3 n=503  

**Likely cause**
- You’re using **listwise deletion on your constructed dataset**, but the paper’s Table 1 uses a **different analytic sample and/or different missing-data handling** (and *definitely* not dropping to 334 by Model 3 if Table 1 reports 503).

**Fix**
- Recreate the paper’s sample restrictions exactly (GSS 1993, correct variable coding, and same inclusion rules).
- Ensure Model 2 and Model 3 are estimated on the paper’s reported N (756, 503). In practice this means:
  - Verify that you’re using the **same missing-value codes** as the original (GSS often uses special codes like 8/9/98/99).
  - Apply the **same “valid response” filters** per variable before modeling.
  - If you intend to reproduce Table 1, you may need to **use the paper’s imputation/availability approach** (even if unmentioned, your N collapse suggests you’re being stricter than the authors).

---

### 2) R² and Adjusted R² are wrong in all models
- **Generated R²:** 0.088; 0.135; 0.137  
- **True R²:** 0.107; 0.151; 0.169  

**Fix**
- Once the **correct analytic sample** and **correct variable coding** are used, these should move closer automatically.
- Also confirm you are running **OLS with the same DV** and that you’re not inadvertently using weights or robust methods that change reported R² (most software still reports the same R² under robust SEs, but weighted models can differ).

---

### 3) “dropped: otherrace” is a clear discrepancy
- **Generated:** Model 2 and 3 show `otherrace` dropped and “Other race” coefficient is NaN.
- **True:** “Other race” is included with nonzero β (0.005 in M2; 0.053 in M3).

**Likely cause**
- Perfect collinearity from how race dummies were created (e.g., including **all** race categories plus an intercept; or constructing `otherrace` incorrectly so it duplicates another dummy).
- Or `otherrace` is all zeros in your reduced sample due to filtering.

**Fix**
- Use **one reference category** for race (e.g., White omitted) and include dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race.
- Verify coding yields variation:
  - `tabotherrace` (frequency) within each model’s analytic sample.
- If your race variables are mutually exclusive indicators, ensure:
  - `white` is not included if you already have intercept + (black, hispanic, otherrace).
  - No dummy is a linear combination of others.

---

## B. Coefficients (β) and interpretation: every mismatch

### Important: Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**, not unstandardized b (except constants)
Your generated output mixes:
- **b** (unstandardized) and **beta** (standardized), and then your “Table1style” outputs **beta** (good).
So comparisons should be made between **generated beta** and **true β**.

## Model 1 mismatches (SES)

**True (β):**
- Education -0.322***
- Income -0.037
- Prestige 0.016
- Constant 10.920
- R² 0.107; Adj 0.104; n 787

**Generated “Table1style” (β):**
- Education **-0.292*** (mismatch: too small in magnitude)
- Income **-0.039** (close; small mismatch vs -0.037)
- Prestige **0.020** (mismatch vs 0.016)
- Constant **10.638** (mismatch vs 10.920)
- R²/AdjR²/n all mismatched (above)

**Fixes**
- Primary: correct **sample** and **coding** (especially DV and education).
- Confirm the DV “number of music genres disliked” is constructed exactly like the paper.
- Confirm education is “years” and not recoded/trimmed differently.

## Model 2 mismatches (Demographic)

**True (β):**
- Education -0.246***
- Income -0.054
- Prestige -0.006
- Female -0.083*
- Age 0.140***
- Black 0.029
- Hispanic -0.029
- Other race 0.005
- Cons Prot 0.059
- No religion -0.012
- Southern 0.097**
- Constant 8.507
- R² 0.151; Adj 0.139; n 756

**Generated “Table1style” (β):**
- Education **-0.264*** (too negative vs -0.246)
- Income **-0.053** (very close to -0.054)
- Prestige **-0.016** (too negative vs -0.006)
- Female **-0.090***? actually “-0.090*” (slightly more negative; star ok)
- Age **0.104***? actually “0.104*” (too small and wrong significance; should be ***)
- Black **0.043** (mismatch vs 0.029)
- Hispanic **0.030** (wrong sign; should be -0.029)
- Other race **missing/blank** (should be 0.005)
- Conservative Protestant **0.090** (too large vs 0.059; and your p≈0.053 suggests not sig, consistent with no star, but the magnitude still off)
- No religion **-0.019** (mismatch vs -0.012)
- Southern **0.063** (too small; should be 0.097** and significant)
- Constant **9.285** (wrong; should be 8.507)

**Fixes**
1) **Race coding**
   - Fix `hispanic` sign error suggests you may have reversed coding (e.g., 1=non-Hispanic, 0=Hispanic).
   - Ensure:
     - Hispanic dummy = 1 if Hispanic, else 0.
     - Black dummy = 1 if Black, else 0.
     - Other race dummy = 1 if neither White/Black/Hispanic, else 0.
     - White is the omitted reference.
2) **Age effect too small / wrong significance**
   - Likely due to sample mismatch (n=507 instead of 756) and/or incorrect age variable (e.g., centered/scaled differently, top-coded handling, or using age category not continuous age).
   - Use continuous age as in GSS (and ensure missing codes removed).
3) **Southern coefficient too small and not significant**
   - Again points to sample/coding mismatch: confirm south is coded like the paper (South vs not South) and isn’t inverted.

## Model 3 mismatches (Political intolerance)

**True (β):**
- Education -0.151**
- Income -0.009
- Prestige -0.022
- Female -0.095*
- Age 0.110*
- Black 0.049
- Hispanic 0.031
- Other race 0.053
- Cons Prot 0.066
- No religion 0.024
- Southern 0.121**
- Political intolerance 0.164***
- Constant 6.516
- R² 0.169; Adj 0.148; n 503

**Generated “Table1style” (β):**
- Education **-0.140***? actually “-0.140*” (mismatch in magnitude and significance; should be **)
- Income **-0.066** (major mismatch; should be -0.009 ~ near zero)
- Prestige **0.009** (wrong sign; should be -0.022)
- Female **-0.124***? actually “-0.124*” (too negative vs -0.095)
- Age **0.072** (too small vs 0.110 and should be significant *)
- Black **0.064** (somewhat higher than 0.049)
- Hispanic **0.014** (too small vs 0.031)
- Other race **missing** (should be 0.053)
- Cons Prot **0.052** (lower than 0.066)
- No religion **0.024** (matches exactly)
- Southern **0.072** (too small vs 0.121**)
- Political intolerance **0.205*** (too large vs 0.164***)
- Constant **6.986** (mismatch vs 6.516)
- R²/AdjR²/n mismatched

**Fixes**
1) **Income and prestige are badly off**
   - This usually indicates one of:
     - income per capita variable constructed differently than the authors (e.g., wrong denominator, wrong transformation, wrong handling of zero/negative, or using raw income categories instead of a continuous per-capita measure).
     - prestige variable not matching `prestg80` coding or scale direction.
   - To match Table 1 you must reproduce their exact operationalizations:
     - How is “household income per capita” computed? (household income / household size? logged? midpoints for categories?)
     - Which prestige scale (e.g., `prestg80`) and how missing handled?
2) **Political intolerance β too large (0.205 vs 0.164)**
   - Likely due to incorrect construction of the intolerance scale (0–15):
     - wrong items included,
     - wrong coding direction,
     - wrong range (e.g., treating “don’t know” as 0),
     - or not requiring complete data across items.
   - Rebuild the intolerance scale exactly as the paper: same items, same scoring, same requirement for valid responses.
3) **Other race still dropped**
   - Fix dummy collinearity as noted above.

---

## C. Standard errors: conceptual mismatch
- **Generated Results** report p-values and (implicitly) standard errors (though SE column isn’t printed, p is).
- **True Results**: Table 1 **does not report SEs** (only stars).

This is not an error per se, but it *is* a mismatch if you claim to reproduce the table exactly.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match Table 1: report **only β with stars** and constants, plus N/R²/AdjR²—omit SE/p columns.
- If you want inferential stats, you must compute them, but you cannot “validate” them against Table 1.

---

## D. Interpretation/star mismatches

Where your stars differ from the paper:
- **Model 2 Age:** Generated shows `*` (p≈0.017) but true is `***`.  
- **Model 2 Southern:** Generated no stars (p≈0.15) but true is `**`.
- **Model 3 Education:** Generated `*` but true is `**`.
- **Model 3 Age:** Generated none (p≈0.188) but true is `*`.

**Fix**
- These will mostly resolve when:
  1) you recover the correct analytic N,
  2) correct coding for key predictors (age, south, intolerance), and
  3) ensure you’re using the same two-tailed p-value thresholds.

---

## E. Concrete “make it match” checklist

1) **Match the analytic sample** (GSS 1993; same exclusions) so N becomes **787 / 756 / 503**.
2) **Rebuild DV** `num_genres_disliked` exactly (same items, same missing rules).
3) **Fix race dummies** so “Other race” is estimable and Hispanic sign matches the paper.
4) **Recompute household income per capita** exactly as the authors did (and confirm it’s not logged unless they logged it).
5) **Use the correct prestige variable** (likely `prestg80`) with correct direction and missing rules.
6) **Reconstruct political intolerance scale (0–15)** with correct items/coding and missingness handling.
7) For the “Table1style” output: print **standardized β** (not b), constants unstandardized, with stars; do not include SEs if you’re claiming an exact Table 1 reproduction.

If you paste your code (especially how you constructed: DV, `inc_pc`, race dummies, and `pol_intol`, plus your NA filtering), I can point to the exact lines causing each discrepancy.
