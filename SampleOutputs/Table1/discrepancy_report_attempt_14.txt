============================================================

Below is a point-by-point reconciliation of **Generated Results** vs the **True Results (Table 1)**. I list **every mismatch** I can see in (a) variable naming/presence, (b) standardized coefficients, (c) (claimed) standard errors, and (d) interpretation/what the table is supposed to represent—plus **how to fix each** so the generated output matches the printed Table 1.

---

## 1) Fundamental reporting mismatch: the generated table includes SE-like rows, but Table 1 has **no SEs**
### What the generated output does
In `table1_style`, each model shows a coefficient line with stars, and then additional numeric lines beneath (e.g., under Model 1: `-0.034`, `0.029`, then later `11.086`, `0.109`, `0.105`, `758`). This looks like the generator tried to print:
- standardized coefficients, then
- standard errors (or other stats), then
- constant / R² / adj R² / N

But the **True Results explicitly state**: Table 1 prints **standardized coefficients only** and **does not print standard errors**.

### Why it’s wrong
Any claim that those second-line numbers are “standard errors” (or any SE display at all) **cannot be validated** against Table 1 and does not match its format.

### How to fix
- Remove standard errors from the “Table 1” reproduction entirely.
- If you want SEs, you must compute them from the data and label them as “computed SEs (not in Table 1)”, but then it will no longer be a reproduction of the printed table.

---

## 2) Sample size mismatches (major; affects coefficients too)
### Mismatches
| Model | Generated N | True N |
|---|---:|---:|
| SES | 758 | 787 |
| Demographic | 522 | 756 |
| Political intolerance | 293 | 503 |

### Why it matters
Different N implies different missing-data handling and/or different variable construction, which will generally change coefficients, R², constants, and p-values.

### How to fix
To match Table 1 you must reproduce the **same estimation sample** used in the paper for each model:
- Use the same year/subsample restrictions (Table indicates a much larger N than your model 2/3).
- Use the same missing-data rule the authors used (likely listwise deletion *within each model* but on the correct underlying dataset and coding).
- Verify your variable coding does not create extra missingness (common culprits: income per capita construction, religion coding, intolerance scale availability).

Practical debugging steps:
1. Recreate exactly the paper’s recodes (especially intolerance scale and religion tradition).
2. Compare counts of missing values for each variable to what the paper implies.
3. Ensure you’re using the same base sample (e.g., if this is GSS, confirm year(s), age restrictions, valid responses only, etc.).

## 3) R² and Adjusted R² mismatches
### Mismatches
| Model | Generated R² / Adj R² | True R² / Adj R² |
|---|---|---|
| SES | 0.10877 / 0.10522 | 0.107 / 0.104 |
| Demographic | 0.15693 / 0.13875 | 0.151 / 0.139 |
| Political intolerance | 0.15154 / 0.11518 | 0.169 / 0.148 |

### Interpretation
- Model 1 is close-ish, consistent with smaller N differences.
- Models 2 and 3 are substantially off, consistent with your N being far too small and/or misconstructed predictors.

### How to fix
Once you fix the **sample sizes** and **variable coding**, R² should move toward the printed values. If it still doesn’t:
- Confirm you are using **standardized coefficients** but R² computed from the **unstandardized OLS on the original variables** (R² is invariant to linear scaling of predictors/outcome, but should match if the sample and variables match).
- Confirm the dependent variable is exactly “number of music genres disliked” with identical coding and range.

---

## 4) Constant (intercept) mismatches
### Mismatches
| Model | Generated constant | True constant |
|---|---:|---:|
| SES | 11.086 | 10.920 |
| Demographic | 10.099 | 8.507 |
| Political intolerance | 7.592 | 6.516 |

### Why it happens
Intercepts are very sensitive to:
- sample composition (your Ns are off),
- whether the outcome is coded the same,
- whether predictors are centered/standardized before estimation,
- whether you are reporting intercept from a model fit on standardized variables (which would be different).

### How to fix
- Fit OLS on the **raw (unstandardized)** variables, then compute standardized betas separately (or use a method that returns standardized betas but keeps the same intercept definition as the paper if that’s what they did).
- Ensure the dependent variable coding matches exactly.
- Fix sample selection/missingness.

---

## 5) Variable name / presence mismatches
### Variable naming
Generated uses: `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`.

These correspond to Table 1 labels, so **names are mostly fine**, but ensure coding matches what the authors mean (especially “Conservative Protestant” and “Other race”).

### Presence in models
The generated models include the right *types* of variables per model, BUT the enormous N loss in models 2 and 3 suggests your construction of some of these (often religion tradition and intolerance scale) is producing excessive missingness or unintended filtering.

### How to fix
- Audit each constructed variable: report frequency tables and missingness.
- Make sure “Hispanic” is coded as in the paper (some papers treat Hispanic as ethnicity overriding race categories; others make mutually exclusive categories).
- Confirm “Conservative Protestant” is created using the same denominational classification scheme as the paper.

## 6) Standardized coefficient mismatches (core of Table 1)
Below are coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches. (All comparisons are standardized betas.)

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.332*** | -0.322*** | too negative by 0.010 |
| Income per capita | -0.034 | -0.037 | small difference |
| Occupational prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | too positive by 0.013 |

**Likely fixes:** minor sample/coding differences. Bringing N from 758 → 787 and matching prestige coding should move these.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.301*** | -0.246*** | **much too negative** |
| Income per capita | -0.057 | -0.054 | close |
| Occupational prestige | -0.007 | -0.006 | close |
| Female | -0.079 (no star) | -0.083* | significance + slightly different magnitude |
| Age | 0.108* | 0.140*** | **too small** + wrong significance |
| Black | 0.026 | 0.029 | close |
| Hispanic | 0.029 | -0.029 | **wrong sign** |
| Other race | -0.016 | 0.005 | wrong sign |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.039 | 0.059 | too small |
| No religion | -0.017 | -0.012 | close-ish |
| Southern | 0.082 (no star) | 0.097** | too small + wrong significance |

**Main red flags here:**
- Your **N is 522 vs 756**. That alone can change many coefficients and significance levels.
- The **Hispanic sign reversal** strongly suggests **different coding** (e.g., you may be using a different reference group construction or mixing race/ethnicity incorrectly).

**How to fix Model 2 specifically**
1. Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies to match the paper’s mutually exclusive categories.
   - If “Hispanic” in the paper is “Hispanic (any race)” vs your “Hispanic race category,” you can easily flip sign/meaning.
2. Ensure “Other race” is coded identically (and reference category matches: usually White non-Hispanic).
3. Fix missingness from religion variables (your diagnostics show `N_conservprot_nonmissing=889`, but model 2 N is 522—so the big drop is not just conservprot; something else in the model 2 variable set is causing listwise deletion, likely income_pc or prestg80 recode or DV availability in that year subset).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157* | -0.151** | close magnitude, wrong significance |
| Income per capita | -0.067 | -0.009 | **much too negative** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.009 | -0.022 | somewhat different |
| Female | -0.119* | -0.095* | too negative |
| Age | 0.091 | 0.110* | too small + wrong significance |
| Black | -0.006 | 0.049 | wrong sign, big difference |
| Hispanic | 0.094 | 0.031 | too positive |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| Conservative Protestant | -0.010 | 0.066 | wrong sign, big difference |
| No religion | 0.017 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.074 | 0.121** | too small + wrong significance |
| Political intolerance | 0.196** | 0.164*** | too large + wrong significance |

**Main red flags:**
- Your **N is 293 vs 503** (very large discrepancy).
- Some signs flip (Black, Conservative Protestant), suggesting coding/reference-category differences and/or a heavily selected subsample.
- Income per capita is wildly off (-0.067 vs -0.009), consistent with either:
  - different income definition (e.g., per-capita computed incorrectly),
  - scaling/standardization issues,
  - or severe selection/missingness producing a different population.

**How to fix Model 3 specifically**
1. Reconstruct the political intolerance scale exactly as the paper did (items, coding direction, handling of DK/NA).
2. Ensure you’re not mistakenly restricting to only those with nonmissing on an overly strict intolerance measure (e.g., requiring complete responses on many items when the authors used a mean of available items or a shorter battery).
3. Recheck the income per capita calculation:
   - confirm household income measure,
   - confirm household size divisor,
   - confirm treatment of top-codes and missing income.
4. Recheck religion tradition coding (Conservative Protestant):
   - wrong classification scheme can flip sign.
5. Fix the sample to reach ~503 cases.

---

## 7) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation errors)
Even when coefficients are near, stars differ because:
- your p-values are computed on a different sample (N mismatch),
- Table 1’s stars come from the authors’ exact model and sample,
- and Table 1 may use slightly different SE assumptions (though likely standard OLS).

Examples:
- Model 2: `female` is starred in True (-0.083*) but not in Generated (p≈0.056).
- Model 2: `age` is *** in True but only * in Generated.
- Model 3: intolerance is *** in True but only ** in Generated.
- Model 3: education is ** in True but * in Generated.

**How to fix**
Once the sample and coding match, recompute p-values and apply the same thresholds. But if you are trying to reproduce Table 1 exactly, do not invent SEs/stars unless you have the same model/sample (and ideally the same software defaults).

---

## 8) “Interpretation” mismatch: what is being claimed vs what Table 1 supports
### Generated output implicitly implies:
- These are standardized coefficients with associated SEs/p-values (because it prints stars from computed p-values).

### True table supports:
- Only standardized coefficients (and stars as printed).
- No SEs in Table 1, so any SE-based interpretation (precision comparisons, CI language) should not be presented as “from Table 1.”

### How to fix
- If reproducing Table 1: report only standardized betas and the stars exactly as printed.
- If doing your own replication: clearly label as “replication using [data]” and accept that it may differ; then explain why (missingness, coding).

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1
1. **Match the estimation samples (N=787, 756, 503)** by replicating the paper’s inclusion/exclusion rules.
2. **Recode race/ethnicity** to match the paper (this likely fixes the Hispanic sign issue and Black coefficient differences).
3. **Recreate Conservative Protestant** using the same denominational classification.
4. **Rebuild political intolerance** exactly (items + missing handling).
5. **Compute standardized coefficients** in the same way the authors did (likely post-estimation standardization or regression on standardized variables, but be consistent with intercept reporting).
6. **Do not print SEs** if claiming to reproduce Table 1.

If you share (a) the code used to build `income_pc`, `political_intolerance`, and the race/religion dummies, and (b) your filtering steps from the raw dataset to each model’s sample, I can pinpoint exactly which step is causing the N collapse and the sign reversals.
