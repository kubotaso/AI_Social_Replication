## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is missing entirely in the generated models**
- **True Table 1:** Includes **Hispanic** in Models 2 and 3 (coeffs: -0.029; 0.031).
- **Generated output:** Explicitly says *“Hispanic omitted”* and there is no `hispanic` term in Model 2 or Model 3.

**How to fix**
- Reconstruct a `hispanic` dummy exactly as the PDF’s coding expects (usually from a race/ethnicity variable, e.g., `hispanic=1` if respondent identifies as Hispanic, regardless of race).
- Then re-estimate Models 2 and 3 including `hispanic` alongside `black` and `other_race` (and with the same omitted reference category as the original table—typically non-Hispanic White).
- If your dataset truly cannot construct Hispanic, then your generated table **cannot** be presented as matching Table 1; you must label it as a replication with altered covariates.

### B. **Sample sizes for Model 1 and Model 3 do not match**
- **True N:** Model 1 = **787**, Model 2 = **756**, Model 3 = **503**
- **Generated N:** Model 1 = **758**, Model 2 = **756** (matches), Model 3 = **426**

This is not a small discrepancy; it will change coefficients and fit statistics.

**How to fix**
- You are using much stricter/mismatched listwise deletion rules than the original.
  - Model 1: you drop 29 more cases than the true table (787 → 758).
  - Model 3: you drop 77 more cases than the true table (503 → 426), driven mainly by your political intolerance construction and/or missingness handling.
- Align to the paper’s missing-data rule:
  - Verify the exact year/subsample used.
  - Verify whether the paper used **pairwise deletion**, **mean imputation**, or a less strict requirement for constructing political intolerance (see section 4).
  - Replicate the original “complete case” definition variable-by-variable.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I compare **standardized coefficients** (your `beta_std` / printed cells) to the true Table 1 values.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | -0.332*** | too negative by -0.010 |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | smaller magnitude (+0.003) |
| Occ prestige | 0.016 | 0.029 | too large by +0.013 |
| Constant | 10.920 | 11.086 | too high (+0.166) |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.107 / 0.104 | 0.109 / 0.105 | slightly high |
| N | 787 | 758 | wrong (drives differences) |

**Likely cause:** wrong estimation sample (listwise deletion not matching Table 1) and possibly different standardization method (see section 3).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.259*** | too negative (-0.013) |
| HH income pc | -0.054 | -0.050 | smaller magnitude (+0.004) |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | 0.006 | **sign flip** |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.089** | larger magnitude and higher sig |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.129*** | smaller by -0.011 |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.030 | matches |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | (omitted) | **missing variable** |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.001 | smaller |
| Cons Prot | 0.059 | 0.067 | larger |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.004 | closer to zero |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.084* | smaller and weaker sig |
| Constant | 8.507 | 8.788 | too high |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.151 / 0.139 | 0.145 / 0.134 | too low |
| N | 756 | 756 | matches |

**Likely causes:**
- **Omitting Hispanic** changes coefficients of other race dummies and other covariates (especially Black/Other race/Southern).
- Possible mismatch in reference categories or coding (e.g., “other_race” definition; whether Hispanic is separated first).
- Standardization differences.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.161** | too negative (-0.010) |
| HH income pc | -0.009 | -0.012 | too negative (-0.003) |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | -0.008 | much closer to 0 (+0.014) |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.114* | too negative (-0.019) |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.060 | **major mismatch; lost significance** |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.062 | somewhat higher |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | (omitted) | **missing variable** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.051 | matches |
| Cons Prot | 0.066 | 0.053 | smaller |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.020 | close |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.087 | smaller and not sig |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.166** | coeff close, **significance lower** |
| Constant | 6.516 | 7.355 | too high |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.169 / 0.148 | 0.139 / 0.117 | much too low |
| N | 503 | 426 | **wrong** |

**Likely causes:**
- Wrong/more restrictive construction of political intolerance scale (and thus much smaller N).
- Omitted Hispanic.
- Different missing-data rules from the original.
- Standardization approach differences.

## 3) “Standard errors” and significance-star interpretation problems

### A. The true table **does not report standard errors**
- **True Results note:** Table 1 prints standardized coefficients only; **no SEs shown**.
- **Generated table:** displays a second line per coefficient that *looks like SEs* (e.g., educ in Model 1: `-0.332***` then `-0.034`).
  - Those numbers are not the true SEs (they cannot be, because SEs aren’t provided).
  - Also, your “SE-looking” values are inconsistent with the `coefficients_long` object (which doesn’t list SEs at all, only b_raw, beta_std, p_raw).

**How to fix**
- Remove the SE rows entirely if your goal is to match Table 1.
- If you want to report SEs anyway, compute and label them clearly (and note they are not in the PDF). Then don’t claim an exact match to the printed table.

### B. Significance stars don’t match the true table in multiple places
Examples:
- Model 2 Female: true `-0.083*`, generated `-0.089**`
- Model 2 Southern: true `0.097**`, generated `0.084*`
- Model 3 Political intolerance: true `0.164***`, generated `0.166**`
- Model 3 Age: true `0.110*`, generated `0.060` (no star)

**How to fix**
- First fix the sample and variable set (Hispanic + N alignment). Stars will change substantially once the model matches.
- Then ensure you are applying the **same two-tailed thresholds** (*, **, ***) as the table.
- Confirm whether the original used conventional OLS SEs, robust SEs, or design-based SEs (survey weights/cluster). Different SE estimators will change stars even if betas are similar.

## 4) Political intolerance scale construction / missingness rule mismatch (major)

Your diagnostics say:

- `political_intolerance nonmissing = 491, missing = 402`
- Model 3 N = 426
- Note: `15/15 items required`

The true table has **N = 503** for Model 3, which is larger than your 491 nonmissing for polintol (and much larger than 426), implying the original authors likely did **not** require “15/15 items” complete to compute the scale (or they used a different set of items / different year / different sample).

**How to fix**
- Recreate political intolerance exactly as the paper did:
  - Same item set (how many items? 15 is your assumption).
  - Same coding and averaging/summing.
  - Same allowance for partial completion (e.g., compute scale if at least k of items answered; or impute missing items).
- Then recompute Model 3 on the same base DV sample to recover N≈503.
- After that, re-run standardization and regression.

## 5) Interpretation mismatches you should correct in the narrative

Even if you didn’t paste your written interpretation, the generated results (as currently estimated) would force different substantive claims than the true table. Key points:

- **Age in Model 3:** True table says age is positive and significant (`0.110*`), but generated says small and not significant (`0.060`). Any narrative claiming age matters in Model 3 would be wrong under your generated model; any narrative claiming it *doesn’t* matter would be wrong relative to the true table.
- **Political intolerance significance:** True is `***`; generated is `**`. Don’t claim p<.001 if your current p-value is ~0.00147.
- **Occupational prestige signs:** In Model 2 true is slightly negative (-0.006), generated is slightly positive (+0.006). Don’t interpret prestige as increasing disliked genres if trying to match Table 1.

**How to fix**
- Don’t adjust interpretation to fit; adjust the *model/data processing* to match the table (Hispanic + N + polintol construction + standardization + SE method). Then interpret.

## 6) Checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Add Hispanic** (and ensure race/ethnicity coding matches the table’s mutually exclusive categories and reference group).
2. **Match samples (N):**
   - Model 1 must return **787**
   - Model 2 must return **756**
   - Model 3 must return **503**
3. **Rebuild political intolerance** using the same rule as the paper (do not require 15/15 unless the paper explicitly did).
4. **Standardize variables the same way** as the authors (typically z-scores using the estimation sample for each model).
5. **Match inference method** (OLS vs robust vs survey-weight/design-based). This is essential for stars.
6. **Table formatting:** remove SE rows if replicating the PDF table, because the true table prints no SEs.

If you share the code used to (a) construct `political_intolerance`, (b) code race/ethnicity, and (c) standardize coefficients, I can point to the exact lines that are causing the N and coefficient/significance divergences.
