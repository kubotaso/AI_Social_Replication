## 1) Fit statistics / sample sizes: mismatches

### **N (number of cases)**
- **Model 1:** Generated **747** vs True **787** (−40)
- **Model 2:** Generated **507** vs True **756** (−249)
- **Model 3:** Generated **286** vs True **503** (−217)

**How to fix**
- Your estimation frames show very high missingness on `hispanic` (35%) and `pol_intol` (47%). That is driving N down, especially in Models 2–3.
- To match the paper’s N, you need to reproduce *their* missing-data rules and variable construction. Concretely:
  1. **Recode GSS special missing values to NA correctly** (e.g., DK/NA/Refused codes like 8, 9, 98, 99, etc., vary by variable).
  2. **Construct race/ethnicity variables exactly as the paper did.** Your `hispanic` appears to have far more missingness than the paper’s workflow would imply (since their N in Model 2 is only slightly below Model 1).
  3. **Do not listwise-delete on a variable that the paper did not include or coded differently.** Verify `hispanic` and `pol_intol` are not inadvertently set to missing for large groups due to a coding bug (common: treating “not asked” as missing when it should be a valid 0 category, or vice versa).

### **R² and Adjusted R²**
- **Model 1:** Generated R² **0.088** vs True **0.107**; Adj R² **0.085** vs **0.104**
- **Model 2:** Generated R² **0.137** vs **0.151**; Adj R² **0.118** vs **0.139**
- **Model 3:** Generated R² **0.148** vs **0.169**; Adj R² **0.111** vs **0.148**

**How to fix**
- These will not align until **N aligns** and the **same covariate coding/standardization** is used.
- Also confirm you are using **OLS with the same weighting** as the paper (many GSS analyses use weights; unweighted vs weighted can move R² and β).

---

## 2) Coefficients: standardized β mismatches (Table 1 is β)

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constants**. Your “Table1style” uses the `beta` column (good), but many β’s don’t match.

### Model 1 (SES) β mismatches
- **Education:** Generated **−0.292*** vs True **−0.322*** (too small in magnitude)
- **Income:** Generated **−0.039** vs True **−0.037** (close)
- **Prestige:** Generated **0.020** vs True **0.016** (close)
- **Constant:** Generated **10.638** vs True **10.920** (too low)

**How to fix**
- Main issue is likely **sample mismatch and/or different standardization base** (you standardize on your analytic subset; if their subset differs, β differs).
- Recompute standardized betas using the **same sample** and same variable definitions as the paper. If they standardized using the model estimation sample, match that.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic) β mismatches
- **Education:** Gen **−0.266*** vs True **−0.246*** (too negative)
- **Income:** Gen **−0.052** vs True **−0.054** (close)
- **Prestige:** Gen **−0.011** vs True **−0.006** (too negative)
- **Female:** Gen **−0.088***? (your star is *) vs True **−0.083***? (True is *) → magnitude slightly off
- **Age:** Gen **0.103***? (your star is *) vs True **0.140*** → **big mismatch**
- **Black:** Gen **0.072** vs True **0.029** (too large)
- **Hispanic:** Gen **0.042** vs True **−0.029** (**sign flips**)
- **Other race:** Gen **−0.000** vs True **0.005** (diff, small)
- **Cons Prot:** Gen **0.083** vs True **0.059** (too large)
- **No religion:** Gen **−0.017** vs True **−0.012** (close)
- **Southern:** Gen **0.061** vs True **0.097** (too small)
- **Constant:** Gen **9.263** vs True **8.507** (too high)

**How to fix**
1. **Hispanic sign flip** strongly suggests your `hispanic` coding does not match theirs (e.g., reference group differs, Hispanic overlaps with race dummies, or miscoding 1/0).
   - Ensure mutually exclusive categories if they used them, or ensure the same “race + Hispanic ethnicity” scheme.
   - Check whether the paper used **race categories including Hispanic as race** vs **Hispanic as ethnicity**. Your model includes both `black`, `otherrace`, and `hispanic`—this can be fine, but only if coded correctly and with the same omitted category (likely White non-Hispanic).
2. **Age β mismatch (0.103 vs 0.140)** suggests:
   - Age was possibly transformed in the paper (e.g., age in decades, centered, or with top-coding handled differently), or
   - Your reduced N (507) is distorting estimates.
3. **Southern β mismatch (0.061 vs 0.097)** similarly points to different sample/coding (or weights).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance) β mismatches
- **Education:** Gen **−0.157***? (your star *) vs True **−0.151**** (True is **): close-ish, stars differ
- **Income:** Gen **−0.049** vs True **−0.009** (**large mismatch**)
- **Prestige:** Gen **−0.016** vs True **−0.022** (moderate)
- **Female:** Gen **−0.126***? (star *) vs True **−0.095*** (too negative)
- **Age:** Gen **0.091 (ns)** vs True **0.110*** (should be significant and larger)
- **Black:** Gen **0.113** vs True **0.049** (too large)
- **Hispanic:** Gen **0.034** vs True **0.031** (close)
- **Other race:** Gen **0.074** vs True **0.053** (somewhat large)
- **Cons Prot:** Gen **0.038** vs True **0.066** (too small)
- **No religion:** Gen **0.024** vs True **0.024** (matches)
- **Southern:** Gen **0.068** vs True **0.121** (**too small**)
- **Political intolerance:** Gen **0.182**** vs True **0.164*** (too large; stars differ)
- **Constant:** Gen **7.314** vs True **6.516** (too high)

**How to fix**
- The **income β** discrepancy is especially diagnostic: you have income as a meaningful negative predictor in Model 3 (β≈−.05) while the paper shows it near zero (β≈−.009). That usually happens when:
  1. Income is **scaled differently** (per-capita calculation differs; log vs linear; trimming/winsorization differs), and/or
  2. Your **sample composition** is very different due to missingness (your N=286 vs 503), and/or
  3. **Weights** differ.
- Political intolerance β being larger (0.182 vs 0.164) is also consistent with a different estimation sample and/or different intolerance scale construction (0–15 must be replicated exactly, including how “don’t know” items are handled).

---

## 3) Standard errors: you cannot “match” them to Table 1 (but you must not imply you did)

### What’s wrong in the generated output
- Your generated tables show **p-values and significance stars derived from SEs**, but the “True Results” explicitly say **SEs are not reported in Table 1**.
- That means you cannot claim a mismatch in SEs relative to Table 1—there is no SE target to compare against.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to match the paper’s Table 1:
  - **Do not report SEs/p-values as if you are validating against Table 1.**
  - Report **β and stars** only, or compute stars from your model but clearly label them as **computed**, not “as reported.”
- If the goal is replication beyond Table 1:
  - You need the paper’s underlying model output (or appendix) for SE comparison; otherwise treat SEs as “not comparable.”

---

## 4) Interpretation / reporting mismatches

### Stars/significance levels
There are several places where your stars don’t match the paper’s (e.g., Model 3 political intolerance is ** in yours but *** in true; age in Model 2 is only * in yours but *** in true).

**How to fix**
- Once you match **N, coding, weights, and standardization**, the p-values should move closer.
- Also verify you’re using the same **two-tailed tests** and that your star cutoffs match (*<.05, **<.01, ***<.001). Your output appears to use that, but the underlying p’s differ because the model differs.

## 5) Variable-name / construction discrepancies to audit explicitly

Even if names “match,” the *construction* likely doesn’t. Based on the mismatches and missingness, audit these first:

1. **`hispanic`**
   - Why 35% missing? In many GSS waves, Hispanic origin is asked broadly; 35% missing suggests you treated “inapplicable/not asked” incorrectly.
   - Fix by matching the exact GSS coding for 1993 and the paper’s inclusion rule (often recode “not Hispanic” as 0, Hispanic as 1, and exclude only true missing).

2. **`pol_intol` (0–15)**
   - Your missingness is 47%, collapsing Model 3 N to 286.
   - Fix by reconstructing the scale exactly (which items, how summed, how missing handled—listwise across items vs mean-imputation vs requiring a minimum number of answered items).

3. **`inc_pc`**
   - Ensure it is the same “household income per capita” definition (household income / household size), same income measure (real dollars vs categories converted), same handling of top-codes and missing.

4. **Weights**
   - If the paper used GSS weights (common), you must apply them consistently in all models; otherwise β and R² won’t align.

---

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Recreate the exact analytic sample**
   - Start from GSS 1993 respondents.
   - Apply the paper’s exclusions (age limits? nonresponse filters?).
   - Ensure Models 1–3 use the same case base except for variables newly introduced (Model 2 drops from 787→756 in the paper; Model 3 drops to 503—not the huge drops you have).

2. **Recode missing values properly**
   - For every variable: map GSS special codes to NA correctly.
   - Avoid coding “not asked” as NA if the paper treated it as 0/false for indicators (especially relevant to `hispanic` and religious tradition flags).

3. **Rebuild composite variables**
   - Reconstruct `pol_intol` exactly per the paper; confirm range 0–15 and the distribution.
   - Rebuild `num_genres_disliked` exactly (which genres, what counts as “disliked,” how “don’t know” handled).

4. **Apply the same weighting and estimation choices**
   - OLS, same weights, same treatment of strata/PSU if they used survey regression (if they did, SEs/stars will differ even with same coefficients).

5. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way**
   - Since Table 1 reports standardized β, compute β using the same sample and method (typically: standardize X and Y within the model sample; intercept remains unstandardized).

6. **Regenerate Table 1 output**
   - Output β’s and constants exactly; suppress SEs (or label them as “computed, not in paper”).
   - Verify against each target β, R², adj R², and N.

If you share the codebook/recodes you used for `hispanic`, `pol_intol`, and `inc_pc` (or screenshots of their frequency tables), I can pinpoint the exact coding error causing the sign flip and the massive N drop.
