### 1) Fit statistics / sample sizes: mismatches and fixes

**Mismatch: `n` and model sample sizes don’t match the true table.**
- **Generated:** Model1 n=747; Model2 n=507; Model3 n=286  
- **True:** Model1 n=787; Model2 n=756; Model3 n=503

**What this implies:** your generated regressions were run on *much smaller* analytic samples (especially Models 2–3), almost certainly due to listwise deletion with additional missingness or mis-specified variable construction/coding.

**How to fix**
- Ensure each model uses the **same inclusion rules as the paper**. The paper’s N *increases/decreases differently* than your output: it goes **787 → 756 → 503**, not 747 → 507 → 286.
- Check that your variables match the paper’s exactly (especially **political intolerance** and race/ethnicity coding) and that you:
  - restrict to **GSS 1993**
  - use the same valid ranges / recodes (e.g., set GSS “DK/NA/Refused/Not asked” to missing)
  - apply **the same listwise deletion per model** (only drop cases missing on variables in that model, not on variables from other models)
- If you constructed `pol_intol (0–15)` from multiple items, confirm you’re not accidentally requiring all component items when the paper used fewer, or used an index with different missing-data handling.

**Mismatch: R² and adjusted R² differ in all models.**
- **Model 1:** Generated R²=0.088 vs True R²=0.107; Adj R²=0.0846 vs 0.104  
- **Model 2:** 0.138 vs 0.151; Adj 0.1188 vs 0.139  
- **Model 3:** 0.148 vs 0.169; Adj 0.1109 vs 0.148  

**Likely causes**
1) Different sample (already evident from N).  
2) Different coefficient type: the true table reports **standardized coefficients (β)**, while your output looks like **unstandardized OLS b** (see section 3). R² itself doesn’t change from standardizing *X and Y* in the same sample, but differences in **sample** and **coding** will.

**How to fix**
- First fix the **sample/coding** so N matches; then recompute R².
- Confirm you are modeling the same **dependent variable** and that it’s coded identically to “Number of music genres disliked”.

### 2) Variable names: mismatches and fixes

**Mismatch: variable labels vs variable identities**
- **Generated term names** are presentation labels (“Education (years)”, “Political intolerance (0–15)”).
- **True table variable names** are generic (“Education”, “Political intolerance”).

That’s not inherently wrong, but it becomes a problem if the label implies a different construct than the paper used.

**Specific red flags**
- **Education:** Paper uses “Education” (likely years). Your label “Education (years)” is plausible, but verify the paper didn’t use categories or a different transformation.
- **Political intolerance:** Your label “(0–15)” implies a 0–15 additive scale. The paper’s “Political intolerance” may be a different scale, or the same but you must verify the construction and missingness rules. Your missingness table shows **47% missing** on `pol_intol`, which is high and consistent with your Model 3 N collapse to 286—this is a major sign your index construction differs from the paper’s.

**How to fix**
- Document and replicate the paper’s **exact operationalization**:
  - which items form political intolerance
  - how items were coded (direction, scaling)
  - how missing items were handled (e.g., require all items? allow partial?)
- Align race/ethnicity and religion coding to the paper (mutually exclusive categories, reference group, etc.).

### 3) Coefficients: every numeric mismatch (by model) and what it indicates

A key overarching discrepancy:

**Critical mismatch: true coefficients are standardized (β), your generated ones appear unstandardized (b).**
- Example: True Model 1 constant = 10.920 and β(education) = -0.322.  
- Your Model 1 constant = 10.638 and “education” = -0.292.  
If these were unstandardized b’s, we wouldn’t expect them to resemble standardized β’s at all. The fact that they’re “close-ish” but not matching is consistent with **wrong sample + wrong standardization + possibly wrong coding**.

**How to fix (core requirement)**
- To match Table 1, you must output **standardized coefficients** for predictors:
  - Either standardize variables before OLS (`z = (x-mean)/sd`) and run OLS on standardized X and standardized Y (or use a function that reports standardized betas).
  - Keep the **constant unstandardized** (the paper’s note says constants are unstandardized).
- Then apply the same significance thresholds and stars.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | wrong |
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | wrong magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | slightly off |
| Occ prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | off |

**Fix**
- Primary: get **N=787** and compute **standardized β**.
- Secondary: confirm income and prestige scales match paper.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Constant | 9.639 | 8.507 | wrong (large) |
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | wrong |
| Income pc | -0.053 | -0.054 | close |
| Occ prestige | -0.009 | -0.006 | off |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close |
| Age | 0.104* | 0.140*** | **wrong size + wrong significance** |
| Black | 0.036 | 0.029 | off |
| Hispanic | -0.027 | -0.029 | close |
| Other race | -0.023 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.080 | 0.059 | off |
| No religion | -0.017 | -0.012 | off |
| Southern | 0.061 | 0.097** | **wrong size + wrong significance** |

**Fix**
- **Age**: your effect is smaller and only `*`, while true is larger and `***`. This is typical of (a) different sample, (b) age coding differences (e.g., top-coding, missing handling), or (c) standardization mismatch. Fix sample and standardization first.
- **Other race sign flip**: suggests your “Other race” dummy is not defined the same way (or reference group differs). Ensure:
  - categories are mutually exclusive
  - reference category is the same as the paper (likely “White” as omitted)
  - “Other race” excludes Black and Hispanic exactly as in the paper.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Constant | 7.637 | 6.516 | wrong |
| Education | -0.157* | -0.151** | wrong significance (and slightly off) |
| Income pc | -0.050 | -0.009 | **very wrong magnitude** |
| Occ prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | off |
| Female | -0.126* | -0.095* | wrong magnitude |
| Age | 0.091 | 0.110* | wrong (lost significance) |
| Black | 0.085 | 0.049 | off |
| Hispanic | 0.002 | 0.031 | off |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.038 | 0.066 | off |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.024 | matches |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.121** | wrong size + significance |
| Political intolerance | 0.183** | 0.164*** | wrong size + significance |

**Fix**
- The **income per capita** discrepancy (-0.050 vs -0.009) is too large to be noise; it signals you likely:
  - used a different income transformation (raw vs logged vs scaled)
  - standardized differently
  - or (most likely) changed the sample dramatically (your N=286 vs 503).
- **Political intolerance significance:** your `**` vs true `***`—again consistent with smaller N and/or different measure construction.
- Fix the political intolerance scale construction and missing handling so Model 3 N becomes **503**.

### 4) Standard errors: mismatches and fixes

**Mismatch: you present no standard errors, while the prompt asks to compare SEs.**
- **Generated:** no SEs shown (only coefficients and stars)
- **True:** SEs are explicitly **not reported** (—)

So there’s no numeric SE mismatch to enumerate, but there *is* a reporting mismatch in expectation: your generated analysis should explicitly state **SEs are not available in the source table** and therefore cannot be compared.

**How to fix**
- In your generated results, add a note like: “Table reports standardized coefficients with significance stars; standard errors not provided; we therefore do not report/compare SEs.”
- If you are reproducing from raw data, you *can* compute SEs, but then you are no longer “matching Table 1 exactly.” You should separate:
  - “Replication of Table 1 (β and stars)”
  - “Our re-estimated model from microdata (b/β, SEs, p-values)”

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches (implied by stars)

Because stars differ on several predictors (Age, Southern, Education in Model 3, Political intolerance), your substantive interpretation would diverge:

- **Age (Model 2):** true interpretation: strong positive association (***). Generated would incorrectly say only weak evidence (*).
- **Southern (Models 2–3):** true: positive and significant (**). Generated: smaller and not significant (no stars in Model 3; only none/weak in Model 2).
- **Political intolerance (Model 3):** true: positive and highly significant (***). Generated: weaker significance (**).

**How to fix**
- Once coefficients and Ns match, apply the **same star cutoffs** stated (two-tailed: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001).
- Ensure you’re using two-tailed p-values and the same model type (OLS).

---

### 6) Biggest underlying causes to address (priority order)

1) **Use standardized coefficients (β) for predictors** (Table 1 standardization requirement).  
2) **Match analytic sample sizes (N)** per model by replicating the paper’s missing-data rules and variable construction—especially `pol_intol`.  
3) **Match dummy coding/reference categories** (notably “Other race”).  
4) **Match transformations/scales** (income per capita is especially suspect in Model 3).  
5) Only then: re-check R²/Adj R² and significance stars.

If you share the code (or at least how each variable was constructed and how missingness was handled), I can pinpoint exactly which step is causing the N collapse and the “Other race” sign flip.
