## 1) Table format / interpretation mismatches

### A. **Standard errors are shown in the generated table, but the “true” Table 1 has none**
- **Generated:** shows a second line per coefficient that appears to be **standard errors** (e.g., educ has “-0.332***” then “-0.034” beneath it).
- **True:** explicitly says **Table 1 reports standardized coefficients only and does not print standard errors**.

**Fix**
- Remove standard-error rows entirely from `table1_style`, or replace them with blanks/“—”.
- If you want SEs, you must compute them from the underlying data and clearly label them as *computed (not from Table 1)* rather than claiming they match the printed table.

### B. **Your significance stars don’t match the PDF table’s stars**
Even when the coefficient is close, stars often differ because your p-values differ from the printed results (likely due to different sample, coding, or model specification).

**Fix**
- First match the **sample and coding** (see sections below). Only then recompute p-values/stars.
- Also ensure the same star cutoffs as the PDF: *p*<.05/*p*<.01/*p*<.001.

## 2) Sample size and fit-stat mismatches (these are major)

### N (cases)
| Model | Generated N | True N | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| SES | 758 | 787 | -29 |
| Demographic | 523 | 756 | -233 |
| Political intolerance | 343 | 503 | -160 |

These are not small discrepancies; they guarantee different coefficients/p-values.

**Likely causes (based on your missingness tables)**
- **Hispanic missingness:** you have **281 missing** for `hispanic`, collapsing Model 2 to **523**. In most survey datasets, “Hispanic” is often derivable from ethnicity items; it usually shouldn’t be missing for hundreds if coded properly.
- **Political intolerance missingness:** you have **312 missing** on `political_intolerance`, collapsing Model 3 to **343**.

**Fix**
1. Reproduce the PDF’s **exact inclusion rules**:
   - Use the same survey year/filter (your diagnostics mention `N_year_1993=1606`, but your working N is 893—there’s already an unaccounted restriction: `N_complete_music_18=893`).
2. Recode “Hispanic” and race variables to match the paper (common fixes):
   - If Hispanic is an ethnicity measure, code it from the original ethnicity variable, not from a partially missing derived dummy.
   - Ensure race dummies are mutually exclusive and that “Hispanic” is treated the same way as in the article (some papers treat Hispanic as separate from race; others fold Hispanics into race categories).
3. Reconstruct `political_intolerance` **exactly as the paper did**:
   - Your own diagnostic says `political_intolerance_min_answered=12` and `tol_items_answered_min=0`, implying the index may require a minimum number of answered items. If the paper included more people by using fewer required items, mean-imputation, or prorating, your listwise deletion will drop too many.
   - If the paper created a scale using available items (e.g., average of answered items with a threshold), do that rather than requiring complete cases.

### R² / Adjusted R²
| Model | Generated R² | True R² | Generated Adj R² | True Adj R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SES | 0.1088 | 0.107 | 0.1052 | 0.104 |
| Demographic | 0.1572 | 0.151 | 0.1391 | 0.139 |
| Political intolerance | 0.1503 | 0.169 | 0.1194 | 0.148 |

Model 3 fit is especially off (both R² and Adj R² much lower), consistent with your smaller N and/or different intolerance scale.

**Fix**
- Matching N/coding will largely fix R²; if still off, check whether the paper used **weights** (common in GSS-type analyses), which affects R² and SEs/stars.

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I compare your **generated `beta_std`** to the **true standardized coefficients**.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated | True | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.332*** | -0.322*** | Close but not exact |
| Income pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | Close |
| Prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | Noticeable difference |
| Constant | 11.086 | 10.920 | Off |

**Fix**
- The constant difference and prestige gap point to different sample/standardization procedure. Ensure you compute standardized coefficients the same way as the paper (typically: run OLS on raw variables and report standardized betas, or run OLS on z-scored variables—these differ only if there are weights or missing handling differences).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated | True | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.302*** | -0.246*** | Large mismatch |
| Income pc | -0.057 | -0.054 | Close |
| Prestige | -0.007 | -0.006 | Close |
| Female | -0.078 | -0.083* | Similar magnitude; star differs |
| Age | 0.109* | 0.140*** | Large mismatch + stars |
| Black | 0.053 | 0.029 | Moderate mismatch |
| Hispanic | -0.017 | -0.029 | Mismatch |
| Other race | -0.016 | 0.005 | Sign mismatch |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.040 | 0.059 | Mismatch |
| No religion | -0.016 | -0.012 | Close |
| Southern | 0.079 | 0.097** | Mismatch + stars |
| Constant | 10.089 | 8.507 | Very large mismatch |

**Fix**
- This pattern (many shifts; some sign changes; big constant shift) is exactly what you’d expect from:
  1) **Wrong estimation sample** (your N is 523 vs 756), and/or  
  2) **Different dummy coding / reference categories** (especially `other_race`, `southern`, religion, race/ethnicity construction), and/or  
  3) Weights.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated | True | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | Similar size; stars differ |
| Income pc | -0.075 | -0.009 | Huge mismatch |
| Prestige | 0.015 | -0.022 | Sign mismatch |
| Female | -0.117* | -0.095* | Mismatch |
| Age | 0.080 | 0.110* | Mismatch + stars |
| Black | 0.065 | 0.049 | Mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.018 | 0.031 | Mismatch |
| Other race | 0.034 | 0.053 | Mismatch |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.002 | 0.066 | Huge mismatch |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | Close |
| Southern | 0.079 | 0.121** | Large mismatch + stars |
| Political intolerance | 0.211*** | 0.164*** | Large mismatch |
| Constant | 7.237 | 6.516 | Mismatch |

**Fix**
- Model 3 is strongly inconsistent: your intolerance effect is much larger, income flips from near-zero to sizable negative, prestige changes sign. The most likely causes:
  - **Your `political_intolerance` scale is not the same** (range/standardization/required items).
  - **Listwise deletion is extreme** (343 vs 503), changing composition.
  - **Religion and region dummies** may be coded differently than the paper (your conservative Protestant effect ~0, while true is 0.066).

## 4) Variable name / definition mismatches

### A. Variable names do not match the Table 1 labels
- **Generated terms:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`
- **True table labels:** “Education”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, etc.

This is mostly cosmetic, but it becomes a substantive mismatch if (as appears likely) your constructed variables do not operationalize the same concepts.

**Fix**
- In the output table, map internal names to printed labels.
- More importantly: verify each constructed variable equals the paper’s definition (especially `income_pc`, `hispanic`, `conservative_protestant`, `political_intolerance`).

### B. `income_pc` scaling/definition is uncertain
Your raw coefficient `b_raw` for income is ~`-0.000014` etc., which implies currency units and scaling choices affect results.

**Fix**
- Confirm paper’s “household income per capita” construction:
  - per-capita = household income / household size? equivalized?
  - top-coding/transform (log?)? inflation adjustment?
- Once the raw variable matches, standardized beta should match more closely.

## 5) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the “true” Table 1

1. **Use the same analytic sample sizes as the table**
   - Recreate the PDF’s sample restrictions (age range, year, nonmissing DV, etc.) so that N becomes **787 / 756 / 503**.
   - Do not use overly strict complete-case rules for indices if the paper didn’t.

2. **Rebuild `political_intolerance` exactly**
   - Use the same items, coding direction, and aggregation rule (sum/mean; prorated; minimum items answered).
   - Then standardize the predictor the same way the paper did before reporting standardized betas.

3. **Fix `hispanic` and race coding**
   - Eliminate the huge missingness (281) by deriving Hispanic from the correct source variable.
   - Ensure the same reference category as the paper (usually White, non-Hispanic; and omit one category).

4. **Verify religion dummy construction**
   - `conservative_protestant` and `no_religion` should match the author’s denominational classification scheme.
   - A near-zero effect in your Model 3 versus 0.066 in the table suggests misclassification.

5. **Check weighting**
   - If the paper used survey weights, replicate them. Differences in stars and some coefficients often persist until weights are matched.

6. **Output formatting**
   - Report **standardized coefficients only**, no SEs, to match the PDF Table 1.
   - Match the constant and fit stats after the above; otherwise the table is not comparable.

---

If you share the code used to construct `income_pc`, `hispanic`, `conservative_protestant`, and especially `political_intolerance` (items + scoring + missing rules), I can pinpoint exactly which construction step is producing each coefficient/sign mismatch (e.g., why income is -0.075 in Model 3 instead of -0.009, and why “other race” flips sign in Model 2).
