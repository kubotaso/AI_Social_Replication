Score: 18/100
============================================================

## 1) Model/sample fit statistics: mismatches

### N (sample sizes)
- **Generated**: Model 1 **747**, Model 2 **507**, Model 3 **286**
- **True**: Model 1 **787**, Model 2 **756**, Model 3 **503**
- **Fix**: Your generated models are being estimated on a much smaller “complete-case” subset—especially Models 2–3. To match the paper, you must replicate the paper’s **missing-data handling** and **sample restrictions** (and the exact GSS 1993 extract/weights).
  - Concretely: verify you are using **GSS 1993 only**, the same inclusion criteria, and the same recodes.
  - Then check whether the paper used **listwise deletion** *but on a different set of constructed variables* (e.g., different income variable, different Hispanic coding, different political intolerance measure), or used **pairwise deletion/imputation**. Your missingness diagnostics show huge loss from `hispanic` and `pol_intol`; that is likely not how the paper constructed them.

### R² and Adjusted R²
- **Generated**: R² = **0.088**, **0.139**, **0.149**
- **True**: R² = **0.107**, **0.151**, **0.169**
- **Fix**: Once N and variable construction match, R² should move closer. Right now the R² mismatch is consistent with:
  - different samples (major driver),
  - different operationalization/coding of predictors (especially `pol_intol`, `hispanic`, and region),
  - possibly different use of weights (weighted vs unweighted OLS changes R²).

## 2) Variable naming/definition mismatches

### Dependent variable name/definition
- **Generated DV**: `num_genres_disliked` (labeled “Number of Music Genres Disliked”)
- **True DV**: “Number of Music Genres Disliked”
- **Potential mismatch**: the label matches, but you must ensure the **same construction** (same set of genres and coding of “disliked” vs “neutral/like/NA”).
- **Fix**: Rebuild the DV exactly from the same GSS items used in the paper; verify range and distribution match the paper (mean/SD).

### Political intolerance variable
- **Generated**: `Political intolerance (0–15)` (`pol_intol`)
- **True**: “Political intolerance” (β reported)
- **Likely mismatch**: your `pol_intol` appears to have **massive missingness (47%)** and shrinks N to 286, while the true model has N=503. That strongly implies your intolerance scale is not constructed like the paper’s (wrong component items, too strict NA rules, or wrong year/variables).
- **Fix**: Identify the exact intolerance items (often 3–5 civil-liberties questions) and replicate the paper’s scale construction:
  - same items,
  - same directionality,
  - same scoring range,
  - same missing rule (e.g., allow ≤1 missing item and average; don’t require complete on all items if the paper didn’t).

### Hispanic / race dummies
- **Generated**: `Hispanic` variable causes huge missingness (35% overall; 33% conditional on DV), collapsing Model 2 N to 507.
- **True**: Model 2 N=756, so the paper’s Hispanic indicator clearly did **not** wipe out 1/3 of cases.
- **Fix**:
  - In GSS, “HISPANIC” is often a separate ethnicity variable with skip patterns. The paper may have coded Hispanic using a different source variable or recoded missing/“don’t know” differently.
  - Ensure race/ethnicity dummies are created so that **missing ethnicity doesn’t become missing for the whole model** unless the paper did that. Common fix: create mutually exclusive categories with a clear baseline and treat “not ascertained” consistently (either drop a small number or code as non-Hispanic if appropriate per codebook—depends on the paper).

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model

### Model 1 (SES)

**Education**
- Generated β: **-0.292***  
- True β: **-0.322***  
- Fix: sample/weights/coding. The sign and significance match, magnitude is off.

**Household income per capita**
- Generated β: **-0.039**  
- True β: **-0.037**  
- Fix: very close; will likely align once N/weights match.

**Occupational prestige**
- Generated β: **0.020**  
- True β: **0.016**  
- Fix: close.

**Constant**
- Generated: **10.638**
- True: **10.920**
- Fix: constants are unstandardized and highly sensitive to sample composition and coding/centering. This should move with corrected sample/variable construction.

**R²/Adj R²/N**
- Already mismatched (see above).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

**Education**
- Generated β: **-0.265***  
- True β: **-0.246***  
- Fix: sample/weights/coding.

**Income**
- Generated β: **-0.051**  
- True β: **-0.054**  
- Fix: close.

**Occupational prestige**
- Generated β: **-0.011**  
- True β: **-0.006**  
- Fix: close.

**Female**
- Generated β: **-0.085*** (star shown as `*` in table1style)  
- True β: **-0.083*** (one star)  
- Fix: close; star level in your output is consistent.

**Age**
- Generated β: **0.103*** with only `*` significance (p≈0.019)  
- True β: **0.140*** (***)
- This is a **major mismatch** in both magnitude and significance.
- Fix: very likely due to **different sample** (your Model 2 N=507 vs 756), and/or **age coding** (you use `age_v`; confirm it matches the paper’s age variable and restrictions), and/or weighting.

**Black**
- Generated β: **0.100**  
- True β: **0.029**
- Big mismatch.
- Fix: race coding/baseline mismatch is likely. Check if your “Other race” and “Hispanic” dummies overlap with Black, or if the paper’s Black is restricted to non-Hispanic Black, etc.

**Hispanic**
- Generated β: **0.074**  
- True β: **-0.029**
- Sign flips → strong evidence your Hispanic variable is not comparable (definition or baseline category differs).
- Fix: rebuild race/ethnicity categories exactly (often: White non-Hispanic baseline; indicators for Black, Hispanic, Other). Ensure mutual exclusivity.

**Other race**
- Generated β: **-0.027**  
- True β: **0.005**
- Fix: same race/ethnicity recode issue.

**Conservative Protestant**
- Generated β: **0.087** (p≈0.059; no star in your table1style)  
- True β: **0.059** (no star)
- Fix: modest mismatch; likely sample/coding.

**No religion**
- Generated β: **-0.015**  
- True β: **-0.012**
- Fix: close.

**Southern**
- Generated β: **0.061** (ns)  
- True β: **0.097**** (**)**
- Meaningful mismatch in both magnitude and significance.
- Fix: region coding (your `south` dummy may not replicate “South” definition) and sample/weights.

**Constant**
- Generated: **8.675**
- True: **8.507**
- Fix: sample/coding.

**R²/Adj R²/N**
- Generated: 0.139 / 0.120 / 507
- True: 0.151 / 0.139 / 756
- Fix: missingness/weights/variable construction.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

**Education**
- Generated β: **-0.155*** with `*` (p≈0.028)  
- True β: **-0.151**** (**)
- Magnitude matches well; significance differs slightly.
- Fix: sample size (you have 286 vs 503) affects SE/p.

**Income**
- Generated β: **-0.052**
- True β: **-0.009**
- Very large mismatch.
- Fix: almost certainly your “income per capita” differs from the paper’s (different scaling, transformation, top-coding handling, or per-capita construction). If your income variable is computed by dividing household income by household size, confirm the paper did the same. Many papers instead use logged income, income categories, or unadjusted family income.

**Occupational prestige**
- Generated β: **-0.015**
- True β: **-0.022**
- Close-ish.

**Female**
- Generated β: **-0.127*** (p≈0.028)  
- True β: **-0.095*** (one star)
- Fix: sample/weights.

**Age**
- Generated β: **0.091** (ns)  
- True β: **0.110*** (one star)
- Fix: sample/weights/age coding.

**Black**
- Generated β: **0.060**
- True β: **0.049**
- Close.

**Hispanic**
- Generated β: **-0.030**
- True β: **0.031**
- Sign flip again → same ethnicity construction problem.

**Other race**
- Generated β: **0.053**
- True β: **0.053**
- This one matches well.

**Conservative Protestant**
- Generated β: **0.036**
- True β: **0.066**
- Fix: coding/sample.

**No religion**
- Generated β: **0.023**
- True β: **0.024**
- Matches.

**Southern**
- Generated β: **0.068**
- True β: **0.121**** (**)
- Big mismatch.
- Fix: region coding/sample/weights.

**Political intolerance**
- Generated β: **0.184**** (**)**
- True β: **0.164*** (***)
- Magnitude somewhat higher; significance level differs.
- Fix: your intolerance scale and sample size are almost certainly off; reconstruct scale and missing rules.

**Constant**
- Generated: **7.999**
- True: **6.516**
- Very large mismatch, consistent with different coding/scaling of predictors (notably income and intolerance) and different sample.

**R²/Adj R²/N**
- Generated: 0.149 / 0.111 / 286
- True: 0.169 / 0.148 / 503
- Fix: same as above.

## 4) Standard errors: mismatches in what’s being reported

- **Generated output reports p-values and implies SEs exist**, but you do not print SEs in the coefficient tables shown (only b, beta, p).
- **True Table 1 explicitly does NOT report SEs** (“— not reported”).
- **Mismatch**: If your goal is to match the published table, you should not present SEs/p-values as if they were in the table; you should present **β with stars** and **constants**, plus R²/Adj R²/N.
- **Fix**:
  - Either (A) reproduce the paper’s format: compute standardized β, add stars based on p-values, omit SEs and p-values.
  - Or (B) if you keep p-values/SEs for transparency, clearly label them as **computed from your replication**, not “extracted,” and don’t claim they match Table 1.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches to correct

### “Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)”
- Your generated “Table1style” uses **beta** for predictors and **unstandardized constant**, which is consistent with the true table’s convention.
- But because your **β values differ** (especially for Age, Hispanic, South, Income in Model 3), any narrative interpretation about “stronger/weaker effects” would be wrong relative to the paper.

**Key interpretation errors you must avoid until fixed:**
- Model 2 Age: you would conclude a modest effect; the paper shows a **strong, highly significant positive** association (β=0.140***).
- Model 2 Hispanic: you would conclude positive; the paper shows **slightly negative** (β=-0.029).
- Model 2 Southern: you would conclude weak/non-significant; the paper shows **positive and significant** (β=0.097**).
- Model 3 Income: you would conclude a moderate negative association; the paper shows **near-zero** (β=-0.009).

## 6) How to fix the generated analysis so it matches the true table (action checklist)

1. **Lock the dataset**: confirm it is **GSS 1993** and the same extract as the paper (and the same weighting choice).
2. **Reconstruct DV** exactly: same genre items, same dislike coding, same missing rule.
3. **Rebuild key predictors to stop catastrophic listwise deletion**:
   - Recode/construct **Hispanic** so it is available for most cases (and mutually exclusive with race dummies as in the paper).
   - Reconstruct **political intolerance** scale with the paper’s items and missing-data rule (this is the main reason your Model 3 N collapses).
4. **Confirm region (“Southern”) definition** matches the paper’s (Census region vs “born in South” vs “resides in South”; GSS has multiple).
5. **Confirm income-per-capita definition** matches the paper’s (per-capita vs household; raw vs logged; handling of categories/top-codes). Your Model 3 income β mismatch is too large to be sampling noise.
6. **Re-estimate models on the paper-consistent sample** and output:
   - standardized β for predictors,
   - unstandardized constant,
   - R², adj. R², N,
   - stars using the paper’s thresholds.

If you share your codebook choices (which GSS variables you used for Hispanic, South, political intolerance items, income-per-capita construction, and whether you applied weights), I can pinpoint exactly which recode is producing each sign flip and sample loss.
