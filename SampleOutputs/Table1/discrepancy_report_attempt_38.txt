Score: 42/100
============================================================

Below is a complete item-by-item audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, plus what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the printed table.

---

## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is missing entirely in the generated models**
- **True Table 1** includes **Hispanic** in Model 2 and Model 3.
- **Generated output** explicitly omits it:
  - `note_hispanic: Hispanic omitted: not constructible...`
  - No `hispanic` term appears in Model 2 or 3 coefficient lists.

**Why this matters:** If Hispanic is omitted, *every other coefficient* can shift (omitted-variable bias / re-partitioning of variance), so you should not expect to match Table 1 coefficients, constants, or fit statistics.

**Fix:**
1. Correctly construct a **Hispanic** dummy matching the paper’s coding (usually from a race/ethnicity variable in the GSS: often `hispanic`, `hispan`, `ethnic`, or a composite).
2. Include it in Models 2 and 3 exactly as in Table 1.
3. Ensure the **reference category** matches the table (commonly “White, non-Hispanic” as baseline, with Black/Hispanic/Other dummies).

---

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients**. Your `table1_style` appears to show standardized betas in the first line for each variable, so those should be compared directly to Table 1’s entries.

### Model 1 (SES): mismatches
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | -0.332*** | **Mismatch** (too negative by ~0.010) |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | **Mismatch** |
| Occ prestige | 0.016 | 0.029 | **Mismatch** |

**Fix:** These differences are consistent with *different sample (N)* and possibly *different standardization method*. See Sections 4–6 (sample + standardization + coding).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic): mismatches
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.259*** | **Mismatch** |
| HH income pc | -0.054 | -0.050 | **Mismatch** |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | 0.006 | **Mismatch in sign** |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.089** | **Mismatch (size + sig)** |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.129*** | **Mismatch** |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.030 | ~Match (tiny difference) |
| **Hispanic** | -0.029 | — | **Missing** |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.001 | **Mismatch** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.059 | 0.067 | **Mismatch** |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.004 | **Mismatch** |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.084* | **Mismatch (size + sig)** |

**Fix priority:** Add **Hispanic** and align coding + weighting + standardization; the sign flip on prestige strongly suggests a coding/measurement difference (see Section 6).

---

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): mismatches
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.161** | **Mismatch** |
| HH income pc | -0.009 | -0.012 | **Mismatch** |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | -0.008 | **Mismatch** |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.114* | **Mismatch** |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.060 | **Mismatch (and sig differs)** |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.062 | **Mismatch** |
| **Hispanic** | 0.031 | — | **Missing** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.051 | Close (minor) |
| Cons Protestant | 0.066 | 0.053 | **Mismatch** |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.020 | Close (minor) |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.087 | **Mismatch (and sig differs)** |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.166** | **Mismatch in significance level** (*** vs **) |

**Fix priority:** sample and missingness differences are huge in Model 3 (see Section 4). That alone will alter coefficients and especially p-values/stars.

---

## 3) Standard errors: the generated table prints SEs that the true table does not

### A. True Table 1: **no standard errors printed**
Your “True Results” explicitly states:
- Table 1 reports standardized coefficients only
- **Standard errors are not available from Table 1**

### B. Generated Results: prints a second line per variable that looks like an SE
Example (Model 1):
- educ: `-0.332***` then next line `-0.034` (that line is being used as “SE” in your formatted table)

**Mismatch:** You cannot “match” SEs to Table 1 because Table 1 doesn’t provide them. Also your displayed SE values don’t line up with anything in the true table.

**Fix options:**
1. **Remove SE rows entirely** from the presentation to match Table 1.
2. If you must show uncertainty, compute SEs but **do not claim they match Table 1**; label them clearly as “computed SEs (not reported in Table 1)”.

---

## 4) Sample size (N) mismatches (major)

| Model | True N | Generated N | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Model 1 | 787 | 758 | **Mismatch** (-29) |
| Model 2 | 756 | 756 | **Match** |
| Model 3 | 503 | 426 | **Mismatch** (-77) |

These N differences are large enough to explain many coefficient/significance discrepancies.

**Fix:**
- Reproduce the paper’s **exact case-selection rules**, including:
  - Year restriction (you have `N_year_1993=1606`, so you likely restricted to 1993 correctly, but check the paper)
  - Handling of “Don’t know”, “Refused”, “Not applicable”
  - Construction of the DV and indexes
  - Listwise deletion rules per model (paper may have used different missing-data treatment than you did)
- Model 3 specifically: your `political_intolerance` has **402 missing out of 893** in the working DV sample, leaving only 491 eligible, and after listwise deletion you get 426. The paper reports 503, implying they:
  - had a political intolerance measure available for more cases, **or**
  - constructed the scale with fewer required items / different imputation / different “valid response” definition, **or**
  - used a different source variable set/year/merge.

## 5) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj R², constants)

### R² / Adj R²
| Model | True R² | Gen R² | True Adj R² | Gen Adj R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| M1 | 0.107 | 0.109 | 0.104 | 0.105 |
| M2 | 0.151 | 0.145 | 0.139 | 0.134 |
| M3 | 0.169 | 0.139 | 0.148 | 0.117 |

- M1 is close (likely minor sample/coding differences).
- M2 and especially M3 are notably off; M3 is far lower, consistent with your much smaller N and/or a different intolerance scale.

**Fix:** once you match (a) included variables, (b) coding, and (c) analysis sample, R²/Adj R² should move toward the printed values.

### Constants
| Model | True constant | Generated constant |
|---|---:|---:|
| M1 | 10.920 | 11.086 |
| M2 | 8.507 | 8.788 |
| M3 | 6.516 | 7.355 |

**Fix:** constants depend on the *unstandardized* model specification, coding, and sample. If the paper computed/printed constants from an unstandardized regression while reporting standardized betas for predictors (common), you must replicate that same workflow:
- run the model on raw variables → keep constant from that model
- separately compute standardized betas for predictors (or run on z-scored predictors but keep constant from raw model—papers vary)
Right now your workflow appears internally mixed (standardized betas shown, but constant shown as raw). To match the paper, you must mimic *their* approach.

## 6) Likely coding/measurement discrepancies (driving sign/sig differences)

These are the most plausible culprits given the pattern of mismatches:

### A. **Occupational prestige (prestg80) sign flips in Model 2**
- True: **-0.006**
- Generated: **+0.006**

This is tiny, but the sign difference suggests at least one of:
- prestige coded in opposite direction in your data vs paper’s (unlikely for “prestige”, but possible if it’s a recode)
- different handling of missing prestige (e.g., treating “inapplicable” as 0, etc.)
- different weighting/sample

**Fix:** verify `prestg80` is:
- the same variable the paper used (e.g., `prestg80` vs `sei` vs `occprest`)
- coded so higher = higher prestige
- missing values excluded, not recoded to 0

### B. **Female and Southern significance levels differ**
Example:
- Female in Model 2: True * (p<.05), Generated ** (p<.01)
- Southern in Model 2: True **, Generated *

**Fix:** This can result from:
- different N (not in Model 2), so more likely:
- different standard error estimation (robust vs classical), clustering, or weights
- different exact variable coding (e.g., southern definition, female coding)

To match Table 1, you need to use the same:
- **weights** (GSS often uses `wtssall`/`wtss` depending on year/pooling)
- **SE type** (likely classical OLS SEs if not noted otherwise)
- **two-tailed p-values** (you used two-tailed; keep it)

### C. **Political intolerance scale construction differs (biggest issue)**
Your diagnostics show:
- `political_intolerance_items_required = 15`
- huge missingness for `political_intolerance`

The paper likely used:
- fewer items, or a different item set, or allowed partial completion (e.g., mean of answered items if at least k items present)

**Fix:**
- Recreate the political intolerance index exactly:
  - same items
  - same scoring direction
  - same rule for valid scale score (e.g., require ≥X answered, not all 15)
  - same aggregation (sum vs mean vs factor score)
- This should raise Model 3 N toward 503 and change coefficients/R²/stars.

---

## 7) Interpretation mismatches / reporting mismatches

### A. Claiming you matched Table 1 SEs is impossible
Because Table 1 provides no SEs, any interpretation like “SEs match” would be incorrect.

**Fix:** In your narrative, explicitly state:
- “Table reports standardized coefficients; SEs in our output are computed but not reported in the paper.”

### B. Standardization must be aligned with the paper’s definition
Table 1 says “Standardized OLS coefficients.” That typically means:
- predictors and DV standardized (beta weights), **or**
- software-reported standardized betas (which standardize X and Y)

Your output includes both `beta_std` and `b_raw`. Good—but to match:
- ensure standardization is done on the **analysis sample for that model** (after listwise deletion), not on the full dataset. Standardizing on a different sample yields slightly different betas (enough to explain many ~0.01 differences).

**Fix:** For each model:
1. subset to the final estimation sample
2. z-score DV and all predictors within that subset
3. run OLS on z-scored variables
4. report those coefficients

## What to change (minimal checklist to make generated match true)

1. **Add Hispanic dummy** and include it in Models 2–3.
2. **Rebuild political intolerance** to match the paper:
   - same items, same scoring, same missing-data rule
   - target N≈503 in Model 3
3. **Match sample selection** to reach N=787 (M1) and N=503 (M3):
   - confirm year filter, eligibility, and missing-value handling
4. **Standardize within-model estimation sample** to replicate printed standardized betas.
5. **Stop printing SEs in the “Table 1” mimic** (or label them as computed and not in paper).
6. **Confirm weights and SE type** used in the original (if the PDF indicates weights; if weighted, you must weight all models the same way).

If you paste the paper’s exact variable construction notes (especially the political intolerance index items and missingness rule, and whether weights were used), I can tell you precisely which step in your pipeline must change to hit N=787/756/503 and align each coefficient.
