Score: 59/100
============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of **every mismatch** between the *Generated Results* and the *True (PDF Table 1) Results*, covering **variable naming, coefficients, standard errors, fit stats, N, and interpretation/format**—plus **how to fix each** so the generated analysis reproduces the printed table.

---

## 1) Table format / reporting discrepancies (major)

### 1.1 Standard errors are shown, but the true table does not report them
- **Generated:** prints a second row under each coefficient that appears to be a **standard error** (e.g., educ: `-0.332***` then `0.109` etc.).
- **True:** explicitly states **standardized coefficients only** and **no standard errors printed**.

**Fix**
- Remove SEs from the regression table output entirely (or annotate that SEs are model-estimated but not comparable to the PDF).
- If you must show SEs, you cannot claim they “match Table 1”; instead label them “SEs from replication model (not in Table 1).”

### 1.2 “Standardized OLS coefficients” claim is not matched by the generated computation
- **True:** coefficients are **standardized betas**.
- **Generated:** coefficients appear to be unstandardized or standardized differently; they do not match the printed standardized betas.

**Fix**
- Ensure you are estimating **standardized coefficients** in the same way as the authors:
  - Either run OLS on **z-scored variables** (DV and all continuous IVs), and for binary IVs use 0/1 coding as in the paper.
  - Or compute standardized betas from an unstandardized model using:  
    \[
    \beta^{std}_j = b_j \cdot \frac{s_{x_j}}{s_y}
    \]
- Then print only standardized betas in the table.

---

## 2) Variable name mismatches (minor but important for faithful reproduction)

The PDF uses descriptive names; the generated output uses dataset-coded names. That’s okay *internally*, but the table should match the PDF labels.

| True Table 1 label | Generated term | Status | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Education | `educ` | OK (rename in table) | Print label “Education” |
| Household income per capita | `income_pc` | OK (rename) | Print label exactly as PDF |
| Occupational prestige | `prestg80` | OK (rename) | Print label “Occupational prestige” |
| Female | `female` | OK | Print label “Female” |
| Age | `age` | OK | Print label “Age” |
| Black | `black` | OK | Print label “Black” |
| Hispanic | `hispanic` | OK | Print label “Hispanic” |
| Other race | `other_race` | OK | Print label “Other race” |
| Conservative Protestant | `conservative_protestant` | OK | Print label “Conservative Protestant” |
| No religion | `no_religion` | OK | Print label “No religion” |
| Southern | `southern` | OK | Print label “Southern” |
| Political intolerance | `political_intolerance` | OK | Print label “Political intolerance” |
| DV label | `num_genres_disliked` | OK | Print exactly “Number of music genres disliked” |

**Fix**
- Add a label mapping when producing the table so the displayed variable names match the PDF exactly.

---

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (all models)

These are direct numeric discrepancies between generated standardized betas and the PDF’s printed standardized betas.

### Model 1 (SES): coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332 | -0.322 | too negative by 0.010 |
| HH income pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | too small magnitude by 0.003 |
| Occ prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | too positive by 0.013 |

**Fix**
- This pattern strongly suggests **your standardization and/or sample differs** from the paper (see Sections 5 and 6 on N/listwise and coding).
- Replicate the **exact analytic sample** and coefficient standardization used by the authors.

### Model 2 (Demographic): coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.260 | -0.246 | too negative |
| HH income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | slightly off |
| Occ prestige | 0.007 | -0.006 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.090 | -0.083 | too negative |
| Age | 0.129 | 0.140 | too small |
| Black | 0.004 | 0.029 | far too small |
| Hispanic | 0.034 | -0.029 | wrong sign |
| Other race | 0.001 | 0.005 | small diff |
| Cons Prot | 0.065 | 0.059 | small diff |
| No religion | -0.005 | -0.012 | small diff |
| Southern | 0.085 | 0.097 | too small |

**Fix**
- The **sign errors** (prestige, Hispanic) are not rounding issues; they indicate:
  - different **coding** (e.g., Hispanic coding reversed; prestige scale reversed; race reference categories different), and/or
  - different **model specification** (e.g., missing region/religion dummies in the same way as the authors), and/or
  - different **standardization method** (standardizing after listwise deletion vs. before; weighting; etc.).
- Verify coding:
  - Hispanic should be coded **1=Hispanic** vs **0=non-Hispanic** with the same reference group as the paper.
  - Occupational prestige scale direction should match the PDF’s (higher = more prestige).
  - Race dummies must share the paper’s baseline category (often “White” as omitted).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.136 | -0.151 | too small magnitude |
| HH income pc | -0.031 | -0.009 | too negative |
| Occ prestige | -0.003 | -0.022 | too close to 0 |
| Female | -0.112 | -0.095 | too negative |
| Age | 0.094 | 0.110 | too small |
| Black | 0.012 | 0.049 | too small |
| Hispanic | 0.065 | 0.031 | too large |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.053 | close |
| Cons Prot | 0.058 | 0.066 | close |
| No religion | 0.017 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.091 | 0.121 | too small |
| Political intolerance | 0.188 | 0.164 | too large |

**Fix**
- Biggest red flags:
  - **Political intolerance beta too large** and **N differs** (see Section 5): this often happens if the scale is constructed differently or the sample differs (e.g., excluding “don’t know,” different nonresponse handling).
  - Income and prestige differences suggest either different scaling/standardization or different sample restrictions.

---

## 4) Significance marker mismatches (*, **, ***)

Because the printed table uses significance stars, those must match too.

Examples:
- **Model 3 Education**
  - Generated: `-0.136*`
  - True: `-0.151**`
  - Mismatch in star level.

- **Model 2 Female**
  - Generated: `-0.090**`
  - True: `-0.083*`
  - Mismatch.

- **Model 2 Southern**
  - Generated: `0.085*`
  - True: `0.097**`
  - Mismatch.

**Fix**
- Once (a) the sample, (b) coding, and (c) standardization match the paper, star levels will usually align.
- Also ensure you are using **two-tailed tests** and the same alpha thresholds: *p*<.05, .01, .001 (your generated table appears to use these, but p-values will change with correct replication).

---

## 5) Sample size (N) mismatches (major)

| Model | Generated N | True N | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Model 1 | 758 | 787 | -29 cases |
| Model 2 | 756 | 756 | match |
| Model 3 | 508 | 503 | +5 cases |

**Fix**
- You must reproduce the authors’ **exact listwise deletion rules and construction of DV/IVs**.
- Specific likely causes given your diagnostics:
  - You restricted to `year=1993` and `N_complete_music_18=893`, but the paper’s Model 1 N=787 suggests **different missing-data handling** than your Model 1 listwise (758).
  - Your Model 3 uses 508, but the paper uses 503: indicates differences in:
    - political intolerance scale availability rules,
    - treatment of “don’t know/refused,”
    - or requiring complete data on additional items not shown in your extraction.

Concrete steps:
1. Recreate the DV and each index (especially political intolerance) **exactly** as described in the paper’s methods/appendix (item list, coding, allowed missing, rescaling).
2. Apply **the same eligibility filter** (e.g., survey year, age restrictions, only respondents asked the music battery, etc.).
3. Apply **listwise deletion on the exact same variables included in the model**—no more, no less.
4. If the paper uses weights or design-based restrictions, incorporate them.

## 6) Fit statistics mismatches (major)

| Model | Generated R² | True R² | Generated Adj R² | True Adj R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Model 1 | 0.109 | 0.107 | 0.105 | 0.104 |
| Model 2 | 0.145 | 0.151 | 0.133 | 0.139 |
| Model 3 | 0.152 | 0.169 | 0.131 | 0.148 |

**Fix**
- R²/Adj R² differences are consistent with **different samples and/or different variable construction**.
- Fixes are the same as Sections 3–5: match sample, coding, and standardized-coefficient procedure.
- If the paper used **weighted OLS**, your unweighted R² will not match even with identical sample.

---

## 7) Constant (intercept) mismatches

| Model | Generated constant | True constant | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Model 1 | 11.086 | 10.920 | +0.166 |
| Model 2 | 8.807 | 8.507 | +0.300 |
| Model 3 | 6.507 | 6.516 | -0.009 (close) |

**Fix**
- Intercepts will change with:
  - different sample,
  - different centering/standardization choices,
  - different coding of 0/1 dummies,
  - weights.
- If the paper reports **unstandardized constants** but **standardized betas**, you must do the same (common in some tables):
  - run the model in original units to get the intercept,
  - compute standardized betas separately for the predictors,
  - then print standardized betas + unstandardized constant (as the PDF appears to do, since constants ~10.9, 8.5, 6.5 are not “standardized”).

---

## 8) Interpretation mismatches / claims you must not make

### 8.1 You cannot claim the SEs “match” the PDF
Because the PDF table doesn’t include them.

**Fix**
- State explicitly: “SEs are from the replication model; Table 1 prints standardized coefficients only.”

### 8.2 If you interpret coefficients as unstandardized, that would be wrong relative to the PDF
The paper’s coefficients are standardized. Your narrative must reflect “a 1 SD increase in X is associated with β SD change in Y” (or equivalently standardized effect).

**Fix**
- Update interpretation language to standardized-effect wording.

---

## 9) Practical replication checklist (what to change in the generated analysis)

1. **Use the same analytic sample sizes**
   - Model 1 must end at **N=787**, Model 2 **N=756**, Model 3 **N=503**.
   - Keep adjusting filters and missing-data handling until N matches *exactly*; otherwise coefficients won’t match.

2. **Rebuild Political Intolerance exactly**
   - Your diagnostics show a special rule: `polintol_min_answered_rule = 10`. That may not be what the authors used.
   - Ensure the same items, same coding, same minimum-items rule, and same scaling (0–? vs 0–15 etc.).

3. **Match dummy coding and reference categories**
   - Race dummies: confirm omitted group equals the paper’s omitted group (typically White).
   - Religion: confirm that “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” are defined exactly as the paper defines them (tradition coding schemes vary).
   - Region: confirm “Southern” definition matches Census South used by the authors.

4. **Compute standardized betas the same way**
   - Produce standardized coefficients for predictors (and likely keep intercept unstandardized).

5. **Remove SEs from the table output (or clearly separate them)**
   - To match the printed Table 1, output betas (and stars) only.

---

If you share (a) the paper’s exact variable construction notes for political intolerance and the music-dislike DV, and (b) the code snippet you used to standardize/estimate, I can pinpoint which single step (weights vs listwise vs index rules vs coding) is driving the sign flips (prestige, Hispanic) and the N mismatches.
