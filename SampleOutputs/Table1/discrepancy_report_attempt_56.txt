## 1) Fit statistics: R², adjusted R², N, and “dropped”

### Mismatches
- **Sample sizes (N) are wrong in all models**
  - Generated: **M1 n=747**, **M2 n=507**, **M3 n=286**
  - True: **M1 n=787**, **M2 n=756**, **M3 n=503**
- **R² / Adjusted R² are too low in all models**
  - Generated: M1 **0.088/0.085**, M2 **0.135/0.118**, M3 **0.145/0.111**
  - True: M1 **0.107/0.104**, M2 **0.151/0.139**, M3 **0.169/0.148**
- **“Other race” is incorrectly shown as dropped (NaN) in Models 2–3**
  - Generated: `otherrace` dropped (NaN coefficient)
  - True: “Other race” is included with nonzero β in both M2 and M3.

### How to fix
1. **Replicate the paper’s sample definition and missing-data handling.** Your frames show massive missingness:
   - `num_genres_disliked` missing 44%
   - `pol_intol` missing 47%
   - race dummies missing 35%
   That is not consistent with the paper’s Ns. You’re almost certainly using a different missing-code rule than the authors (e.g., treating “DK/NA/IAP” as missing in a way they did not, or using listwise deletion on variables that weren’t required for earlier models).
2. **Use the same exclusion rules by model** (listwise deletion *within each model*) *after* recoding, matching the paper’s coding:
   - M1 should only require nonmissing on: outcome + education + income + prestige.
   - M2 should require M1 vars + demographics.
   - M3 should require M2 vars + political intolerance.
   Your Ns collapse far more than they should, especially M2 and M3.
3. **Fix “Other race” coding so it varies and is not collinear.**
   - If `black`, `hispanic`, and `otherrace` are coded as three mutually exclusive dummies, you must ensure the omitted category is **White** and that you **do not also include a “white” dummy** or a full set of race dummies plus intercept.
   - Also ensure `otherrace` is not all missing because of a recode error (your missingness table shows 35% missing for all three race dummies—this is suspiciously identical and suggests the underlying race variable is being set to missing too often).

## 2) Variable names: labeling vs actual columns

### Mismatches / discrepancies
- Your tables *display* human-readable names (e.g., “Education (years)”) but the frames use `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`.
- Generated output uses “Other race” but the dropped column is `otherrace`—fine, but it indicates internal inconsistency (label exists while data column is unusable).

### How to fix
- Ensure a single “source of truth” mapping, e.g.:
  - `educ_yrs` → Education
  - `inc_pc` → Household income per capita
  - `prestg80_v` → Occupational prestige
  - `female`, `age_v`, `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south`, `pol_intol`
- Before estimation, assert nonmissing rates and variation for each regressor (especially dummies): `df[col].value_counts(dropna=False)`.

## 3) Coefficients (standardized β) and constants (unstandardized): term-by-term comparison

### Model 1 (SES)
**True β:** educ -0.322***, income -0.037, prestige 0.016, constant 10.920  
**Generated:** educ **-0.292*** (too small in magnitude), income **-0.039** (close), prestige **0.020** (close), constant **10.638** (too low)

**Fix**
- Once N/missingness and coding match, βs and constant should move. The constant discrepancy is also consistent with a different sample and/or different coding of the dependent variable.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
Key mismatches (β):
- Education: generated **-0.264*** vs true **-0.246*** (too negative)
- Age: generated **0.104***? (your output shows `0.104*` only) vs true **0.140*** (too small and wrong significance)
- Hispanic: generated **+0.030** vs true **-0.029** (**sign flips**)
- Southern: generated **0.063** vs true **0.097** (too small; also your p says not sig while true is **)
- Conservative Protestant: generated **0.090** vs true **0.059** (too large)
- Other race: generated **missing/dropped** vs true **0.005** (should be included)
- Constant: generated **9.285** vs true **8.507** (too high)

**Fix**
- **Race/ethnicity coding is wrong** (at minimum Hispanic sign flip + “other race” dropped). Likely issues:
  - Hispanic indicator reversed (1=non-Hispanic coded as Hispanic).
  - Race categories constructed incorrectly (e.g., treating “Hispanic” as a race in a way that differs from the paper).
- **Age variable mismatch**: you use `age_v`; confirm it is in years, not age category, and confirm any top-coding/filters.
- **Southern**: confirm region coding matches “South” definition used in paper (Census region vs “born in South” vs “lives in South”; GSS has multiple region variables).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
Key mismatches (β):
- Education: generated **-0.157***? (shown as `-0.157*`) vs true **-0.151** (close; but true has ** not *)
- Income: generated **-0.050** vs true **-0.009** (far too negative)
- Age: generated **0.083 (ns)** vs true **0.110* ** (too small, wrong inference)
- Other race: generated **missing/dropped** vs true **0.053**
- Southern: generated **0.065 (ns)** vs true **0.121** (too small)
- Political intolerance: generated **0.190** vs true **0.164*** (too large and weaker star in your output: ** vs ***)
- Constant: generated **7.360** vs true **6.516**

**Fix**
- **Political intolerance scaling/coding likely differs.** The paper uses “Political intolerance (0–15)”. You must:
  - verify you’re using the same items, same additive index, same direction, same range, and same handling of missing responses.
- **Income per capita**: your model3 β for income is wildly off relative to the true table, suggesting either:
  - different income measure (e.g., raw household income instead of per-capita, or logged vs unlogged), or
  - per-capita computation differs (household size handling), or
  - heavy sample selection changes the correlation structure.

## 4) Standard errors: reported vs not reported (interpretation error)

### Mismatch
- The **true table does not report standard errors at all**, only β and stars.  
- Your generated results **compute p-values and stars from SEs**, then present them as if comparable to the paper’s stars.

### How to fix
- If the goal is to “match Table 1,” **do not present SEs/p-values as a validation target.** Instead:
  - compute standardized β,
  - apply the same star thresholds only if you are sure you have the same design/weights/specification.
- If you still want inferential stats, label them as “re-estimated from microdata” and don’t claim they are the paper’s.

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

### Mismatches (examples)
- **Model 2 Age:** true is **0.140***; generated is **0.104***? but marked only `*`.
- **Model 2 Southern:** true **0.097**; generated **0.063** and not significant.
- **Model 3 Political intolerance:** true **0.164***; generated **0.190** with only `**`.

### How to fix
- Stars will not align until you align:
  1) the **sample (N)**,  
  2) **variable construction**,  
  3) any **weights/design corrections** (see next section).

---

## 6) Likely omitted requirement: weights / survey design (common in GSS-based papers)

### Discrepancy (inferred)
Your OLS appears unweighted and ignores complex design. Many published GSS analyses use weights (e.g., `WTSSALL` or year-specific weights) and sometimes design-based SEs.

### How to fix
- Check the paper’s methods: if weighted, re-run models with the correct GSS weight.
- Note: weights affect coefficients (sometimes modestly) and SEs (often more).

---

## 7) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the “true” table

1. **Recode the dependent variable** exactly as the authors did (ensure the “number of genres disliked” matches their construction and range; your constant differences suggest it may not).
2. **Rebuild race/ethnicity variables** so that:
   - Hispanic is coded in the correct direction,
   - Other race is nonmissing and not collinear,
   - White is the reference group (intercept included).
3. **Rebuild political intolerance index** to match the paper’s 0–15 scale and missing rules.
4. **Apply the paper’s weight (if used)**.
5. **Use listwise deletion per model** after all recodes; verify you recover approximately **N=787, 756, 503**.
6. **Only compare like with like**:
   - Compare **standardized β** to the table’s β,
   - Compare **unstandardized constants**,
   - Do not treat SEs as mismatches against a table that does not report SEs.

If you share the code that constructs `num_genres_disliked`, the race dummies, and `pol_intol` (plus which weight you used, if any), I can pinpoint the exact recode causing (a) the Hispanic sign flip and (b) the “Other race” NaNs, which are the biggest structural errors.
