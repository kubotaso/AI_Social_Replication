### 1) Fit statistics: **n, R², adjusted R²** all mismatch

| Quantity | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| **Model 1 n** | 747 | 787 | Sample size too small | Use the same casewise deletion rules as the paper/Table 1. Your “missingness” table shows DV nonmissing = 893, so dropping to 747 means you’re excluding extra cases (likely due to different coding/filters, or requiring nonmissing on variables not in Model 1). Restrict listwise deletion to *only* the variables in Model 1. |
| **Model 1 R² / adj R²** | 0.088 / 0.0846 | 0.107 / 0.104 | Too low | Once the sample and variable construction match Table 1 (standardization, coding, weights, etc.), these should rise. Biggest driver is likely mismatch in sample selection and/or standardization. |
| **Model 2 n** | 507 | 756 | Massive mismatch | You are likely (a) requiring nonmissing on **political intolerance** already in Model 2 (you shouldn’t), and/or (b) inadvertently restricting to a subset (e.g., only those with DV+pol_intol). Ensure Model 2 listwise deletion includes only DV + Model 2 predictors (not pol_intol). |
| **Model 2 R² / adj R²** | 0.139 / 0.1196 | 0.151 / 0.139 | adj R² especially too low | Fix sample size and variable coding. Also ensure you’re computing R² from the same model form (OLS with intercept) and same weighting assumptions as the original. |
| **Model 3 n** | 334 | 503 | Too small | You are losing ~169 cases beyond what Table 1 loses. This usually comes from adding extra exclusions (e.g., dropping “don’t know/NA” differently, or using complete-cases on variables not in the model). Reproduce the paper’s missing-data handling and coding for pol_intol and DV. |
| **Model 3 R² / adj R²** | 0.142 / 0.110 | 0.169 / 0.148 | Too low | Same: sample + coding + standardization/weights. |

**Key diagnostic from your own missingness table:**  
- DV nonmissing = **893**; pol_intol nonmissing = **1025**. The *intersection* should be ≤ 893, but Table 1 Model 3 still has **503**, not 334. So you are dropping far more cases than just DV+pol_intol+covariates would imply. That indicates extra constraints (filters, recodes to NA, or unintended joins/merges).

### 2) Variable naming / identity mismatches

- **Generated uses “Education (years)” vs True uses “Education”**  
  Likely OK if it’s truly years of schooling; but if the paper’s “Education” is a different constructed variable (e.g., degree categories transformed), the coefficient will differ.  
  **Fix:** Verify Table 1’s education measure (years vs degree). Use the exact GSS variable and transformation used in the paper.

- **Generated shows “Political intolerance” but missingness table uses `pol_intol`**  
  That’s just a label mismatch (not substantive), but it can conceal a bigger problem: you may be using a different intolerance scale than the paper.  
  **Fix:** Confirm the intolerance index construction (items, scaling direction, missing handling). Then label consistently.

- Race category coding: you list **Black / Hispanic / Other race** (implying White as reference). That matches Table 1’s structure, but signs differ (see below), suggesting coding differences (e.g., Hispanic defined differently, or race mutually exclusive vs overlapping).

### 3) Coefficients (standardized β) mismatches in the “table1style” outputs

Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**. Your `model*_table1style` appears to be reporting standardized betas (not b), so compare those to True. Below are **all** mismatches.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | Too small in magnitude | Likely sample mismatch (n 747 vs 787), education coding, or standardization procedure. Use the paper’s sample and compute β the same way (standardize X and Y or use β = b·SDx/SDy). |
| HH income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | Slight difference | Probably sample/coding; should converge once sample matches. |
| Occ prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | Slight difference | Same. |
| Constant (unstd) | 10.638 | 10.920 | Different | Constant will change with sample, coding, and DV definition. Ensure DV is identical and sample matches. |
| R²/Adj R² | 0.088/0.085 | 0.107/0.104 | Different | Sample/coding/weights. |
| n | 747 | 787 | Different | Listwise deletion only on Model 1 vars. |

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | Too negative | Sample mismatch (507 vs 756) is the big culprit. Fix Model 2 sample first. |
| HH income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | Slight | Same. |
| Occ prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | Slight | Same. |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | Close | Likely resolves with correct sample. |
| **Age** | **0.103***? (your table shows 0.103\*) | **0.140*** | Too small and wrong significance | Sample mismatch and/or age coding (e.g., top-coding, excluding older cases). Ensure age is continuous and coded like the paper. |
| **Black** | **0.100** | **0.029** | Much too large | Race coding likely differs (e.g., your “Black” may be a different reference or includes Hispanics differently). Ensure mutually exclusive race dummies match the paper’s definitions. |
| **Hispanic** | **0.074** | **-0.029** | Wrong sign | Strongly suggests a coding/definition mismatch (Hispanic indicator reversed, or different reference category handling). Recreate exactly: Hispanic=1 for Hispanic respondents; race categories should be mutually exclusive per paper. |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **0.005** | Wrong sign | Same coding issue as above. |
| Cons Prot | 0.087 | 0.059 | Larger | Sample mismatch and/or religion classification mismatch. Verify Conservative Protestant definition used in the study. |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | Close | Minor. |
| **Southern** | **0.061** | **0.097** | Too small and wrong sig (you have ns; true is ** ) | Region coding or sample mismatch. Confirm “South” definition and ensure it’s coded 1=South, 0=non-South; fix sample n. |
| Constant | 8.675 | 8.507 | Different | Sample/coding. |
| R²/Adj R² | 0.139/0.120 | 0.151/0.139 | Different | Sample/coding/weights. |
| n | 507 | 756 | Different | Don’t include pol_intol in Model 2 deletion; fix recodes. |

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | -0.144* | -0.151** | Slightly smaller; significance too weak | Your n is far smaller (334 vs 503), inflating SEs and reducing significance. Fix sample; verify education coding. |
| **HH income pc** | **-0.062** | **-0.009** | Huge mismatch | Very likely you used a different income-per-capita construction (or didn’t match scaling/winsorization) and/or you are using a very different subset of cases. Recreate the income-per-capita variable exactly as in the paper and use correct sample. |
| Occ prestige | 0.008 | -0.022 | Wrong sign | Prestige variable mismatch (different prestige scale/year, or coding reversed), plus sample mismatch. Ensure it’s the same prestige measure as Table 1. |
| Female | -0.122* | -0.095* | Too negative | Sample/coding. |
| **Age** | **0.079** | **0.110*** | Too small and loses significance | Sample/coding. |
| Black | 0.122 | 0.049 | Too large | Same race-coding issue as Model 2. |
| Hispanic | 0.052 | 0.031 | Slight | Sample/coding. |
| Other race | 0.035 | 0.053 | Smaller | Sample/coding. |
| Cons Prot | 0.053 | 0.066 | Smaller | Sample/coding. |
| No religion | 0.027 | 0.024 | Close | Minor. |
| **Southern** | **0.070** | **0.121** | Too small and loses ** | Region coding and sample mismatch. |
| **Political intolerance** | **0.197*** | **0.164*** | Too large | Different intolerance scale, different standardization, and/or sample. Rebuild intolerance measure; ensure direction and scaling match. |
| Constant | 6.464 | 6.516 | Slight | Sample/coding. |
| R²/Adj R² | 0.142/0.110 | 0.169/0.148 | Different | Sample/coding. |
| n | 334 | 503 | Different | Listwise deletion only on Model 3 vars; fix recodes. |

### 4) Standard errors: generated reports SE implicitly (via p-values), but True Table 1 has **no SEs**

- **Mismatch:** Your “generated results” include p-values based on SEs from your estimation; the “true results” explicitly say SEs are not reported in the paper table.  
- **Fix (presentation):** If the goal is to match the paper’s Table 1, **do not report SEs/p-values**; report standardized β and stars only (and constants, R², n).  
- **Fix (substantive comparability):** Even if SEs aren’t shown in Table 1, your significance stars must match. Right now, several stars differ (notably Age and Southern in Models 2–3; Education in Model 3).

---

### 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Comparing your stars to the true ones:

- **Model 2 Age:** Generated `*` vs True `***`  
- **Model 2 Southern:** Generated no star vs True `**`
- **Model 3 Education:** Generated `*` vs True `**`
- **Model 3 Age:** Generated none vs True `*`
- Others may differ due to the coefficient sign/coding issues (e.g., Hispanic in Model 2 is the wrong sign, so any interpretation about Hispanic effects would be wrong).

**Fix:** once you correct (a) sample n, (b) variable construction/coding, and (c) standardization procedure, recompute and then apply the paper’s star cutoffs (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001, two-tailed).

---

### 6) Most likely causes and concrete fixes (to make generated match true)

1) **Wrong samples per model (biggest problem)**
   - Implement **model-by-model listwise deletion**:  
     - Model 1: DV + educ + inc_pc + prestige only  
     - Model 2: DV + Model 2 predictors only (do **not** require pol_intol)  
     - Model 3: DV + Model 3 predictors (including pol_intol)
   - Ensure you are using the **same year (GSS 1993)** and same universe/filters as the paper.

2) **Standardized coefficients must match Table 1**
   - Ensure you are reporting **standardized OLS coefficients β**, not unstandardized b.  
   - Use the same method consistently (common approach: run OLS on z-scored variables, or convert via β = b·SDx/SDy).

3) **Rebuild key constructed variables exactly**
   - **Income per capita:** confirm denominator, handling of 0/NA household size, inflation adjustments (if any), top-coding, and whether log is used (Table 1 suggests linear, but your Model 3 β for income is wildly off—often a construction mismatch).
   - **Political intolerance scale/index:** confirm items included, direction (higher = more intolerant), and missing-data rule (e.g., require all items vs allow partial).
   - **Occupational prestige:** confirm it’s the same prestige scale (e.g., `prestg80` vs other), and how missing occupations are handled.

4) **Fix dummy coding for race/ethnicity**
   - Your Model 2 Hispanic sign reversal strongly suggests your categories aren’t constructed like the paper.  
   - Ensure **mutually exclusive** categories with the same reference group as the paper (almost certainly White non-Hispanic = reference), and that “Hispanic” is not simultaneously counted as Black/Other unless the original did so.

5) **Match weighting/estimation choices**
   - If the paper uses weights (common in GSS), unweighted replication will shift β, R², and stars.  
   - Check paper methods: apply the correct weight variable and use OLS with weights if required.

If you want, paste (a) your exact variable construction code for `inc_pc`, `pol_intol`, race dummies, and (b) your model formulas + any filters/weights. I can pinpoint which line(s) are causing the n collapse and the sign flips.
