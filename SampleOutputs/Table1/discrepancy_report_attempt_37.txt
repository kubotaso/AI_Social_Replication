Score: 59/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches

**A. Dependent variable label**
- **Generated:** “DV: Number of music genres disliked” (OK)
- **True:** same (OK)
- **Fix:** none.

**B. Predictor names differ from Table 1 names (cosmetic but important for matching)**
- **Generated term names:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`
- **True Table 1 names:** Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Political intolerance
- **Mismatch type:** labeling (not necessarily statistical).
- **Fix:** relabel terms in the output table to exactly the Table 1 strings. For example:
  - `educ` → **Education**
  - `income_pc` → **Household income per capita**
  - `prestg80` → **Occupational prestige**
  - etc.

**C. Potential coding-definition mismatch hidden by naming**
Even if labels are fixed, you may still be using *different constructions* than the paper:
- `income_pc`: paper says “Household income per capita.” Your computation may not match theirs (equivalence scale, household size treatment, top-coding, inflation adjustment, log vs level, etc.).
- `political_intolerance`: your variable ranges 0–11 in the sample printout; the paper’s index construction may differ (items included, handling DK/NA, scaling).
- **Fix:** verify each variable’s construction against the paper/codebook and replicate the exact recodes (including missing-value rules).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients**. Your `beta_std` should match those. It does not.

Below are **every coefficient mismatch** (Generated `beta_std` vs True standardized coefficient):

#### Model 1 (SES)
- **Education:** Generated **-0.332** vs True **-0.322** (too negative by 0.010)
- **Household income per capita:** Generated **-0.034** vs True **-0.037** (not negative enough by 0.003)
- **Occupational prestige:** Generated **0.029** vs True **0.016** (too positive by 0.013)

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Education:** Generated **-0.302** vs True **-0.246** (too negative by 0.056)
- **Household income per capita:** Generated **-0.057** vs True **-0.054** (slightly too negative by 0.003)
- **Occupational prestige:** Generated **-0.007** vs True **-0.006** (close)
- **Female:** Generated **-0.078** vs True **-0.083** (less negative by 0.005) AND star differs (see §4)
- **Age:** Generated **0.109** vs True **0.140** (too small by 0.031) AND stars differ
- **Black:** Generated **0.053** vs True **0.029** (too large by 0.024)
- **Hispanic:** Generated **-0.017** vs True **-0.029** (not negative enough by 0.012)
- **Other race:** Generated **-0.016** vs True **0.005** (wrong sign)
- **Conservative Protestant:** Generated **0.040** vs True **0.059** (too small by 0.019)
- **No religion:** Generated **-0.016** vs True **-0.012** (slightly more negative)
- **Southern:** Generated **0.079** vs True **0.097** (too small by 0.018) AND stars differ

#### Model 3 (Political Intolerance)
- **Education:** Generated **-0.157** vs True **-0.151** (slightly too negative) AND stars differ
- **Household income per capita:** Generated **-0.067** vs True **-0.009** (major mismatch)
- **Occupational prestige:** Generated **-0.008** vs True **-0.022** (too close to zero)
- **Female:** Generated **-0.118** vs True **-0.095** (too negative)
- **Age:** Generated **0.092** vs True **0.110** (too small)
- **Black:** Generated **0.004** vs True **0.049** (too small)
- **Hispanic:** Generated **0.091** vs True **0.031** (too large)
- **Other race:** Generated **0.053** vs True **0.053** (matches)
- **Conservative Protestant:** Generated **-0.011** vs True **0.066** (wrong sign)
- **No religion:** Generated **0.018** vs True **0.024** (slightly small)
- **Southern:** Generated **0.073** vs True **0.121** (too small) AND stars differ
- **Political intolerance:** Generated **0.196** vs True **0.164** (too large) AND stars differ

**What this implies:** you are not reproducing the paper’s estimation—this is not just formatting. The pattern (especially N differences and big coefficient shifts) strongly suggests **different sample restrictions, weighting/design corrections, and/or variable construction**.

---

### 3) Standard errors: present in Generated, absent in True

- **Generated:** prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like an SE (e.g., education in Model 1 shows “-0.332***” then “-0.034” underneath).
- **True:** explicitly states **Table 1 prints no standard errors**.

**Mismatch:** you are reporting SEs (or something formatted as SEs) that cannot be compared to Table 1 and makes the table structurally different.

**Fix options (choose one depending on goal):**
1. **To match Table 1 exactly:** remove SE lines entirely and print **standardized coefficients only** with stars.
2. **If you must keep SEs:** then you need the paper’s SEs from another table/model output; otherwise you cannot “match” Table 1. At minimum, label them clearly (e.g., “(robust SE)”) and note Table 1 does not report them.

Also: verify those “SE” rows truly are SEs. In your snippet, the SE for education in Model 1 appears as **0.034** while the standardized beta is **-0.332**; plausible, but you should confirm your table-rendering function isn’t accidentally printing something else (e.g., another coefficient, or raw vs standardized mix).

### 4) Significance stars / p-value interpretation mismatches

The True table’s stars are “as printed” and may be based on **different inference** than your unweighted OLS p-values (your own note says this).

**Examples of star mismatches:**
- **Model 2 Female:** Generated no star (p≈0.061) vs True **-0.083*** (has *).  
- **Model 2 Age:** Generated * (p≈0.012) vs True *** (much stronger).
- **Model 2 Southern:** Generated no star (p≈0.061) vs True ** (p<.01).
- **Model 3 Education:** Generated * (p≈0.024) vs True **.
- **Model 3 Political intolerance:** Generated ** vs True ***.

**Fix:** replicate the paper’s **estimation + inference method**, not just coefficients.
Common causes in sociology survey analyses:
- **Weights:** Use the survey weight the paper used (e.g., GSS wtssall / wtss).
- **Design-based SEs:** account for strata/PSU if applicable (for GSS, often not fully available, but authors may use robust/H-C or survey package approximations).
- **Different alpha/stars:** unlikely here because thresholds match what you printed; the mismatch is from different SE/p-values.

---

### 5) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj R², constants)

#### Sample size (major mismatch)
- **Generated N:** M1=758, M2=523, M3=293  
- **True N:** M1=787, M2=756, M3=503  

This is the single biggest red flag: you are estimating on **much smaller samples**, especially Models 2–3.

**Fix:** align the analytic sample to the paper:
- Ensure you are using the **same year/subsample** restrictions (you show `N_year_1993=1606`, so you likely subset to 1993; confirm the paper did too).
- Ensure you are using the **same missing-data handling**:
  - Your `hispanic` has **281 missing** (612 nonmissing out of 893). That alone collapses Model 2 from 893 to 523. The paper’s Model 2 N=756 suggests **they did not drop 281 cases for Hispanic**.
  - Very likely: in the original data, Hispanic is **0/1 with nonresponse treated as 0**, or coded differently (e.g., a race/ethnicity variable without that missingness), or the paper used **race categories mutually exclusive** without a separate Hispanic item that is mostly missing.
- For Model 3, `political_intolerance` has **402 missing** (491 nonmissing of 893), driving N down to 293 once combined with other missings. The paper’s N=503 suggests their intolerance index/item has far fewer missing values or they used a different variable / imputation / “don’t know” coding.

#### Constants
- **Generated constants:** 11.086, 10.089, 7.583  
- **True constants:** 10.920, 8.507, 6.516  

Even aside from N, these indicate different scaling/sample.

**Fix:** After fixing sample + variable construction + weighting, re-check constants. Also ensure you’re not mixing raw vs standardized outcomes—Table 1 reports standardized betas but still prints an unstandardized constant in the paper (common). You must compute the constant in the same way they did (raw DV with standardized Xs? or raw OLS with unstandardized variables and then standardized betas derived?).

#### R² / Adjusted R²
- **Generated R²:** 0.109, 0.157, 0.152  
- **True R²:** 0.107, 0.151, 0.169  

**Fix:** Once you match sample and specification, R² should move toward the printed values. If still off, check whether the paper used **weighted R²** (some software reports a different “R²” under weights) or a different estimator.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatch: “standardized coefficients” vs what you computed

Your diagnostics say:
> beta_j = b_j * SD(X_j)/SD(Y), computed on each model estimation sample

That is a standard way to compute standardized betas, but it will only match the paper if:
1. **You estimated the same b_j** (same sample, same coding, same weights)
2. **You used the same SD convention** (ddof=1 vs 0 won’t usually cause large differences, but can cause small ones)
3. **You standardized on the same sample** (you do per-model; the paper might standardize on a common sample or on the full sample for that year)

Given your large coefficient and N discrepancies, the main issue is not ddof—it’s sample/coding/weights.

**Fix:** confirm from the paper:
- whether variables were standardized **before** regression (z-scored predictors and/or outcome), or standardized **after** (convert b to beta). Either can yield small differences if done on different samples.

## What to change so the generated analysis matches Table 1

### Priority 1: Reproduce the paper’s analytic sample sizes (N=787, 756, 503)
1. **Fix “Hispanic” missingness**  
   Your Model 2 N collapses mainly because `hispanic` is missing for 281 cases. The paper clearly does not lose that many.  
   - Likely fix: recode missing Hispanic to 0 *if the survey asked only of some respondents*, or replace with a race/ethnicity scheme that matches the paper (e.g., mutually exclusive race categories where Hispanic is not separate / not missing).
   - Alternatively: construct race/ethnicity from a single variable with complete coverage.

2. **Fix “Political intolerance” missingness / construction**  
   Your intolerance variable is missing for 402 cases; the paper’s Model 3 retains 503 cases.  
   - Likely fix: rebuild the intolerance index exactly as in the paper (same items, same treatment of DK/NA, same scaling).
   - If the paper used a single item rather than a summed scale, use that item.

3. **Confirm the exact year/subsample restriction**  
   You appear to use 1993 only. If the paper uses a different wave or pooled years, your Ns and coefficients will not match.

### Priority 2: Apply the same weighting and inference method
- If this is GSS-like, apply the exact weight used in the paper.
- Use the same SE type (classic OLS vs robust vs design-based). This is crucial to match stars.

### Priority 3: Match the table format
- Remove standard errors (Table 1 has none).
- Report standardized coefficients only.
- Ensure stars use the same two-tailed thresholds (you already use the same cutpoints, but p-values must come from the correct SE method).

### Priority 4: Verify variable definitions (income per capita, prestige)
- Income per capita: confirm denominator, missing handling, top-code, inflation adjustment, and whether logged.
- Occupational prestige: confirm it’s the same prestige scale as the paper (you use `prestg80`—likely correct, but verify).
- Religion and region dummies: ensure identical category definitions and reference categories.

## Minimal “acceptance test” to confirm you now match
After implementing the fixes above, check in this order:
1. **Exact N per model** equals **787 / 756 / 503**.
2. Standardized betas for **education** and **political intolerance** are close to **-0.322** and **0.164** respectively (these are large, stable signals).
3. Stars for **Female (Model 2)**, **Age (Model 2)**, **Southern (Models 2–3)**, and **Political intolerance (Model 3)** match the table.

If you share the code you used to construct `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` (and any weights), I can point to the exact lines that are producing the N collapse and coefficient shifts.
