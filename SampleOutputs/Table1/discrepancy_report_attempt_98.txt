============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of mismatches between your **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, covering **variable naming/inclusion, coefficients, (non-)standard errors, fit statistics, Ns, and interpretation/significance**, plus concrete fixes to make the generated analysis match the printed table.

---

## 1) The biggest structural mismatch: you report standard errors, but the true table does not
### What the true results are
- The PDF’s Table 1 reports **standardized OLS coefficients only**.
- It **does not print standard errors**.

### What you generated
- Your `table1_style` includes a second line under each coefficient that looks like a **standard error** (e.g., educ has `-0.310***` then `-0.038`).
- Your `coefficients_long` mixes:
  - `beta_std` (standardized coefficient)
  - `p_raw` (p-values from your re-estimated model)

### Why this is a mismatch
- Any numeric “SE” you print cannot be “true” relative to Table 1, because Table 1 **never reports SEs**.
- Also, the stars in the true table reflect significance from *their* estimation sample/specification; yours are derived from your own re-estimation and can differ.

### How to fix
- **Remove standard error rows entirely** from the table output if your goal is to match Table 1.
- If you must show uncertainty, label it explicitly as **“SE from replication model (not in Table 1)”**—but that will no longer be “matching Table 1.”
- Ensure stars are applied using the same basis as the table you’re matching (see Sections 3–5 on why your p-values differ).

## 2) Variable name mapping: mostly OK, but “hispanic” is broken in your replication
### True table variable
- **Hispanic** is included in Demographic and Political Intolerance models with nonzero coefficients:
  - Demographic: **-0.029**
  - Political intolerance model: **0.031**

### Generated output problem
- `coefficients_long` shows `hispanic` with `beta_std = NaN` in both models.
- `fit_stats` says `dropped_predictors = hispanic`.
- `diagnostics_overall` explicitly admits:  
  *“Not constructible from mapping/available vars; set to 0 for all cases”*

### Why this is a mismatch
- In the true model, Hispanic varies and is estimable.
- You set it to a constant (all zeros), making it **non-estimable**, hence dropped and producing NaN.

### How to fix
- Correct the Hispanic coding from the raw data:
  - Ensure a real binary indicator for Hispanic (or a mutually exclusive race/ethnicity scheme consistent with the original paper).
  - Do **not** hardcode to 0.
- Then refit models; you should obtain a finite standardized coefficient near the reported values.

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

### SES Model (True vs Generated)
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.322*** | **-0.310*** | too small in magnitude |
| HH income pc | **-0.037** | **-0.038** | close (tiny diff) |
| Occ prestige | **0.016** | **0.025** | too large |
| Constant | 10.920 | 10.848 | off |
| R² | 0.107 | 0.097 | too low |
| Adj R² | 0.104 | 0.094 | too low |
| N | 787 | 748 | too low |

**Fixes:** see Sections 4 and 5 (sample restriction, variable construction, and standardization method).

---

### Demographic Model (True vs Generated)
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.246*** | matches |
| HH income pc | -0.054 | -0.052 | close |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | 0.009 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.078* | close |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.114** | too small + wrong sig level |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.023 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | NaN (dropped) | **broken** |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.000 | too small |
| Cons Prot | 0.059 | 0.093* | too large + wrong significance |
| No religion | -0.012 | 0.000 | wrong sign |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.065 | too small + wrong significance |
| Constant | 8.507 | 8.671 | off |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.128 | too low |
| Adj R² | 0.139 | 0.116 | too low |
| N | 756 | 740 | too low |

**Fixes:** Hispanic coding (Section 2) plus alignment of sample and covariate construction (Sections 4–5).

---

### Political Intolerance Model (True vs Generated)
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.150* | sig mismatch |
| HH income pc | -0.009 | -0.015 | too negative |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | -0.006 | too close to 0 |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.095* | matches |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.045 | much too small |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.057 | close |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | NaN (dropped) | **broken** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.048 | close |
| Cons Prot | 0.066 | 0.087 | too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.027 | close |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.064 | too small + wrong sig |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.176*** | too large |
| Constant | 6.516 | 7.199 | off |
| R² | 0.169 | 0.129 | too low |
| Adj R² | 0.148 | 0.106 | too low |
| N | 503 | 418 | far too low |

**Fixes:** again: Hispanic; political intolerance scale construction & missingness; sample alignment.

## 4) N (sample size) mismatches are pervasive and will change *everything*
### True Ns
- SES: **787**
- Demographic: **756**
- Political intolerance: **503**

### Generated Ns
- SES: **748**
- Demographic: **740**
- Political intolerance: **418**

### Why this matters
Different N means you’re estimating on a different subset—coefficients, p-values/stars, and R² will all differ.

### What in your output explains the N loss
- You have substantial missingness (listwise deletion):
  - SES predictors missing: income_pc (72), educ (59), prestg80 (33)
- Political intolerance is missing for **402** of 893 in your constructed “music complete” subset, leaving 491, then listwise down to 418.

### How to fix
To match Table 1, you need to match **their inclusion rules**:
1. **Use the same year/subsample** as the paper (you reference 1993; confirm the paper’s restriction exactly).
2. **Replicate their missing-data handling**:
   - If they used listwise deletion, your N should match theirs once variables are constructed correctly.
   - If they used imputation or different coding that reduces missingness (common for income/prestige), you must replicate that.
3. **Ensure your constructed variables don’t introduce avoidable missingness**, especially:
   - `income_pc` construction (top-coding? using household income categories? equivalence scale?)
   - `prestg80` availability and coding
   - `political_intolerance` scale (see next section)

---

## 5) Variable construction mismatches likely driving coefficient/R² differences

### 5.1 Political intolerance scale: your missingness suggests you built it differently
- True N in intolerance model: **503**
- Your intolerance nonmissing in music-complete: **491**, but final model N: **418**
- You report “items answered mean 9.77” out of max 15—suggesting you require many items or code DK/NA differently than the original.

**Fix**
- Recreate the political intolerance index exactly as the authors:
  - Same items
  - Same coding of “don’t know/refused”
  - Same rule for scale score when some items missing (e.g., allow scale if ≥k items answered; prorate/mean; etc.)
- Once that matches, N should move toward **503** and coefficients/R² should shift toward the printed ones.

### 5.2 Race/ethnicity scheme: “Hispanic” and “Other race” depend on correct mutual exclusivity
If the original table treats race categories as dummies with a reference category, your construction must match:
- Are “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race” mutually exclusive with “White” reference?
- Or is Hispanic treated as ethnicity across races (then must be modeled differently)?

**Fix**
- Implement the same scheme as the paper:
  - If Table 1 includes Black/Hispanic/Other race simultaneously, it usually implies **White (non-Hispanic)** is the omitted category and the dummies are mutually exclusive.
  - Build those indicators accordingly from original race/ethnicity questions.

### 5.3 Standardization method: you must standardize the same way they did
You state: “Standardized betas from z-scored regression.”
That usually matches, but discrepancies can occur if:
- They standardized using **sample SD after listwise deletion** (per model), while you standardized on a different base
- They standardized **only Xs**, not Y (or vice versa); standardized beta in OLS is typically equivalent to z-scoring both, but not if done inconsistently.

**Fix**
- Standardize **exactly as they did** (ideally: compute standardized coefficients from the covariance matrix on the estimation sample for each model).
- Confirm whether the constant in the true table is from unstandardized Y (it is), while betas are standardized—this hybrid presentation is common. If so, don’t z-score Y when generating the constant.

---

## 6) Fit statistics mismatches (R²/Adj R², constants)
All three of your R² and Adj R² are **lower** than the true table, consistent with:
- smaller / different N
- misconstructed predictors (notably Hispanic, intolerance scale)
- possibly different weighting (if the original used survey weights)

**Fix**
- Check whether the original analysis uses **weights** (GSS weights, etc.). If yes, weighted OLS will change betas and R².
- Match the model’s weighting and design choices.

---

## 7) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation errors)

### Education in Political Intolerance model
- True: **-0.151\*\*** (p < .01)
- Generated: **-0.150\*** (p < .05)

### Age in Demographic model
- True: **0.140\*\*\*** (p < .001)
- Generated: **0.114\*\*** (p < .01)

### Southern in both models
- True: **0.097\*\*** and **0.121\*\***
- Generated: **0.065 (ns)** and **0.064 (ns)**

These are not “interpretation” issues; they’re downstream of incorrect replication (sample, variable coding, weights, or SE computation). Fixing construction/sample should fix stars.

Also: because Table 1’s stars are “as printed,” you should not claim your p-values “match” unless you exactly replicate their method.

---

## 8) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Stop printing SEs** in the “Table 1 match” output (Table 1 doesn’t have them).
2. **Fix Hispanic**:
   - derive from the correct source variable(s)
   - ensure it varies; ensure correct reference group with other race dummies
3. **Rebuild political intolerance index** to match authors’ rules and missing-data handling.
4. **Match the estimation sample**:
   - same year restriction
   - same exclusions
   - same missing-data policy
5. **Check weights**:
   - if the paper uses weights, rerun weighted standardized OLS.
6. **Ensure standardization is identical**:
   - standardized betas computed on the model’s estimation sample
   - keep constant as in the paper (likely unstandardized DV)

If you want, paste (a) your variable construction code for `hispanic`, `other_race`, and `political_intolerance`, and (b) whether you used weights. I can then pinpoint exactly which coding/recoding choices are causing each coefficient to drift (especially age, southern, prestige, and conservative protestant).
