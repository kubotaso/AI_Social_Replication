Score: 40/100
============================================================

## 1) Fit statistics: n, R², adjusted R² (all mismatch)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **n:** Generated **747** vs True **787** → mismatch
- **R²:** Generated **0.088** vs True **0.107** → mismatch
- **Adj. R²:** Generated **0.085** vs True **0.104** → mismatch

**How to fix**
- Ensure you are using the **same sample restrictions as the paper**. Your “missingness” table suggests large missingness on other variables, but Model 1 should only drop cases missing **num_genres_disliked, educ, inc_pc, prestige**.  
- Recreate paper’s construction for income per capita and prestige (and any top/bottom coding).
- Use the same **survey year/subsample** (paper says **GSS 1993**). Any inclusion of other years or weights will change n and R².

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **n:** Generated **507** vs True **756** → mismatch (very large)
- **R²:** Generated **0.139** vs True **0.151** → mismatch
- **Adj. R²:** Generated **0.120** vs True **0.139** → mismatch (big)

**How to fix**
- Your sample is collapsing mainly because your `hispanic` variable has ~35% missingness in your pipeline. In most GSS-style coding, **Hispanic is usually derived from ethnicity/race and should not be that missing**.
- Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies to match the paper (see Section 2.3 below), and confirm you are not inadvertently requiring non-missing on a variable not used in the model (common error: building a “complete-case” dataset once and reusing it for all models).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **n:** Generated **286** vs True **503** → mismatch (very large)
- **R²:** Generated **0.149** vs True **0.169** → mismatch
- **Adj. R²:** Generated **0.111** vs True **0.148** → mismatch (big)

**How to fix**
- Your `pol_intol` has **47% missingness**, which is likely not how the paper constructed the political intolerance scale/index. You’re probably (a) using the wrong source items, (b) treating “don’t know/refused/not asked” as NA rather than recoding, or (c) requiring complete non-missing across too many items instead of allowing partials.
- Reconstruct *political intolerance* exactly as the paper did (same items, same scaling, same missing-data rule). Then re-run Model 3 on the Model 2 estimation sample intersected with non-missing political intolerance.

## 2) Coefficients (β) and constants: variable-by-variable mismatches

### Important global mismatch: you are mixing **unstandardized b** and **standardized β**
- The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** and **constants unstandardized**.
- Your “table1style” outputs are **β values**, but your “full” outputs include both `b` and `beta`.
- For matching Table 1 you must compare **only β** (and constants as unstandardized intercepts).

### 2.1 Model 1 (SES): mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | No |
| Income per capita | -0.039 | -0.037 | Close, not exact |
| Occupational prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | Close, not exact |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | No |

**How to fix**
- The direction/pattern matches, so the likely problem is **measurement/coding differences** (education years coding, prestige scale version, income-per-capita construction, inflation adjustments, trimming).
- Verify:
  - Education: ensure it is **years** and matches the paper’s coding (no GED recode differences, no “in school” handling differences).
  - Prestige: the paper likely uses a specific GSS prestige variable (you use `prestg80_v`). Confirm it matches the paper’s prestige measure.
  - Income per capita: confirm definition (household income / household size) and whether income categories were converted to midpoints and whether household size missing handling differs.

### 2.2 Model 2 (Demographic): mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.265*** | **-0.246*** | No |
| Income per capita | -0.051 | -0.054 | Close, not exact |
| Occupational prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | Close, not exact |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | Close (ok-ish) |
| Age | **0.103*** (actually only * in your output) | **0.140*** | No (size + stars) |
| Black | **0.100** | **0.029** | No (big) |
| Hispanic | **0.074** | **-0.029** | No (sign flips) |
| Other race | **-0.027** | **0.005** | No (sign flips) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.087 | 0.059 | No |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | Close |
| Southern | **0.061** | **0.097** | No |

**How to fix (core culprits)**
1. **Race/ethnicity dummy construction is not matching the paper**
   - Your results show **Hispanic positive** and **Other race negative**, while the paper shows Hispanic slightly negative and other race slightly positive.
   - Your `missingness` shows **hispanic has 35% missing**, which strongly indicates misconstructed ethnicity.
   - Fix by:
     - Using the same **reference group** as the paper (almost certainly **non-Hispanic White**).
     - Ensuring **Hispanic is coded as Hispanic regardless of race** if that’s what the paper did (many papers treat Hispanic as an ethnicity indicator).
     - Making “Black” and “Other race” mutually exclusive and consistent with Hispanic coding rules used in the paper.

2. **Age coefficient and significance do not match**
   - Paper: **0.140***; Generated: **0.103***? (your p=.019 so it’s only `*`, not `***`).
   - Likely due to **sample mismatch (n 507 vs 756)** and/or **age scaling** (years vs decades) or restrictions (age range).
   - Confirm age is in **years** and not top-coded differently, and fix sample selection (above).

3. **Southern and religion effects off**
   - Often caused by differences in how “South” is defined (Census South vs “born in South” vs region categories) and how “Conservative Protestant” is defined (RELTRAD vs denomination).
   - Rebuild:
     - `south` exactly as paper (likely Census region South).
     - `cons_prot` exactly as paper’s classification (not just “Protestant”; must be conservative Protestant).

### 2.3 Model 3 (Political intolerance): mismatches
| Term | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | No (stars) |
| Income per capita | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | No (huge) |
| Occupational prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | No |
| Female | -0.127* | -0.095* | No |
| Age | 0.091 (ns) | 0.110* | No (stars) |
| Black | 0.060 | 0.049 | Close |
| Hispanic | -0.030 | 0.031 | No (sign flip) |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | **Match** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.036 | 0.066 | No |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | **Match/very close** |
| Southern | **0.068** | **0.121** | No |
| Political intolerance | 0.184** | 0.164*** | No (size + stars) |
| Constant | **7.999** | **6.516** | No |

**How to fix (biggest issues)**
1. **Income per capita effect is wildly different**
   - Generated β ≈ -0.052 vs true β ≈ -0.009.
   - That magnitude shift usually happens when:
     - income per capita was **recomputed** on a much smaller, selective sample (you have n=286),
     - income is **logged** vs not, or scaled differently,
     - or you accidentally standardized using a different SD (e.g., standardizing within the estimation sample vs full sample; Table 1 β should come from the model’s estimation sample, but if your sample is wrong β will be wrong).
   - Fix: correct Model 3 sample and income construction first; then re-check.

2. **Political intolerance variable construction/scope is wrong**
   - Your Model 3 uses n=286 vs true 503 and produces different significance.
   - Fix:
     - Rebuild the intolerance scale/index and missing-data rule.
     - Confirm you are not using a subset item (e.g., one question) when the paper used an index, or vice versa.

3. **Constant differs strongly**
   - True constant 6.516 vs generated 7.999.
   - Intercepts are sensitive to coding, centering, and sample composition; again points to wrong sample and/or different coding of key predictors.

## 3) Standard errors: required mismatches vs “not applicable”
- The user request asks to compare **standard errors**, but the **True Results explicitly say SE are not reported** in the paper table.
- Your generated output includes p-values (thus it had SE internally), but you did not print SE.

**How to fix**
- If your goal is to match the paper’s Table 1, **do not report SE** (or report them separately with a note they are not in the published table).
- If you want internal validation, extract and show SE from your model summary, but you cannot “match” them to the table because the table doesn’t provide them.

## 4) Interpretation/significance-star mismatches

### Model 3 political intolerance
- Generated: **0.184\*\*** (p=.0038)  
- True: **0.164\*\*\*** (p<.001)

**How to fix**
- With correct sample and variable construction, the p-value should move. Also confirm:
  - two-tailed test,
  - same df (OLS with listwise deletion),
  - no robust/clustered SE if the paper used classical OLS SE.

### Model 2 Age and Southern significance
- Generated: Age only `*` (p=.019), Southern ns; True: Age `***`, Southern `**`.
**Fix:** correct sample + correct region coding.

## 5) Variable name mismatches (labels vs underlying vars)
These aren’t fatal, but they matter for reproducibility:
- Generated uses `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, `age_v`, `pol_intol`; True table labels are generic (Education, etc.).
- Your displayed terms include “Education (years)” etc., but your missingness table uses raw names.

**How to fix**
- Provide a **codebook mapping** in the analysis output:
  - `educ_yrs` → Education (years)
  - `inc_pc` → Household income per capita (specify currency year/deflation and divisor)
  - `prestg80_v` → Occupational prestige (specify scale)
  - `age_v` → Age (years)
  - `pol_intol` → Political intolerance (specify index/items)

---

## 6) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Filter to GSS 1993** exactly as the paper did.
2. **Recreate dependent variable** exactly (Number of music genres disliked): same items, same counting rule, same missing rule.
3. **Recreate predictors**:
   - Education years coding consistent with paper.
   - Income per capita: same transformation from categorical income, same household-size handling, same currency/deflation assumptions.
   - Prestige: same prestige variable/scale.
   - Race/ethnicity: same dummy scheme and reference category; eliminate the spurious missingness for Hispanic.
   - Conservative Protestant and No religion: same religious tradition coding as paper.
   - Southern: same region coding.
   - Political intolerance: same items + scoring + missing rule (this is currently the major source of n loss).
4. **Run OLS with listwise deletion per model**, not a single “complete-case for all variables” dataset.
5. **Report standardized coefficients (β)** for all non-constant terms and **unstandardized intercept**; omit SE in the table (or label them “not reported” if you include a comparison table).
6. **Apply the same star thresholds** (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001, two-tailed).

If you provide the code (R/Stata/Python) that produced the generated results—especially how you built `hispanic` and `pol_intol`—I can point to the exact lines causing the n collapses and sign flips.
