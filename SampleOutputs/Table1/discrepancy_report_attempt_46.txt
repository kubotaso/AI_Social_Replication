Score: 42/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: **R², adjusted R², and N are wrong (all models)**

**Mismatches (Generated → True)**  
- **Model 1 (SES)**: N **747** → **787**; R² **0.088** → **0.107**; Adj R² **0.085** → **0.104**  
- **Model 2 (Demographic)**: N **507** → **756**; R² **0.139** → **0.151**; Adj R² **0.120** → **0.139**  
- **Model 3 (Political intolerance)**: N **334** → **503**; R² **0.142** → **0.169**; Adj R² **0.110** → **0.148**

**What this implies**  
Your generated regressions were estimated on *much smaller analytic samples* than the paper. That will change coefficients, significance, and model fit.

**How to fix**
- Reproduce the paper’s **exact sample restrictions**:
  - Same year/module (GSS 1993) and same universe for the music dislikes DV.
  - Same handling of missing data: likely **listwise deletion within each model**, but the paper’s N indicates *far less attrition* than your Model 2/3.
- Verify recodes for all covariates match the paper (see sections below), because miscoding can create extra missingness.
- Ensure you’re not accidentally dropping cases via merges, “don’t know/refused” recodes to NA, or by restricting to only those with political intolerance in Models 1–2 (you should not).

### 2) Variable names/measurement: **labeling looks fine, but coding almost certainly differs**
There are no *pure naming* mismatches (you have the same conceptual variables), but the *results* indicate coding differences for at least:
- **Age** (effect size and significance differ strongly)
- **Race dummies** (sign flips for Hispanic/Other race)
- **Southern** (stronger in true results; your p-values don’t match reported stars)
- **Political intolerance** (your standardized β is too large vs true; unstandardized b doesn’t correspond to the paper’s β because the paper reports only β)

**How to fix**
- Match the paper’s **dummy coding and reference categories** exactly:
  - Race: confirm reference is **White**; ensure Hispanic is coded as a dummy consistent with the paper (some GSS “Hispanic” variables are ethnicity, not mutually exclusive with race).
  - Religion: confirm definitions for **Conservative Protestant** and **No religion** match the author’s classification (often based on denomination + fundamentalism, not a simple denom flag).
  - Southern: confirm it is **South region** as in the paper (often Census region), not “born in South” or “lives in South at age 16,” etc.
- Ensure **DV** matches: “Number of music genres disliked” should be constructed exactly as in the paper (same set of genre items, same dislike threshold, same handling of “don’t know”).

### 3) Coefficients: **standardized betas do not match the true table (all models)**

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** and stars; your “Table1style” uses the generated **beta** column, which is correct in concept, but the values don’t match.

#### Model 1 (SES): β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | close (minor diff) |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | slightly high |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | too low |

#### Model 2 (Demographic): β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | slightly off |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | slightly off |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close |
| Age | 0.103* | 0.140*** | **too small; wrong significance** |
| Black | 0.100 | 0.029 | **way too large** |
| Hispanic | 0.074 | -0.029 | **wrong sign** |
| Other race | -0.027 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Cons Prot | 0.087 | 0.059 | too large |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | close |
| Southern | 0.061 | 0.097** | too small; wrong significance |
| Constant | 8.675 | 8.507 | off |

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance): β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.144* | -0.151** | slightly off; wrong star level |
| Income pc | -0.062 | -0.009 | **much too negative** |
| Prestige | 0.008 | -0.022 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.122* | -0.095* | too negative |
| Age | 0.079 | 0.110* | too small; wrong significance |
| Black | 0.122 | 0.049 | too large |
| Hispanic | 0.052 | 0.031 | off |
| Other race | 0.035 | 0.053 | off |
| Cons Prot | 0.053 | 0.066 | off |
| No religion | 0.027 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.070 | 0.121** | too small; wrong significance |
| Pol intolerance | 0.197*** | 0.164*** | too large |
| Constant | 6.464 | 6.516 | close |

**How to fix**
- First fix the **analytic N** (Section 1). Coefficients will move toward the paper once the sample aligns.
- Then fix **coding of income per capita** (Model 3 is a red flag): true β is near zero (-0.009), but yours is -0.062. That often happens if:
  - income was rescaled incorrectly (e.g., not per capita, or dividing by household size incorrectly),
  - “income” is logged in the paper but not in yours (or vice versa),
  - top-coding or category-to-midpoint conversion differs.
- Fix **Hispanic and Other race** sign problems by verifying how ethnicity and race are combined. If “Hispanic” is treated as a race category in the paper, you must ensure mutually exclusive categories (e.g., Hispanic overrides race) rather than a separate dummy that overlaps with Black/White/Other.

### 4) Standard errors and p-values: **your output reports them; the true table does not**
The true results explicitly say **SEs not reported** (Table 1 shows only β and stars). Your generated tables include p-values and SE is absent, but p-values come from your estimation and are inconsistent with the paper’s stars in several places (Age, Southern, Education in Model 3).

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to “match Table 1,” do **not** present SEs/p-values as if they were validated against the paper. Present only:
  - β (standardized)
  - stars based on your p-values (but note they may not match unless the model/specification matches exactly)
  - constants unstandardized
- Once the model truly matches (same sample + coding), your p-values/stars should align more closely with the paper’s stars.

---

### 5) Interpretation/significance: **several star levels are wrong relative to the true table**

Key mismatches:
- **Model 2 Age**: Generated `0.103*` but true is `0.140***`.
- **Model 2 Southern**: Generated `0.061` (ns) but true is `0.097**`.
- **Model 3 Education**: Generated `-0.144*` but true `-0.151**`.
- **Model 3 Age**: Generated `0.079` (ns) but true `0.110*`.
- **Model 3 Southern**: Generated `0.070` (ns) but true `0.121**`.

**How to fix**
- Again, this is almost certainly driven by (a) wrong N due to missingness/sample restriction and (b) variable construction differences.
- After aligning data construction, confirm you are using:
  - **OLS**, not robust SEs (unless the paper did—Table 1 doesn’t say).
  - **two-tailed tests** with the same thresholds (*, **, ***). Your thresholds match the note, so that’s fine.

---

### 6) “Dropped” and missingness diagnostics: **your missingness pattern conflicts with the paper’s N**
Your missingness table shows heavy missingness on:
- `num_genres_disliked` missing 44%
- `pol_intol` missing 36%
- `hispanic` missing 35%

Yet the paper’s Ns (787, 756, 503) imply the author retained many more observations than your Models 2/3.

**How to fix**
- Check whether you accidentally coded valid responses as missing (common with GSS codes like 8/9, 98/99, etc.).
- Ensure you’re using the **same source variable** for Hispanic and political intolerance as the paper. A 35% missing rate for Hispanic suggests you may be using a variable not asked of everyone or not present in 1993 in the way you expect.
- Recreate the DV with correct missing rules; 44% missing is plausible only if the DV is built from many genre items and you require complete data on all items. The paper may allow partial completion (e.g., count dislikes among asked items) or use a smaller set.

## Summary of what to change (to make generated match true)
1. **Replicate sample selection** for each model to match reported N (787/756/503).  
2. **Recode all predictors to match the paper** (especially race/ethnicity construction; age; South; religion classification; income-per-capita scaling).  
3. **Construct the DV exactly as the paper** (same genre items + same missing-data rule).  
4. Report **standardized β** (as you do) and **unstandardized constants**, and don’t claim SE comparability since Table 1 omits SEs.  
5. After 1–3, re-run OLS; your βs and stars should converge to the true table.

If you share your exact variable construction (how you computed `num_genres_disliked`, `inc_pc`, `pol_intol`, and how you defined Hispanic/race categories), I can pinpoint the precise coding step causing each sign/magnitude error.
