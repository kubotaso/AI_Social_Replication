Score: 39/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches

- **DV label**
  - **Generated:** “DV: Number of music genres disliked” (OK)
  - **True:** same (OK)
  - **Fix:** none.

- **Income variable label**
  - **Generated term:** `income_pc`
  - **True table label:** “Household income per capita”
  - **Mismatch:** naming/labeling only (not necessarily the underlying variable if coded correctly).
  - **Fix:** relabel `income_pc` in the table output to exactly “Household income per capita” (and confirm the construction matches the original study—see section 5).

- **Occupational prestige label**
  - **Generated term:** `prestg80`
  - **True table label:** “Occupational prestige”
  - **Mismatch:** naming/labeling only.
  - **Fix:** relabel `prestg80` to “Occupational prestige”.

- **Political intolerance label**
  - **Generated term:** `political_intolerance`
  - **True table label:** “Political intolerance”
  - **Mismatch:** minor (underscore vs space).
  - **Fix:** relabel to “Political intolerance”.

Everything else (educ/female/age/black/hispanic/other_race/conservative_protestant/no_religion/southern) matches in substance, though capitalization differs.

### 3) Standard error mismatches (and why they’re fundamentally wrong here)

- **True result:** The PDF Table 1 **does not report standard errors at all** (only standardized coefficients and stars).
- **Generated output:** prints a second row under each coefficient that *looks like standard errors* (e.g., “-0.034***” then “-0.034” then “0.029”…), but these numbers are not aligned with the true table and **cannot be validated** against the PDF.

**Fix options (choose one):**
1. **Best match to the true table:** **Remove standard errors entirely** from the generated table and print only standardized coefficients + significance stars, just like the PDF.
2. If you want SEs anyway: you must compute them from the microdata and then you are no longer matching “Table 1 as printed.” In that case, you should clearly label: “Standard errors computed from replication data; not shown in original Table 1.”

Right now the generated table is claiming an apples-to-oranges comparison: it looks like it reproduces a printed table with SEs, but the “true” table never had them.

---

### 4) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars and substantive claims)

Because many coefficients differ, several **star assignments also differ**:

- **Model 2 female:** Generated not significant (p≈0.062) vs True *significant* (*).
- **Model 2 age:** Generated * vs True ***.
- **Model 2 southern:** Generated not significant vs True **.
- **Model 3 education:** Generated * vs True **.
- **Model 3 age:** Generated not significant vs True *.
- **Model 3 southern:** Generated not significant vs True **.
- **Model 3 political intolerance:** Generated ** vs True ***.

**Fix:** you cannot “fix stars” by changing thresholds—your p-values are coming from a different model/sample/spec. To match the PDF you must match:
- the **analytic sample** (N),
- the **exact variable codings**, and
- the **standardization procedure** used for betas/stars.

---

### 5) The biggest structural problems causing mismatches (and how to fix)

#### A) Your estimation samples (N) do not match the true table
- **True N:** 787 / 756 / 503
- **Generated N:** 758 / 523 / 293

This is the dominant discrepancy and will change coefficients, p-values, constants, and fit stats.

**Why it’s happening (from your diagnostics):**
- You are dropping huge numbers of cases due to missingness, especially:
  - `hispanic` has **281 missing**
  - `political_intolerance` has **402 missing**

Those drops are exactly why Model 2 and Model 3 N collapse.

**Fix:** replicate the original missing-data handling. Common possibilities in published sociology tables:
1. **Different variable coding with fewer missings** (e.g., Hispanic derived from race/ethnicity differently, or missing treated as 0 for “not Hispanic” when appropriate).
2. **Using a different base sample** (e.g., restricting to respondents asked certain modules; you may be using a subset).
3. **Imputation or missing indicators** (less likely in a “Table 1” unless stated, but possible).
4. **Pairwise deletion** (rare for OLS tables, but sometimes used incorrectly); however, your table looks like listwise deletion.

To match the printed table Ns, you must:
- Reconstruct `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` exactly as the authors did (including their missing-code recodes like 8/9/98/99 → NA, or sometimes → 0 depending on skip logic).
- Ensure you’re using the same survey year subset and same eligibility rules as the paper (you show `N_year_1993=1606`, DV complete=893; the true table N suggests they keep many more covariate-complete cases than you do).

#### B) You are likely not using the same weighting/design as the original
Even if OLS coefficients are similar, **standard errors/stars** can change a lot if the original used:
- survey weights,
- clustering/stratification,
- robust SEs.

**Fix:** check the paper’s methods section:
- If they used GSS weights (common), apply the same weight in estimation.
- If they used design-based SEs, use survey regression procedures.

#### C) Standardization procedure for betas may not match
The true table reports standardized coefficients. Your `beta_std` appears to be standardized, but if you:
- standardized using the analysis sample vs full sample,
- standardized after weighting vs before weighting,
- standardized dummy variables differently,

you can get different betas.

**Fix:** mirror the paper’s beta computation:
- Typically: run unstandardized OLS, then compute standardized betas as \(b \times (SD_X / SD_Y)\) using the **same estimation sample** (and weights if used).
- Confirm whether Y was standardized or not (tables usually standardize coefficients, not the DV itself, but mathematically equivalent if done consistently).

#### D) Coding differences are suggested by sign flips
Sign flips in Model 2 and Model 3 for `hispanic`, `other_race`, `black`, and `conservative_protestant` strongly suggest **you are not matching reference categories or construction**.

Examples:
- **Hispanic:** Generated +0.029 (Model 2) vs True -0.029.
- **Other race:** Generated -0.016 vs True +0.005.
- **Black (Model 3):** Generated ~0 vs True +0.049.
- **Conservative Protestant (Model 3):** Generated negative vs True positive.

**Fix:** verify each categorical variable definition:
- What is the omitted/reference group? (Often “White, non-Hispanic”.)
- Are race and Hispanic overlapping or mutually exclusive in the paper?
- Is “Conservative Protestant” coded among Protestants only, or among all respondents (with others = 0)? Is it a denomination variable or a religious tradition typology?
- Are you inadvertently including “missing” as a category or coding it as 0?

---

### 6) Presentation mismatch: constants and what the table is supposed to be
The true table prints:
- standardized coefficients for predictors,
- **unstandardized constants**, and
- R²/Adj R²/N.

Your generated output mixes a standardized-coefficient table with what look like extra numeric rows that are not in the true table.

**Fix to match the PDF Table 1 layout:**
- Show one row per predictor with the standardized beta and stars.
- Do **not** print SE rows.
- Keep constant, R², Adj R², N.

---

### Summary of what to change so the generated analysis matches the true table
1. **Match the analytic Ns (787/756/503)** by fixing missing-data handling and variable construction—especially `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`.
2. **Recreate variable codings and reference categories** to eliminate sign flips (race/ethnicity and religion variables are the biggest red flags).
3. **Use the same weights/design/SE approach** as the original study (affects stars and potentially betas if weighted).
4. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way** (same sample, weights, SDs).
5. **Remove standard errors from the output** (the true table doesn’t report them) or clearly state they’re not part of the published table.

If you share (a) the code that constructs `hispanic`, `conservative_protestant`, and `political_intolerance`, and (b) whether you applied weights, I can point to the exact coding/design choices most likely responsible for the N collapse and coefficient sign reversals.
