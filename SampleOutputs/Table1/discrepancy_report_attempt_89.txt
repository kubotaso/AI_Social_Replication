Score: 40/100
============================================================

### 1) The biggest structural mismatch: **your generated table includes standard errors, but the “true” Table 1 does not**
- **Generated:** prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like a **standard error** (e.g., educ in Model 1: `-0.310***` then `-0.038`).
- **True:** explicitly states **Table 1 reports standardized coefficients only and does not print SEs**.

**Fix**
- Do **not** print SEs in the table if you are trying to match the PDF Table 1.
- If you must report SEs, you need to extract them from a different table/output (or re-estimate the model from the same data and report them—but then you won’t “match Table 1” unless the data, weights, and sample restrictions are identical).

## 2) Mismatches in coefficients (by model/variable)

Below I list every coefficient mismatch between **Generated** (from `coefficients_long`) and **True**.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.310 | -0.322 | yes |
| income_pc | -0.038 | -0.037 | slight |
| prestg80 | 0.025 | 0.016 | yes |

**Fix**
- Ensure you are producing **standardized betas the same way** as the PDF.
  - Common mismatch: you standardized *after* listwise deletion / using a different sample than the PDF.
  - Another common mismatch: you standardized using a package’s default (e.g., `scale()` with sample SD) but the PDF used a different standardization convention (rare) or used **weights**.
- Most importantly: your **N differs** (see section 4). Standardized betas will shift with sample changes.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.289 | -0.246 | yes (large) |
| income_pc | -0.050 | -0.054 | small |
| prestg80 | -0.004 | -0.006 | tiny |
| female | -0.080 | -0.083 | tiny |
| age | 0.095 | 0.140 | yes (large) |
| black | 0.099 | 0.029 | yes (large) |
| hispanic | -0.074 | -0.029 | yes |
| other_race | -0.016 | 0.005 | yes (sign differs) |
| conservative_protestant | 0.089 | 0.059 | yes |
| no_religion | -0.013 | -0.012 | tiny |
| southern | 0.066 | 0.097 | yes |

**Fix**
- This pattern (big differences for age/race/education) strongly suggests you are **not estimating on the same analytic sample** and/or **not using the same coding** for demographic variables.
- Check especially:
  1) **Race/ethnicity coding**: the PDF likely uses mutually exclusive categories with a specific reference group (usually White, non-Hispanic). Your variables `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` might not be mutually exclusive (or “hispanic” may overlap with race), which can substantially change coefficients.
  2) **Age scaling**: if the PDF uses age in years but you standardized differently (or used a subset), betas change.
  3) **Weights** (again): if the PDF uses survey weights and you didn’t, coefficients can move a lot.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.160 | -0.151 | small (but sig differs: * vs **) |
| income_pc | -0.054 | -0.009 | yes (large) |
| prestg80 | -0.011 | -0.022 | yes |
| female | -0.124 | -0.095 | yes |
| age | 0.082 | 0.110 | yes |
| black | 0.061 | 0.049 | small |
| hispanic | 0.030 | 0.031 | matches |
| other_race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| conservative_protestant | 0.037 | 0.066 | yes |
| no_religion | 0.024 | 0.024 | matches |
| southern | 0.069 | 0.121 | yes |
| political_intolerance | 0.183 | 0.164 | yes (and sig differs: ** vs ***) |

**Fix**
- Again: your **N is drastically different** (283 vs 503), and political intolerance has **massive missingness** in your data (402 missing among music-complete). That alone will change standardized coefficients and p-values.
- Also check **income_pc construction**: your income effect collapses from -0.054 to -0.009 in the true table; that kind of change often reflects either:
  - different sample,
  - different income measure (household vs per-capita vs logged),
  - top-coding / imputation differences,
  - or weighting.

## 3) Mismatches in constants and fit statistics

### Constants
- Model 1: Generated **10.848** vs True **10.920** (mismatch)
- Model 2: Generated **9.868** vs True **8.507** (large mismatch)
- Model 3: Generated **7.689** vs True **6.516** (large mismatch)

**Fix**
- If predictors are standardized but the DV is **not** standardized (as here), constants depend heavily on the **sample mean of the DV** and the exact estimation sample.
- So to match constants you must match:
  1) the **exact same sample selection**,
  2) any **weights**,
  3) any **coding/recoding** that affects inclusion.

### R² / Adjusted R²
- Model 1: Generated R² **0.097** vs True **0.107**
- Model 2: Generated R² **0.150** vs True **0.151** (close)
- Model 3: Generated R² **0.146** vs True **0.169** (large mismatch)
- Adjusted R² also differs similarly.

**Fix**
- Primarily sample mismatch (especially Model 3).
- Secondarily: if the PDF used **weighted OLS** or a different handling of missingness, R² changes.

---

## 4) Mismatches in sample sizes (this is the clearest “hard” discrepancy)

True N vs Generated N:
- **Model 1:** True **787** vs Generated **748**
- **Model 2:** True **756** vs Generated **503**
- **Model 3:** True **503** vs Generated **283**

These are not small differences—Models 2 and 3 are completely different analytic samples.

**Fix (most important steps)**
1) Reproduce the PDF’s **missing-data rule**. Your outputs show strict **listwise deletion** on all included variables. The PDF’s Ns imply either:
   - they used **different variable missingness** (e.g., their “hispanic” variable is not missing for 298 cases like yours), and/or
   - they used **a different base sample** than your `N_complete_music_18 = 893`, and/or
   - they used **imputation/recoding** (e.g., treating missing religion/race as a category), and/or
   - they used a different year/subset filter.
2) Specifically, your `hispanic` variable is missing for **298** cases, which alone drives Model 2 down to 503. In the true table, Model 2 has **756** cases, meaning **hispanic cannot be missing for ~40% of cases** in the true workflow.
   - Very likely explanation: in the original study/PDF, “Hispanic” was coded **0/1 with missing recoded to 0** or derived from another variable with far less missingness.
3) Your `political_intolerance` is missing for **402** cases (out of 893 music-complete), collapsing Model 3 to 283; the true table has 503.
   - This suggests you are either using the wrong intolerance variable, or you constructed it requiring multiple items and you’re dropping if any item missing, whereas the PDF likely used a more permissive rule (e.g., mean of available items, or fewer component items).

---

## 5) Significance/interpretation mismatches

Because your coefficients and especially **N** differ, your p-values/stars don’t align with the true table.

Examples:
- Model 3 `educ`: Generated `*` (p≈.025) but True is `**`.
- Model 3 `political_intolerance`: Generated `**` but True is `***`.
- Model 2 `southern`: Generated nonsig (p≈.129) but True is `**`.
- Model 2 `age`: Generated `*` but True is `***`.

**Fix**
- You cannot “patch” stars; you must match **the same estimation** (same sample, coding, weights). Once that matches, significance will fall into place.

---

## 6) Variable name mismatches (minor, but still discrepancies)

The **conceptual variables** match, but the labeling differs:
- True table uses prose labels (“Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”).
- Generated uses dataset-style names (`income_pc`, `prestg80`).

**Fix**
- Relabel variables in the output table to exactly match the PDF labels.
- Also ensure “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” are defined identically (denomination coding is often a source of mismatch even if the name matches).

# What you should do to make the generated analysis match the true Table 1

Priority order:

1) **Reproduce the analytic Ns (787, 756, 503).**  
   - Fix missingness in `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` (likely wrong construction or overly strict listwise deletion across items).
   - Confirm you’re using the same year/sample restrictions as the PDF.

2) **Match variable construction/coding.**
   - Ensure race/ethnicity categories are mutually exclusive and use the same reference group as the PDF.
   - Confirm income is truly “household income per capita” and treated the same way (no log unless PDF did).
   - Confirm political intolerance scale construction matches the original (items, scaling, missing handling).

3) **Use the same standardization rule.**
   - Standardize using the same sample the PDF used for each model (likely within-model estimation sample).

4) **Do not report SEs in “Table 1” if the PDF table does not.**
   - Or present them in a separate table clearly labeled as your own re-estimation output.

If you tell me (a) the dataset/source, (b) how `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` were constructed, and (c) whether weights were used in the PDF, I can point to the most likely exact cause of the N collapse and the coefficient shifts.
