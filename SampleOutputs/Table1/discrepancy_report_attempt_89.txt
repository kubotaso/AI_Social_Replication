============================================================

Below is a variable-by-variable and model-by-model audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True (paper/Table 1) results**, covering **variable names/presence, coefficients (β), N, R²/Adj R², and interpretation/significance**—plus concrete fixes so the generated output reproduces Table 1.

---

## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (N, R², Adj R²)

### Model 1 (SES)
**Generated:** n=747, R²=0.088, Adj R²=0.085  
**True:** n=787, R²=0.107, Adj R²=0.104  
**Mismatch:** All three differ substantially.

**How to fix**
- Your estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s by **40 cases**. This is almost certainly due to **listwise deletion** + different handling of missing values and/or different construction of the dependent variable.
- Ensure the dependent variable and predictors are coded exactly like the paper and then **restrict to the same universe** as the paper (GSS 1993 + the valid responses used to form “# genres disliked”).
- Recreate the Table 1 models using the paper’s sample rule, not “complete cases on whatever variables happen to be in the dataframe.”

### Model 2 (Demographic)
**Generated:** n=745, R²=0.125, Adj R²=0.111  
**True:** n=756, R²=0.151, Adj R²=0.139  
**Mismatch:** n is **11 lower**, R²/Adj R² too low.

**How to fix**
- Same issue: estimation sample differs (likely missingness handling and/or different recodes for race/region/religion).
- Verify all dummy variables are coded with the same reference categories as the paper and that missing categories aren’t inadvertently turned into NA (or vice versa).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
**Generated:** n=491, R²=0.140, Adj R²=0.120; “dropped_predictors: hispanic”  
**True:** n=503, R²=0.169, Adj R²=0.148; **Hispanic is included** with β=0.031  
**Mismatch:** n is **12 lower**, R²/Adj R² too low, and you *lost a predictor entirely*.

**How to fix**
- The “dropped_predictors: hispanic” + NA coefficient indicates a modeling failure (see Section 2C). Fix the Hispanic variable coding so it varies in the estimation sample and is not perfectly collinear.
- Align sample construction: the paper has **503** observations; you have **491** (and also a broken predictor).

## 2) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model

Important: the paper reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (and unstandardized constants). Your “Table1_style” uses **beta_std**, which is correct in principle—but many β values don’t match.

### A) Model 1 (SES): β and constant mismatches
Paper (True β):  
- Education: **-0.322***  
- Income pc: **-0.037**  
- Prestige: **0.016**  
- Constant: **10.920**

Generated (Table1_style β):  
- Education: **-0.292*** (too small in magnitude)  
- Income pc: **-0.039** (close)  
- Prestige: **0.020** (slightly high)  
- Constant: **10.638** (too low)

**How to fix**
1. **Match the sample (N=787)** (this alone can move coefficients materially).
2. Confirm the **dependent variable construction** (“num_genres_disliked”). Your missingness table shows **44% missing** on the DV, which is extremely high; if the paper’s DV was constructed from multiple genre items, you may be:
   - treating “don’t know / not asked” as missing when the paper treated them differently, or
   - using a different set of genre items, or
   - coding “dislike” differently.
3. Ensure β are computed like the paper: standardized coefficients from OLS. In practice:
   - either run OLS on **z-scored X and z-scored Y** (intercept typically ~0 then), *or*
   - compute β from unstandardized b via: **β = b * SD(X)/SD(Y)** using the **same estimation sample**.
   If your SDs are computed on a different sample than the regression (e.g., before listwise deletion), β will not match.

### B) Model 2 (Demographic): multiple β mismatches + Southern significance mismatch
Paper (True β):
- Education -0.246***
- Income -0.054
- Prestige -0.006
- Female -0.083*
- Age 0.140***
- Black 0.029
- Hispanic -0.029
- Other race 0.005
- Cons Prot 0.059
- No religion -0.012
- Southern 0.097**  
- Constant 8.507

Generated (Table1_style β):
- Education **-0.229*** (too small magnitude)
- Income **-0.055** (close)
- Prestige **0.002** (wrong sign; should be negative)
- Female **-0.086***? (star matches *; magnitude close)
- Age **0.125*** (too small)
- Black **0.022** (too small)
- Hispanic **-0.026** (close)
- Other race **-0.010** (wrong sign)
- Cons Prot **0.092*** (too large; also star differs—paper has no star shown)
- No religion **-0.002** (too close to 0; paper -0.012)
- Southern **0.062** (too small and **missing the paper’s ** significance**)
- Constant **8.490** (close)

**How to fix**
1. **Sample alignment (N=756)**.
2. **Dummy coding/reference categories**
   - If the paper used a particular baseline category (e.g., White as reference with Black/Hispanic/Other dummies), confirm you did the same.
   - For religion and region, confirm “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” are coded exactly as in the paper (often based on denomination recodes; small recoding differences strongly affect coefficients).
3. **Southern**: your estimate is smaller and not significant; paper shows **0.097** with ** (p<.01). This is a strong sign your:
   - south variable definition differs (Census South vs something else),
   - or your model uses different weights/sample.
4. **Weights**: GSS analyses often use weights (e.g., WTSSALL or year-specific). If the paper used weights and you did not (or vice versa), that can shift coefficients and significance. Check the paper’s methods and replicate weighting.

### C) Model 3 (Political intolerance): major problems (Hispanic dropped; many β off; significance off)
Paper (True β):
- Education -0.151**
- Income -0.009
- Prestige -0.022
- Female -0.095*
- Age 0.110*
- Black 0.049
- Hispanic 0.031
- Other race 0.053
- Cons Prot 0.066
- No religion 0.024
- Southern 0.121**
- Political intolerance 0.164***
- Constant 6.516
- N=503, R²=0.169

Generated (Table1_style β):
- Education **-0.123***? (you mark *, but magnitude is too small; significance differs)
- Income **-0.036** (far too negative; should be near 0 at -0.009)
- Prestige **0.003** (wrong sign; should be negative)
- Female **-0.099*** (close)
- Age **0.082** (too small; paper says significant *)
- Black **0.050** (close)
- Hispanic **(blank/NA)** (should be 0.031)
- Other race **0.060** (close)
- Cons Prot **0.093*** (too large)
- No religion **0.034** (close-ish)
- Southern **0.066** (much too small; paper 0.121**)
- Political intolerance **0.194*** (too large; paper 0.164***)
- Constant **6.290** (too low)

**How to fix**
1. **Fix “Hispanic” being dropped**
   - This happens when the variable is **constant in the estimation sample**, perfectly predicts missingness, or is **collinear** with other included race dummies (e.g., if you included all race categories with no reference group).
   - Ensure race is coded with **one omitted reference category** (typically White omitted), e.g. include Black, Hispanic, Other, and omit White.
   - Confirm “hispanic” is not accidentally coded as all 0/1 after filtering (e.g., if your political intolerance nonmissing subsample happens to exclude Hispanics due to a merge/recode error).
2. **Reconcile political intolerance scale**
   - Paper: “Political intolerance (0–15)”. If your `pol_intol` is constructed differently (different items, different handling of DK/NA, different scaling), β will shift and N will change.
   - Ensure the scale is exactly **0–15**, same item set, same rules for missing items (sum vs mean, minimum answered items, etc.).
3. **Income coefficient is wildly off**
   - Generated β income is -0.036 vs true -0.009. That points to either:
     - different income variable (inc_pc) construction/units,
     - outlier handling differences,
     - or standardization mismatch (SDs computed on different sample).
4. **Southern and Age effects too small**
   - Again suggests sample/weighting mismatch or recoding differences.

## 3) Standard errors: not comparable / incorrectly framed

**True Table 1:** SEs are **not reported**.  
**Generated Results:** you report `p_replication` and stars; SEs are not shown either, but you are effectively treating p-values as if they can be directly compared to the paper’s stars.

**Mismatch (interpretation)**
- You cannot claim your “sig” matches the paper unless:
  - you use the same SE estimator (OLS classical vs robust),
  - same weighting,
  - same sample,
  - and same two-tailed thresholds.
- The paper’s stars are based on *its* p-values; yours come from your (currently mismatched) model.

**How to fix**
- Don’t compare SEs to Table 1 (they’re absent). Compare **β and stars only**, after you replicate sample/variables/weights.
- Once replicated, compute p-values using the same assumptions (usually classical OLS) and apply the paper’s thresholds (*, **, ***).

---

## 4) Variable naming/presence mismatches

### Hispanic labeling inconsistency
- Generated tables use **“Hispanic”** (capitalized) in model2, but model3 has **Hispanic = NA** and fit_stats says “dropped_predictors hispanic” (lowercase).
- This indicates your pipeline is mixing label strings and raw variable names and dropping based on the raw name.

**How to fix**
- Standardize internal names (e.g., `hispanic`) and separately store display labels (“Hispanic”).
- Add a hard check: if any coefficient is NA due to dropping, **fail the run** and report why (collinearity/zero variance).

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Notable star mismatches relative to the paper:
- **Model 2 Southern**: Generated no star; True has ** (p<.01).
- **Model 3 Age**: Generated no star; True has *.
- **Model 2 Conservative Protestant**: Generated *; True shows no star (β=0.059, likely ns).

**How to fix**
- After correcting sample/weights/recodes, recompute p-values and apply cutoffs.
- If still off, check whether the paper used **one-tailed** tests (unlikely given note says two-tailed), or different SEs/weights.

---

## 6) Concrete replication checklist (to make generated match “True”)

1. **Rebuild the dependent variable** exactly as in the paper (items included, coding of dislike, treatment of DK/NA/not asked).
2. **Rebuild `pol_intol`** to match 0–15 exactly and apply identical missing-data rules.
3. **Use the same year/sample restriction** (GSS 1993; confirm any additional exclusions).
4. **Apply the same weight** (if the paper used one).
5. **Use listwise deletion per model** but ensure it matches the paper’s N (787 / 756 / 503).
6. **Race coding**: include dummies Black/Hispanic/Other with **White omitted**; verify no collinearity and that Hispanics exist in Model 3 sample.
7. **Compute standardized coefficients β correctly on the estimation sample** (either z-score method or SD conversion, but consistent).
8. Only then compare β and significance stars to Table 1.

If you share (a) the code that constructs `num_genres_disliked` and `pol_intol`, and (b) the exact regression code (including weights and NA handling), I can point to the specific lines causing the N loss and the “Hispanic dropped” failure and propose exact corrected code.
