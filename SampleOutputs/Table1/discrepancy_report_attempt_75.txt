Score: 40/100
============================================================

Below is a complete mismatch audit between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1 as printed)**, plus concrete fixes so the generated output can be made to match the printed table.

---

## 1) Sample size (N) mismatches (major)

### What’s wrong
Generated listwise Ns are far smaller:

- Model 1: **748** (generated) vs **787** (true)
- Model 2: **482** (generated) vs **756** (true)
- Model 3: **272** (generated) vs **503** (true)

This is not a small discrepancy; it guarantees coefficient/R² differences and changes in significance.

### Why it happened (from your diagnostics)
Your “dv_rule” says:

> “strict complete-case across all 18 music items; dislike=4/5; sum to 0–18”

That forces respondents to have **no missing on all 18 genre items**, which will drop many cases. The printed table clearly did not enforce that strict rule (or used a different item set / missing-data handling).

Also Model 2 drops to 482 largely because `hispanic` has **298 missing** in your construction; the printed model obviously retained far more cases, implying the Hispanic indicator was not set to missing for those 298.

### How to fix
To match the printed N’s you need to replicate *their* case rules:

1) **Rebuild DV with the same missing rule used in the article/PDF**  
   Likely options (common in published indices):
   - **Allow partial completion**: compute “genres disliked” from available items and (a) use a count of disliked among nonmissing items, possibly (b) rescale to 0–18.
   - **Use fewer than 18 items** (if Table 1 was based on a subset).
   - **Treat some nonresponse codes as “not disliked”** (less likely, but sometimes done).

   Practical implementation approach:
   - Inspect the PDF methods/appendix for the exact DV construction.
   - If not available, reverse engineer: adjust DV missing rule until N for Model 1 becomes **787** when using only SES predictors.

2) **Fix Hispanic variable construction so it’s not missing for 298 people**  
   Your rule:
   > “ETHNIC==1 if ETHNIC present; otherwise missing”

   That’s almost certainly wrong for matching Table 1. In many surveys, if ETHNIC is missing, you **still can keep the person** by coding Hispanic = 0 when race indicates non-Hispanic, or by using a combined race/ethnicity variable that is complete.

   Concretely:
   - If the dataset has a single race/ethnicity classification used by the paper, use that (e.g., a mutually exclusive “Black/Hispanic/White/Other”).
   - If you must derive:
     - `hispanic = 1` if respondent marked Hispanic
     - `hispanic = 0` otherwise **including when ETHNIC missing but other info indicates not Hispanic**, and only set missing when truly indeterminate per the paper.

3) **Don’t impose “strict complete-case across 15 intolerance items” unless the paper did**  
   Your polintol rule is also strict and shrinks to 503 → 272. To match **503**, you must build the political intolerance index with the same missing handling used in the printed results.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (variable-by-variable)

All comparisons below are **standardized betas**, since Table 1 prints standardized coefficients.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.310*** | **-0.322*** | value off |
| Income pc | **-0.038** | **-0.037** | close, slightly off |
| Prestige | **0.025** | **0.016** | value off |
| R² | **0.097** | **0.107** | off |
| Adj R² | **0.094** | **0.104** | off |
| N | **748** | **787** | off |

**Fix:** once N/DV construction matches, these will move. If they still don’t match, then you’re not using the same:
- standardization procedure (see Section 4),
- weights,
- year restriction,
- or exact variable coding (education scale, prestige variable version).

### Model 2 (Demographic)

Key coefficient mismatches:

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.287*** | -0.246*** | **large** |
| Female | -0.087* | -0.083* | close |
| Age | 0.095* | 0.140*** | **large + significance** |
| Black | 0.120 | 0.029 | **large** |
| Hispanic | -0.085 | -0.029 | medium |
| Other race | -0.012 | 0.005 | sign differs |
| Cons Prot | 0.076 | 0.059 | small |
| No religion | -0.022 | -0.012 | small |
| Southern | 0.068 | 0.097** | **value + significance** |
| R² | 0.152 | 0.151 | close |
| Adj R² | 0.132 | 0.139 | off |
| N | 482 | 756 | **huge** |

**Fix:** again, the overwhelming driver is sample definition and missingness in `hispanic` (and likely DV strictness). But the **Black coefficient** being so different also suggests you may be using **different reference coding** for race/ethnicity than the paper (e.g., including Hispanic as a race vs separate ethnicity; or a different baseline group).

To match Table 1 you need the *same race/ethnicity scheme* as the authors:
- Their table includes **Black, Hispanic, Other race** (implying omitted/reference is likely **White non-Hispanic**).
- Your construction must recreate that exact scheme with minimal missingness.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.156* | -0.151** | sig level differs |
| Income pc | -0.056 | -0.009 | **large** |
| Female | -0.130* | -0.095* | moderate |
| Age | 0.088 | 0.110* | significance differs |
| Southern | 0.068 | 0.121** | **large** |
| Political intolerance | 0.155* | 0.164*** | sig level differs |
| R² | 0.147 | 0.169 | off |
| Adj R² | 0.107 | 0.148 | off |
| N | 272 | 503 | **huge** |

**Fix:** political intolerance scale construction and its missing rule must change (you’re dropping ~46% of the eligible cases). Once N matches, standard errors shrink and significance will increase—this alone can explain why you get `*` while the table shows `***` for political intolerance.

## 3) Standard errors: generated table prints SEs but the true table does not

### What’s wrong
Your `table1_style` prints a second line under each coefficient that looks like standard errors. But the “True Results” explicitly states:

> Table 1 reports standardized coefficients only and does not print standard errors.

So **any** SE comparison is impossible, and your output format does not match the printed table.

### How to fix
- Remove SE rows from the table output if your goal is to match the PDF.
- Or, if you must show SEs, label them clearly as “computed SEs (not shown in Table 1)” and don’t claim they match.

---

## 4) Standardization / weighting mismatch (likely)

### What’s wrong
Your diagnostics say:

> “standardize DV and predictors within each model estimation sample (weighted if weights present); run OLS/WLS”

The printed table may have standardized:
- only predictors (not DV), or
- used unweighted standardization but weighted regression, or
- used survey weights in regression but **not** in computing z-scores, or
- used a different weight variable, or no weights.

Any of those will alter standardized betas.

### How to fix
Match the paper’s exact procedure:

1) Confirm whether analyses are **weighted** (and which weight).
2) Confirm whether betas are:
   - `lm(scale(y) ~ scale(x))` style (DV and X standardized), **or**
   - post-hoc standardized using unstandardized b’s and SDs, **or**
   - “beta weights” from a package that does something slightly different.

Then implement that exact approach. If the PDF is silent, you can often infer it by checking whether the constant is reported (they report constants like 10.920). Reporting a constant alongside “standardized coefficients” is a hint they may have standardized **X only**, not Y (because if Y is standardized the intercept would be ~0). That’s important:

- Your generated output does **not** show an intercept in the coefficient table.
- The true table shows a **nonzero constant** in all models.

### Concrete fix for intercept issue
Recreate their setup:

- Run regression on **unstandardized DV**.
- Standardize predictors only (z-scores), leave DV in original metric.
- Then coefficients correspond to “change in DV units per 1 SD of X” (often still called “standardized” in social science tables).
- That also preserves a meaningful intercept (expected DV at mean of predictors if centered).

If you instead standardized Y too, the intercept would be ~0 and you wouldn’t match their constants.

---

## 5) Intercept/constant reporting mismatch

### What’s wrong
True table includes constants:
- 10.920; 8.507; 6.516

Generated table omits the constant entirely.

### How to fix
- Include the intercept in `table1_style`.
- More importantly, ensure you haven’t standardized DV in a way that forces the intercept to ~0 (see Section 4).

---

## 6) Significance stars mismatches (interpretation)

These are not just “format” differences; your stars differ because your p-values differ, mainly due to N/missing rules and possibly weighting/standardization.

Examples:
- Education Model 3: generated `*`, true `**`
- Age Model 2: generated `*`, true `***`
- Southern Model 2: generated none, true `**`
- Political intolerance: generated `*`, true `***`

### How to fix
Once you replicate:
1) identical sample,
2) identical DV/polintol construction,
3) identical weighting,
4) identical standardization strategy,

the p-values (and thus stars) should align closely.

---

## 7) Variable name mismatches (minor but real)

The true table uses labels; your internal names are fine but you must map them correctly.

Potential issues to verify:
- `prestg80` matches “Occupational prestige” (same scale/version? 1980 prestige score is common, but there are multiple prestige measures).
- `income_pc` is “Household income per capita” — you used `REALINC/HOMPOP`; confirm the paper’s numerator/denominator and top/bottom coding rules.
- `political_intolerance` index: confirm item count (you used 15) and coding direction.

### How to fix
Create an explicit dictionary mapping internal variable names to Table-1 labels, and confirm you used the same underlying source variables and coding choices as the authors.

---

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1) **Reproduce the exact DV construction** used in the paper (items, thresholds, missing handling).  
2) **Reproduce race/ethnicity coding** so Hispanic is not missing for 298 cases and reference group matches “White (omitted)”.  
3) **Reproduce political intolerance index** (items, scoring, missing handling) so Model 3 N becomes ~503.  
4) **Match standardization approach** (very likely: standardize X’s only; keep DV unstandardized) so constants match.  
5) **Match weighting and estimation** (OLS vs WLS, survey design if any).  
6) **Change table output**: remove SEs (since Table 1 doesn’t print them) and include the intercept.

If you share (a) the PDF methods text describing variable construction and (b) the code you used to build DV, Hispanic, and political intolerance, I can point to the exact lines that must change to hit the printed Ns and coefficients.
