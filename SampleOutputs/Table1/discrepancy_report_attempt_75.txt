============================================================

Below is every discrepancy between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, grouped by (A) fit/sample, (B) variables/names, (C) coefficients & significance, and (D) interpretation/reporting. For each, I state how to fix it so the generated analysis matches the published table.

---

## A) Sample size and fit statistics mismatches (major)

### 1) **N differs in every model**
- **Model 1:** Generated **n=747** vs True **n=787**
- **Model 2:** Generated **n=507** vs True **n=756**
- **Model 3:** Generated **n=286** vs True **n=503**

**Why it happened (likely):**
- Your pipeline appears to be doing **listwise deletion** using *more variables than are in the published models*, or it is using a different missing-data rule than the paper.
- In particular, the **hispanic** variable shows extreme missingness in your summary (35%), and **pol_intol** has 47% missingness. If you listwise-delete on those, N collapses (as you see in Models 2–3).

**How to fix:**
- Recreate the paper’s **exact sample restrictions** (GSS 1993, valid responses) and **exact missing-data handling**.
- Ensure Model 1 is estimated **only on cases nonmissing on: educ_yrs, inc_pc, prestg80_v, num_genres_disliked** (and nothing else).
- Ensure Model 2 is estimated only on cases nonmissing on Model 2 predictors + DV (not on Model 3 predictors).
- Ensure Model 3 is estimated only on cases nonmissing on Model 3 predictors + DV.

Concretely: don’t compute a “master analysis dataset” with all variables and then run all models on it. Build the estimation dataset *per model*.

### 2) **R² and adjusted R² do not match**
- **Model 1:** Generated R² **0.088** vs True **0.107**
- **Model 2:** Generated R² **0.135** vs True **0.151**
- **Model 3:** Generated R² **0.145** vs True **0.169**
(and adjusted R² are off as well)

**Why it happened:**
- Different **N** alone will change R² somewhat, but the gaps are large, especially for Model 3.
- Also, your models are likely not coded identically (see “Other race dropped” and the “Hispanic” coding issue below).

**How to fix:**
- Fix sample construction (above).
- Fix predictor coding (especially race dummies) so coefficients are comparable.
- Re-run OLS after matching variable definitions.

---

## B) Variable name/coding mismatches

### 3) **“Other race” is dropped (NaN) in Models 2–3, but exists in the paper**
- Generated shows `Other race = NaN` and `dropped_predictors = otherrace`
- True table reports **Other race β = 0.005 (M2)** and **β = 0.053 (M3)**

**Why it happened:**
- In your model2/model3 sample profiles, `otherrace mean = 0.000, sd = 0.000` → it’s **constant** in the estimation sample (no variation), so software drops it.
- That implies your recode or filtering produced **zero “other race” cases** after listwise deletion or misclassification.

**How to fix:**
- Fix race coding and/or missingness handling so “other race” respondents remain in the sample.
- Verify race dummies are mutually exclusive and correctly coded from the original GSS race/ethnicity items.
- After building the correct model-specific dataset, check `table(otherrace)` (must include some 1s).

---

### 4) **Hispanic variable is clearly miscoded (near-constant 0/1 problem)**
- Generated model2 sample profile: `hispanic mean = 0.917` (so ~92% are coded “Hispanic”)
- In GSS 1993, the share Hispanic should be nowhere near that; in the paper, “Hispanic” is a minority dummy with a modest coefficient.

**Why it happened:**
- You likely coded `hispanic = 1` for **non-Hispanic** (inverted), or you accidentally used a “not Hispanic” indicator, or you recoded missing as 1.

**How to fix:**
- Recode Hispanic correctly: `hispanic = 1` if respondent is Hispanic, else 0.
- Confirm using frequency checks against known GSS distributions.
- Once fixed, Model 2/3 coefficients for Hispanic should move toward the paper’s signs/magnitudes (Model 2 true β is **-0.029**, Model 3 true β is **0.031**).

---

### 5) **Outcome variable naming mismatch is fine, but ensure definition matches**
- Generated DV: `num_genres_disliked`
- True DV: “Number of music genres disliked”

**Potential hidden mismatch:**
- The paper may have defined DV from specific genre items with specific “dislike” thresholds and handling of DK/NA.

**How to fix:**
- Verify you constructed the DV identically to the paper (same genre list, same coding for dislike, same handling of missing).

---

## C) Coefficients, SEs, and significance mismatches (by model)

### Critical meta-issue: you are comparing *your computed OLS output* to a table that reports **standardized coefficients (β) only**, with **no SEs reported**.
- In your “model*_full” you report **unstandardized b**, **standardized beta**, **p-values**, and stars.
- The paper’s table is **β with stars**, and constants are unstandardized.

That’s okay *if* your “Table1style” column is intended to reproduce the paper. But even there, many betas don’t match.

---

## Model 1 mismatches (SES model)

### 6) Constant is off
- Generated constant (unstandardized): **10.638**
- True constant: **10.920**

**Fix:** After sample and DV construction are corrected, re-estimate; constants will change.

### 7) Education β mismatch
- Generated β: **-0.292***  
- True β: **-0.322***  

**Fix:** sample alignment + correct variable scaling/coding. If you standardized differently (e.g., using sample SD from a different N), that will also shift β. Use the same estimation sample for standardization.

### 8) Income β close but not identical
- Generated β: **-0.039** vs True β: **-0.037**

**Fix:** likely sample differences; should align after N/coding fixes.

### 9) Prestige β mismatch
- Generated β: **0.020** vs True β: **0.016**

**Fix:** again likely sample/measure mismatch (prestige scale, missing handling).

---

## Model 2 mismatches (Demographic model)

### 10) Constant mismatch
- Generated: **9.285** vs True: **8.507**

**Fix:** sample/coding alignment.

### 11) Education β mismatch
- Generated: **-0.264*** vs True: **-0.246*** (direction same)

**Fix:** sample/coding alignment.

### 12) Age β mismatch (and significance level mismatch)
- Generated β: **0.104***? (actually your table shows `0.104*` with p=0.0176)
- True β: **0.140***  

So both **magnitude and stars** are wrong.

**Fix:** sample alignment and correct coding (age should be continuous years; ensure no rescaling/centering). Also the very small N (507 vs 756) is likely inflating SEs/reducing significance.

### 13) Southern effect mismatch (both size and significance)
- Generated β: **0.063**, p=0.15 (ns)
- True β: **0.097** with ** (p < .01)

**Fix:** sample alignment and correct region coding. Also confirm South is coded the same as in paper (often GSS “region” coding; ensure you didn’t use a different south definition).

### 14) Race coefficients don’t match; Hispanic sign mismatch
- Black:
  - Generated β **0.043**, p=0.87 (nonsense level of insignificance given β size; suggests huge SE from coding issues)
  - True β **0.029** (ns)
- Hispanic:
  - Generated β **+0.030**
  - True β **-0.029**

**Fix:** Hispanic coding is likely inverted/miscoded (see section B4). Fix that first; then re-run.

### 15) “Other race” missing entirely (already covered)
- Generated: blank/NaN
- True: β **0.005**

**Fix:** keep variation in otherrace via correct recode and not wiping them out via listwise deletion.

### 16) Religion coefficients differ somewhat; Conservative Protestant significance mismatch
- Generated Conservative Protestant β **0.090**, p=0.053 (ns/just above .05)
- True β **0.059** (ns, no stars)

This one is not catastrophic, but indicates model mismatch.

**Fix:** sample/coding alignment for cons_prot and norelig; confirm reference category is the same as paper.

---

## Model 3 mismatches (Political intolerance model)

### 17) Constant mismatch
- Generated: **7.360** vs True: **6.516**

**Fix:** sample/coding alignment.

### 18) Political intolerance β mismatch and star mismatch
- Generated β: **0.190** with ** (p=0.00265)
- True β: **0.164*** (p < .001)

Both magnitude and significance don’t match.

**Fix:** correct sample (N should be 503 not 286), correct pol_intol construction, and confirm the scale is identical (0–15 matches, but item composition/handling of DK may differ).

### 19) Age β mismatch and significance mismatch
- Generated β: **0.083** (ns, p=0.16)
- True β: **0.110***? (True table shows `0.110*`)

**Fix:** sample size and coding.

### 20) Prestige β mismatch (sign and size)
- Generated β: **-0.011**
- True β: **-0.022**

**Fix:** sample/coding alignment.

### 21) Southern β mismatch (and significance)
- Generated β: **0.065** (ns)
- True β: **0.121** with **

**Fix:** sample and south coding.

### 22) “Other race” missing entirely (already covered)
- Generated: dropped
- True: β **0.053**

---

## D) Standard errors and interpretation/reporting problems

### 23) You report SEs implicitly via p-values, but Table 1 has no SEs
- True Results explicitly: **SE not reported**
- Generated results present p-values and significance as if you can validate them against the paper’s table.

**Fix (reporting):**
- If the goal is to match the paper’s Table 1, your reproduction output should show:
  - standardized β (not b)
  - constants unstandardized
  - stars only (no p-values/SE comparisons to Table 1)
- If you still want SEs for your own regression, keep them, but don’t claim they mismatch the paper unless the paper reports them.

### 24) Interpretation risk: mixing b and β
Your “model*_full” shows both `b` and `beta`, but your “Table1style” uses **beta** for predictors and **unstandardized constant**, which is correct *in principle*.

**Fix:**
- Ensure the Table1style column is **exactly the standardized β**, rounded the same way as the paper, with the same star thresholds.
- Verify whether the paper used **two-tailed** tests (it says it did) and the same p-cutoffs.

## Summary of the key fixes to make generated match true

1) **Fix Hispanic coding** (it is almost certainly inverted or otherwise wrong).
2) **Do model-specific listwise deletion** (don’t let pol_intol missingness shrink Model 2; don’t let demographic missingness shrink Model 1).
3) **Ensure “Other race” has variation** by correct race recoding and by not dropping those cases unnecessarily.
4) **Match variable constructions** to the paper:
   - DV construction (“genres disliked”)
   - inc_pc computation
   - prestige scale (prestg80_v)
   - south definition
   - pol_intol index construction
5) **Standardize using the estimation sample** for each model (to match βs).
6) **Report like the paper**: β + stars; don’t treat SE/p-values as “mismatching” unless the paper provides them.

If you share the code (or at least the recode steps for race/ethnicity, DV, and pol_intol), I can point to the exact lines that are producing the Hispanic/Other-race/sample-size failures and specify corrected recodes.
