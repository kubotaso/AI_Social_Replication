## 1) Fit statistics: mismatches and fixes

### N (number of cases)
- **Model 1**
  - Generated: **758**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your Model 1 estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s. Align the case-selection rules to the paper:
    - Use the same survey year/waves as the authors.
    - Use the same handling of missingness (likely listwise deletion on the *model’s* predictors and DV, not extra exclusions).
    - Ensure you did **not** accidentally require nonmissingness on variables not in Model 1 (e.g., demographics/polintol).

- **Model 2**
  - Generated: **523**
  - True: **756**
  - **Fix:** This is a major discrepancy. It strongly suggests you are (a) mistakenly restricting to the political intolerance subsample, or (b) using an overly strict “complete across all items” rule, or (c) dropping many cases via factor-coding/NA creation (e.g., race/religion recodes).
  - Concrete checks:
    - Confirm Model 2 is fit on DV complete + Model 2 predictors only.
    - Ensure race categories don’t create NAs (e.g., “DK/refused/other” becoming NA instead of a category/exclusion consistent with paper).
    - Ensure you aren’t merging datasets and losing rows.

- **Model 3**
  - Generated: **343**
  - True: **503**
  - **Fix:** Same issue as above plus political intolerance construction. You likely required stricter completeness than the authors (e.g., strict completion of 15 items).
  - The “true” table suggests the authors keep substantially more cases than your **n_polintol_complete15_strict = 491** would already allow, so your regression N=343 implies additional unintended dropping (e.g., due to income/prestige missingness, recode NA, weights, or filtering).

### R² and Adjusted R²
- **Model 1**
  - Generated R² **0.1088**, True **0.107** (close)
  - Generated Adj R² **0.1052**, True **0.104** (close)
  - **Fix:** Once N and exact standardization/coding match, these should match very closely.

- **Model 2**
  - Generated R² **0.1573**, True **0.151** (noticeable)
  - Adj R² **0.1391** equals True **0.139** (oddly close despite N mismatch)
  - **Fix:** With the correct N and coding, R² should land near 0.151. The current R² is inflated/shifted because you are analyzing a different subset.

- **Model 3**
  - Generated R² **0.1488**, True **0.169** (substantial mismatch)
  - Generated Adj R² **0.1179**, True **0.148**
  - **Fix:** This is consistent with using the wrong sample and/or measuring `polintol` differently (or standardizing differently). Correct sample + correct polintol scale + correct coding should raise R² toward 0.169.

### Constant (intercept)
- **Model 1**
  - Generated **11.0857** vs True **10.920**
- **Model 2**
  - Generated **10.0887** vs True **8.507**
- **Model 3**
  - Generated **7.2760** vs True **6.516**
- **Fix:** Intercepts will differ if:
  1) DV coding differs (e.g., count construction),
  2) any predictors are centered/standardized differently,
  3) sample differs.
  
  Note: The paper reports **standardized coefficients** but also prints a **constant**; that implies they standardized X’s (and possibly Y) in a particular way or reported unstandardized constant with standardized betas (a common mixed presentation). To match: replicate their exact standardization convention (often: standardize predictors only, not the DV; betas computed as b * sd(x)/sd(y) while intercept is from the unstandardized regression).

## 2) Coefficient (beta) mismatches by variable and model

Below I compare **standardized coefficients** (the only thing Table 1 provides).

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.332*** | **-0.322*** | Too negative by ~0.010 |
| Household income per capita | -0.034 | -0.037 | Slight |
| Occupational prestige | **0.029** | **0.016** | Too positive by ~0.013 |

**Fixes (Model 1):**
- Ensure `prestg80` is coded/scaled identically (some prestige scales differ by transformation or handling of missing/“inapplicable”).
- Ensure your DV (“# music genres disliked”) is constructed exactly like the authors’ (same genre list, same dislike threshold, same treatment of “don’t know”).
- Align the estimation sample to N=787.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.302*** | **-0.246*** | Large (too negative) |
| Income per capita | -0.057 | -0.054 | Close |
| Occupational prestige | -0.007 | -0.006 | Close |
| Female | -0.078 (ns) | **-0.083*** | Significance differs; magnitude slightly off |
| Age | **0.109*** (only *) | **0.140*** | Too small; sig level differs |
| Black | 0.053 | 0.029 | Too large |
| Hispanic | -0.017 | -0.029 | Too small in magnitude |
| Other race | **-0.016** | **0.005** | **Sign is wrong** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.040 | 0.059 | Too small |
| No religion | -0.016 | -0.012 | Close |
| Southern | 0.079 (ns/.) | **0.097** ** | Too small; sig differs |

**Fixes (Model 2):**
1) **Sample**: Your N is 523 vs 756. That alone can flip signs (e.g., “other race”) and change magnitudes materially.
2) **Race coding**: “Other race” sign reversal strongly indicates you are not using the same reference categories or recode logic.
   - Confirm the paper’s reference group (likely White, non-Hispanic).
   - Ensure “Hispanic” is an ethnicity dummy that can overlap race *or* is mutually exclusive—papers differ. Your coding must match theirs.
3) **Age**: The paper’s age effect is larger (0.140***). Your smaller age beta suggests a different sample age distribution, different age coding (e.g., age categories), or different standardization.
4) **Education**: Big discrepancy (-0.302 vs -0.246) is consistent with analyzing a different subsample (your subset makes education “more predictive”).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157* | **-0.151** ** | similar magnitude, sig differs |
| Income per capita | **-0.074** | **-0.009** | **Huge mismatch** |
| Occupational prestige | 0.015 | **-0.022** | Sign differs |
| Female | **-0.117*** | **-0.095*** | Too negative |
| Age | 0.080 | **0.110*** | Too small; sig differs |
| Black | 0.065 | 0.049 | A bit high |
| Hispanic | 0.017 | 0.031 | low |
| Other race | 0.034 | 0.053 | low |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.002 | 0.066 | **Major mismatch** |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.078 | **0.121** ** | too small |
| Political intolerance | **0.207*** | **0.164*** | too large |

**Fixes (Model 3):**
- The **income per capita beta** mismatch (-0.074 vs -0.009) is the single biggest red flag: you are not reproducing the paper’s Model 3 specification/sample/measurement.
  - Most likely cause: **your Model 3 sample is heavily selected** (N=343 vs 503), making income strongly correlated with the DV in your subset.
  - Secondary cause: `inc_pc` may be computed differently (household size adjustment, inflation/year adjustment, top-coding).
- `conserv_prot` near zero in your results vs 0.066 in the paper: likely a **coding mismatch** (wrong definition of Conservative Protestant, wrong reference group, or mistakenly treating it as continuous/ordinal rather than dummy).
- Political intolerance beta too large (0.207 vs 0.164): likely **different polintol construction** (items, prorating rules, scaling) and/or sample restriction.

---

## 3) Variable name / labeling mismatches

### “Southern” vs `south`
- Names differ but concept likely same; no issue unless coding differs.
- **Fix:** Ensure `south` exactly equals the paper’s “Southern” dummy (state definitions, and whether “South” includes DC/MD/DE, etc., depending on convention used).

### “Household income per capita” vs `inc_pc`
- Name fine; construction likely not.
- **Fix:** Confirm:
  - per-capita = household income / household size (or equivalence scale?),
  - handling of missing household size/income,
  - top-coding and imputation rules.

### “Political intolerance” vs `polintol`
- Your notes show multiple counts (nonmissing prorated, strict complete15). The paper’s N=503 suggests a more permissive inclusion than your final regression.
- **Fix:** Recreate the paper’s polintol index exactly (same items, same response coding, same prorating/averaging rule, same missingness threshold).

---

## 4) Standard errors: interpretation mismatch

- Your “Generated Results” show **p-values and stars**, implying you computed SEs internally.
- The “True Results” explicitly states: **Table 1 does not print standard errors**.
- **Mismatch:** You cannot compare SEs to Table 1 because they are not provided. Any claim that your SEs “match” the table is impossible.
- **Fix:** When writing the comparison, restrict yourself to comparing:
  - standardized coefficients,
  - significance stars (imperfectly, because stars depend on SEs, but they *are* printed),
  - model fit stats (R², adj R², N, constant).
  If you want SE validation, you must obtain them from the authors’ replication files or re-run the same model on the same data and accept that Table 1 alone can’t validate SEs.

---

## 5) Significance/star mismatches (interpretation)

Even where betas are “close,” your **star levels** often differ from the paper (e.g., Education in Model 3 is * vs **; Age and South lose significance). That usually comes from:
- different N (power),
- different coding/measurement,
- different weighting/robust SEs assumptions.

**Fix:**
- Check whether the paper used **survey weights** and/or **robust (HC) standard errors**. Either can change p-values and stars without hugely changing betas.
- Match their inference method (OLS with conventional SEs vs robust vs survey design-based SEs).

---

## 6) Most likely root causes (in priority order)

1) **Wrong estimation samples per model** (your Ns are far off).
   - Implement model-wise listwise deletion only on that model’s variables.
2) **Different construction of `polintol`** (items/prorating), driving Model 3 differences.
3) **Different coding of race/ethnicity and religion (Conservative Protestant)** leading to sign flips and attenuated effects.
4) **Different income per capita definition**.
5) **Different standardization convention** for “standardized coefficients.”

---

## 7) What to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

A practical “make it match” checklist:

1) **Rebuild DV exactly**: “Number of music genres disliked”
   - Same set of genres, same response options counted as “disliked,” same missing handling.
2) **Per model, define the analytic dataset**:
   - Model 1: DV + educ + inc_pc + prestg80 (expect N=787)
   - Model 2: add demographics (expect N=756)
   - Model 3: add polintol (expect N=503)
3) **Recode predictors to match Table 1 definitions**:
   - Female dummy (1=female),
   - Race dummies with correct reference (likely White),
   - Hispanic treatment (mutually exclusive vs separate),
   - Conservative Protestant definition (denomination-based) and correct reference group,
   - Southern definition.
4) **Compute standardized coefficients the same way as the paper**:
   - Either standardize variables before OLS or compute betas from unstandardized b’s using SD ratios—do it the same way they did.
5) **Match inference**:
   - Use the same weighting/robustness approach as the authors; otherwise stars won’t line up.

If you want, paste (a) your variable coding/recode snippets and (b) how you computed `polintol` and `inc_pc`, and I can pinpoint exactly which step is causing the N collapse and the big Model 3 coefficient distortions.
