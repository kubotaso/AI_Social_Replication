============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of **every mismatch** between the *Generated Results* and the *True Results* (PDF Table 1), grouped into (A) variable-name/inclusion problems, (B) coefficient/significance mismatches, (C) sample size + fit-stat mismatches, (D) standard error/reporting problems, and (E) interpretation/measurement mismatches. For each, I state **how to fix the analysis so the generated output matches the printed table**.

---

## A) Variable names and variable inclusion mismatches

### A1) **Hispanic is missing entirely in the generated models**
- **True Results:** Hispanic appears in Model 2 and Model 3 (coefficients shown).
- **Generated Results:** Hispanic is omitted and a note says: *“Hispanic omitted: no usable Hispanic/ethnicity flag…”*

**Fix**
1. Identify the correct Hispanic/ethnicity variable in the dataset (common GSS-style names: `hispanic`, `hisp`, `ethnic`, `latino`, `ethnicity`, etc.).
2. Recode to match the PDF’s dummy:
   - `Hispanic = 1` if respondent is Hispanic/Latino, else `0`.
3. Include it in Model 2 and Model 3 exactly as in Table 1.

---

### A2) **Occupational prestige term name differs (prestg80 vs Occupational prestige)**
- **True Results:** “Occupational prestige”
- **Generated Results:** `prestg80`

This may be only a label mismatch, but it can also hide a **measurement mismatch** if the PDF used a different prestige scale/variable than `prestg80`.

**Fix**
- Confirm the PDF’s prestige variable definition. If it truly corresponds to `prestg80`, just relabel it in the table output as **Occupational prestige**.
- If the PDF used another prestige measure (e.g., `prestige`, `prestg10`, `sei`, etc.), swap in the correct variable and rerun.

---

### A3) Income variable naming/definition ambiguity
- **True Results:** “Household income per capita”
- **Generated Results:** `income_pc`

Label difference is fine **only if** the construction matches the article.

**Fix**
- Verify construction: `income_pc = household_income / household_size` (and any logged/standardized form).
- Ensure it is the same year-specific income measure and equivalence assumption used in the PDF.

---

## B) Coefficient and significance mismatches (by model)

All coefficients in the PDF are **standardized betas**. Your generated coefficients are also labeled `beta_std`, so we compare directly.

### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.322*** | -0.332*** | coefficient differs |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | coefficient differs (small) |
| Occ prestige | 0.016 | 0.029 | coefficient differs |
| Constant | 10.920 | 11.086 | constant differs |
| R² | 0.107 | 0.10877 | differs |
| Adj R² | 0.104 | 0.105224 | differs |
| N | 787 | 758 | **major mismatch** |

**Fix**
- The coefficient drift is very plausibly driven by the **wrong estimation sample** (see Section C). Get N to match first (787), then coefficients will move toward the printed ones.
- After fixing N, check standardization method (see Section E).

---

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.259*** | coefficient differs |
| HH income pc | -0.054 | -0.050 | coefficient differs |
| Occ prestige | -0.006 | 0.006 | **sign differs** |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.089** | coefficient & **sig** differ |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.129*** | coefficient differs |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.030 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | — | **omitted** |
| Other race | 0.005 | 0.001 | differs |
| Cons Prot | 0.059 | 0.067 | differs |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.004 | differs |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.084* | coefficient & **sig** differ |
| Constant | 8.507 | 8.788 | differs |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.1452 | differs |
| Adj R² | 0.139 | 0.1337 | differs |
| N | 756 | 756 | matches |

**Fix**
1. Add **Hispanic** (A1). Omitting a covariate can change other coefficients and significance (notably prestige, female, southern).
2. Ensure **identical reference categories**:
   - Race dummies: if the PDF uses White as reference, you must include `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` with White omitted.
   - Religion dummies: ensure “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” are coded vs the same omitted category as the paper.
3. Ensure standardization approach matches the paper (E1). A sign flip on prestige (true: -0.006 vs generated: +0.006) is small, but it signals the model is not identical (often sample/coding).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.161** | differs |
| HH income pc | -0.009 | -0.012 | differs |
| Occ prestige | -0.022 | -0.008 | differs (and magnitude) |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.114* | differs |
| Age | 0.110* | 0.060 | **coef & sig differ strongly** |
| Black | 0.049 | 0.062 | differs |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | — | **omitted** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.051 | close |
| Cons Prot | 0.066 | 0.053 | differs |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.020 | close |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.087 | **coef & sig differ** |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.166** | **sig differs** (*** vs **) |
| Constant | 6.516 | 7.355 | differs |
| R² | 0.169 | 0.1394 | **big mismatch** |
| Adj R² | 0.148 | 0.1165 | **big mismatch** |
| N | 503 | 426 | **major mismatch** |

**Fix**
- The **N mismatch (503 vs 426)** is the biggest red flag; it will distort coefficients, R², and p-values.
- Add Hispanic (A1).
- Recreate the political intolerance index exactly as in the paper (E2). If your `political_intolerance` coding differs (different items, scaling, missing handling), you can easily lose ~80 cases and change effect sizes and R².

---

## C) Sample size (N) mismatches and why they matter

### C1) Model 1 N mismatch: **True N=787 vs Generated N=758**
Generated output shows listwise deletion driven by missingness in `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`.

**Fix**
- Determine whether the paper used:
  1) **pairwise deletion** for standardized coefficients, or  
  2) **imputation**, or  
  3) **a different operationalization** with fewer missing values, or  
  4) **a different survey subsample filter** (e.g., only those asked all music items, only certain year, etc.)

Your diagnostics show `N_complete_music_18 = 893`, so DV complete-case isn’t the issue; it’s covariate missingness. To match 787, you need **only 106 missing from 893**, not 135 missing (893-758).

Concretely:
- Check whether the paper used a different income variable with less missingness, or treated some “DK/refused” codes differently (e.g., recoded to median/mean rather than missing).
- Check whether prestige was missing due to employment status coding—papers sometimes assign prestige from last job or spouse, etc.

---

### C2) Model 3 N mismatch: **True N=503 vs Generated N=426**
Your missingness table shows `political_intolerance` nonmissing = 491 among DV-complete, which already prevents reaching 503. That implies your political intolerance variable is not constructed the same way and/or you are filtering too aggressively.

**Fix**
- Rebuild the political intolerance measure to achieve nonmissing N consistent with the paper.
Typical causes:
1. You used a **single item** with lots of missing; the paper used an **index** averaging multiple items with partial nonresponse rules.
2. You required **complete responses to all intolerance items**; the paper allowed computation if at least k items present.
3. You restricted to year 1993 differently than the paper, or combined years.

Until `political_intolerance` nonmissing is at least ~503 (and then listwise with other covariates), you cannot match the printed model.

---

## D) Standard errors and table formatting/reporting mismatches

### D1) You are printing SE-looking rows, but the PDF table prints **no standard errors**
- **True Results:** explicitly: “Table 1 … does not print standard errors.”
- **Generated Results:** table shows lines that look like additional rows under each coefficient (e.g., `-0.034`, then another number under it), implying SEs or extra coefficient rows, but they are not labeled and don’t correspond to the PDF.

**Fix**
- Remove standard errors from the table entirely to match the PDF presentation.
- Present only standardized coefficients and stars.
- If you must compute SEs for p-values, do so internally but don’t print them.

---

### D2) Star thresholds mismatch in Model 3 political intolerance term
- **True:** 0.164*** (p<.001)
- **Generated:** 0.166** with p_raw = 0.00147 (which is **not < .001**)

This is not just formatting—your p-value is different because the model/sample differs.

**Fix**
- Fix N and variable construction first (Section C/E). Once model matches, p should align and stars will follow.

---

## E) Interpretation / operationalization mismatches

### E1) “Standardized coefficients” must be computed the same way
Even with the same variables, standardized betas can differ if:
- you standardized using the estimation sample vs full sample,
- you standardized y and x vs using post-hoc beta conversion,
- you used weights (paper may use weights; you appear unweighted),
- you handled missingness differently before standardization.

**Fix**
- Replicate the paper’s standardization procedure:
  - If the paper standardized using **listwise sample**, do that.
  - If it standardized using **full available sample**, do that.
- Check whether survey weights were used in the article; if yes, you need weighted OLS and weighted standardization.

---

### E2) Political intolerance measure likely not matching the paper
Your `political_intolerance` ranges like 0–7 in the sample printout. That could be correct, but the missingness is huge (402 missing of 893), and the resulting N is far below the paper.

**Fix**
- Locate the exact items used in the intolerance scale in the paper and rebuild:
  - same items,
  - same coding direction,
  - same summation/averaging,
  - same missing-data rule (e.g., allow up to 1 missing item),
  - same rescaling if any.

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the PDF (action checklist)

1. **Add Hispanic** to Models 2 and 3 using the correct dataset variable and correct reference group.
2. **Reconstruct political_intolerance** exactly as the paper defines it; loosen overly strict complete-case requirements if the paper did.
3. **Match N**:
   - Model 1 must be 787 (currently 758): revisit missing handling for income/prestige/education and any filters.
   - Model 3 must be 503 (currently 426): driven mostly by intolerance variable construction/missing rules.
4. **Match model specification and reference categories** for race/religion/region; confirm dummy coding.
5. **Use the same standardization and weighting** approach as the paper.
6. **Remove SEs from the printed table** (PDF doesn’t report them); output only standardized betas + stars + fit stats.
7. After (1)–(5), re-check:
   - coefficients (especially prestige sign in Model 2; age and southern in Model 3),
   - R² / Adj R²,
   - significance stars (notably political intolerance should be ***).

If you paste the code (or at least the exact variable list and how `political_intolerance` and `income_pc` were constructed), I can point to the precise lines causing the N loss and coefficient shifts and specify the corrected recodes/model formula.
