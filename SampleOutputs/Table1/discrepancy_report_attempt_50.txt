Score: 31/100
============================================================

Below is an item-by-item comparison of the **Generated Results** vs the **True Results (Table 1)**. I flag **every mismatch** in (a) variable names/presence, (b) coefficients (β), (c) constants, (d) fit statistics (R²/Adj R²/N), and (e) interpretation implied by signs/significance. Then I explain **how to fix** the generated analysis so it reproduces Table 1.

---

## 1) Fit statistics mismatches (R², adjusted R², N)

### Model 1 (SES)
**Generated fit_stats:** N=1347, R²=0.0876, Adj R²=0.0856  
**True:** N=787, R²=0.107, Adj R²=0.104

**Mismatches**
- N is far larger (1347 vs 787).
- R² and Adj R² are too low.

**Fix**
- Use the **same analytic sample as the paper**. Table 1’s N implies substantial listwise deletion and/or additional sample restrictions beyond what your missingness table suggests.
- Ensure you are using **GSS 1993 only** and the same universe/filters (e.g., valid responses for DV and IVs, and any age/music-module restrictions).
- Apply **listwise deletion per model** exactly as the paper did (likely: drop DK/NA/INAP codes, restrict to asked subsample for genre dislikes, etc.). Your N_model_frames suggests you are listwise-deleting, but on a *different* cleaned dataset than the authors’.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
**Generated:** N=895, R²=0.0909, Adj R²=0.0807  
**True:** N=756, R²=0.151, Adj R²=0.139

**Mismatches**
- N too high (895 vs 756).
- R²/Adj R² much too low.

**Fix**
- Same as Model 1, plus ensure **race/ethnicity and religion variables are coded exactly** like the paper (miscoding can reduce explanatory power and change N if INAP handling differs).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
**Generated:** N=588, R²=0.1006, Adj R²=0.0834  
**True:** N=503, R²=0.169, Adj R²=0.148

**Mismatches**
- N too high (588 vs 503).
- R²/Adj R² far too low.

**Fix**
- Align the **political intolerance** measure construction and missing-value handling to the paper.
- Make sure you’re using the same intolerance item(s)/scale and same coding direction.

---

## 2) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### “Other race” appears as NaN in Generated Models 2 & 3
**Generated (model2_full/model3_full):** `Other race = NaN` (no estimate)  
**True:** Other race is included with nonzero β (Model 2: 0.005; Model 3: 0.053)

**What this indicates**
- Perfect collinearity / empty category / dropped reference category issue.
- Or you accidentally created “Other race” in a way that is *always 0*, *always 1*, or redundant with other race dummies.

**Fix**
- Rebuild race dummies with a clear reference group.
  - Example: create indicators for **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race**, with **White** as reference (all three = 0).
- Confirm “Other race” actually has cases in the analytic sample after cleaning.
- Ensure you did **not** include a full set of race dummies plus an intercept in a way that causes dummy-variable trap.

### DV naming mismatch (minor, but relevant)
Generated uses `num_genres_disliked`; True calls it “Number of Music Genres Disliked” (same concept).  
**Potential issue:** your DV construction might not match the paper’s (see section 6 on interpretation/construct validity).

**Fix**
- Verify the DV exactly matches the paper’s coding (which genres included, how “disliked” is defined, how missing/INAP handled, any rescaling).

---

## 3) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model (sign, magnitude, significance)

Important: Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)**; your “Table1style” uses **beta**, which is appropriate to compare. Below I compare the **generated standardized β** to the **true β**.

### Model 1: SES

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.297*** | -0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.035 | -0.037 | close (small mismatch) |
| Prestige | 0.030 | 0.016 | too large |
| Constant | 9.676 | 10.920 | too low |
| R² | 0.0876 | 0.107 | too low |
| N | 1347 | 787 | too high |

**Fix**
- Main culprit is **sample + variable construction** (DV/IV coding). Prestige and constant especially suggest non-matching scaling/coding and/or different sample.
- Make sure prestige uses the same prestige scale/version (your variable is `prestg80_v`; confirm it matches what paper used).
- Confirm education is measured identically (years vs degree recode). The paper labels “Education” without “years”; you assume years—could be correct, but verify.

### Model 2: Demographic

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.217*** | -0.246*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.021 | -0.054 | **substantially too small** |
| Prestige | -0.008 | -0.006 | close |
| Female | -0.071* | -0.083* | somewhat smaller |
| Age | 0.058 (ns) | 0.140*** | **major mismatch** (size + significance) |
| Black | -0.069 (ns) | 0.029 (ns) | **sign mismatch** |
| Hispanic | 0.010 (ns) | -0.029 (ns) | **sign mismatch** |
| Other race | blank/NA | 0.005 | **missing estimate** |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.112** | 0.059 | **too large and wrong sig** (true is not starred) |
| No religion | 0.003 | -0.012 | sign mismatch (small) |
| Southern | 0.069* | 0.097** | too small; weaker significance |
| Constant | 8.205 | 8.507 | too low |
| R² | 0.0909 | 0.151 | too low |
| N | 895 | 756 | too high |

**Fix (high priority issues)**
1. **Age effect is completely off**:  
   - Likely age is mis-coded (e.g., top-coded, missing recodes, wrong scale, centered incorrectly shouldn’t affect β though, but wrong inclusion set will).
   - Or you are using a different DV construction (age correlates differently with your DV than with the paper’s).
   - Verify `age_v` equals the paper’s age variable and that you’re excluding INAP/DK properly.

2. **Race coefficients’ signs disagree**:  
   - This usually comes from **different reference category** or incorrect dummy coding.
   - Ensure the reference group is **White** (likely in the paper), and that “Black/Hispanic/Other” are mutually exclusive and correctly derived.

3. **Income per capita effect far smaller than true**:  
   - Potentially you computed **income per capita differently** than the authors (e.g., household income / household size vs something else).
   - Or used a non-comparable income variable (e.g., already-adjusted/real dollars vs categories).
   - Align the income-per-capita construction to the paper (including any transformations like log, trimming, or dealing with zero/negative).

4. **Conservative Protestant too large and over-significant**:  
   - Strong sign that your religious tradition coding doesn’t match. “Conservative Protestant” in GSS often requires **denomination + fundamentalism** or a tradition scheme (Steensland et al.).
   - If you used a simpler indicator (e.g., literalist, or any Protestant), you will not reproduce the paper.

### Model 3: Political intolerance

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.162** | -0.151** | close (slightly larger magnitude) |
| Income pc | -0.026 | -0.009 | too negative |
| Prestige | 0.014 | -0.022 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.094* | -0.095* | essentially matches |
| Age | 0.026 (ns) | 0.110* | **major mismatch** |
| Black | -0.051 | 0.049 | **sign mismatch** |
| Hispanic | -0.007 | 0.031 | **sign mismatch** |
| Other race | blank/NA | 0.053 | **missing estimate** |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.091* | 0.066 | too big; wrong sig (true has no star) |
| No religion | 0.032 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.104* | 0.121** | smaller; weaker sig |
| Political intolerance | 0.146*** | 0.164*** | too small |
| Constant | 7.217 | 6.516 | too high |
| R² | 0.1006 | 0.169 | too low |
| N | 588 | 503 | too high |

**Fix**
- Same core problems as Model 2 persist (age, race coding, religion coding, sample restrictions).
- Additionally, **prestige sign flips** from true negative to generated positive—this is a strong red flag for either:
  - wrong prestige variable/version,
  - wrong DV construction,
  - or different sample selection producing suppression effects (but a sign flip across a published replication is usually coding/sample mismatch first).

## 4) Standard errors: mismatch in what you report vs what “true” provides

**Generated:** You report p-values and have implied SEs (even if not shown everywhere).  
**True:** Table 1 **does not report SEs**, only β and stars.

**Mismatch**
- Not an error to compute SEs, but it **won’t match Table 1** if your goal is to “match the paper” *as printed*. Also your “Table1style” shows β with stars but your stars are driven by *your* p-values, which differ from the paper’s in several places (e.g., Age, Conservative Protestant, Southern).

**Fix**
- If the target is *Table 1 exactly*, format output to:
  - show **standardized β**, with stars based on your p-values **only after you replicate the same data/coding**,
  - and either omit SE entirely or mark as not reported.
- If the target is *substantive replication*, keep SEs but acknowledge Table 1 omitted them.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by sign/significance

Even without narrative text, your generated table implies several interpretations that conflict with the paper:

- **Age**: Generated suggests age is weak/non-significant (Models 2–3). True table shows age is **strongly positive** (0.140*** in Model 2; 0.110* in Model 3).  
  **Fix:** correct age coding + sample + DV coding.

- **Race effects**: Generated suggests Black is negative; True suggests small positive (ns) in both models. Hispanic sign also flips across models.  
  **Fix:** race dummy construction/reference group.

- **Prestige (Model 3)**: Generated positive; True negative.  
  **Fix:** prestige variable alignment and/or sample/DV.

- **Conservative Protestant**: Generated statistically significant positive; True is positive but **not significant** in both models.  
  **Fix:** religious tradition measure must match paper’s definition.

---

## 6) Why your N’s and coefficients are systematically off (likely root causes)

Your missingness table shows, for example:
- DV missing only ~4.3%,
- political intolerance missing ~36%,
- Hispanic missing ~34% (!!)

That “Hispanic” missingness rate is suspiciously high for a simple ethnicity indicator—often it should be near-complete if it’s a recode from race/ethnic items. This alone can inflate listwise deletion differences and distort estimates.

**Most likely root causes**
1. **Different construction of key covariates** (especially Hispanic, Conservative Protestant, income per capita, political intolerance).
2. **Different handling of GSS missing codes** (DK/NA/INAP coded as numeric values rather than set to missing).
3. **Different sample restrictions** than the paper (module subsamples; only respondents asked the music questions; etc.).
4. **Weighting**: your fit_stats has a “weight” column but empty—if the paper used weights and you didn’t (or vice versa), coefficients and N/R² can differ.

---

## 7) Concrete fixes to make the generated analysis match Table 1

### A. Replicate the paper’s sample exactly
- Filter to **GSS 1993** and the same respondent universe used for the music module.
- Recode all special codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) to missing for every variable used.
- Apply **listwise deletion per model** after recoding.
- Verify N matches: 787, 756, 503.

### B. Ensure standardized coefficients are computed the same way
- Table 1 reports standardized β for predictors. Replicate with:
  - OLS on raw variables, then compute standardized coefficients, **or**
  - pre-standardize predictors and DV (except constant will differ if you standardize DV; the paper’s constant is unstandardized, implying DV not standardized for intercept reporting).
- Best approach to match: run model on raw DV, compute **β = b * (sd(x)/sd(y))**.

### C. Rebuild problematic variables to match the paper’s definitions
1. **Hispanic / race dummies**
   - Create mutually exclusive categories and set **White** as reference.
   - Ensure “Hispanic” isn’t missing for a third of the sample; if it is, you’re pulling from the wrong source variable.

2. **Conservative Protestant**
   - Use the same classification scheme as the paper (often based on denomination + tradition). A simple “is Protestant” dummy will not match.

3. **Income per capita**
   - Confirm it is exactly *household income / household size* with the same income measure and same treatment of brackets, top-codes, and missing.

4. **Political intolerance**
   - Confirm the scale/items and direction match the paper’s measure.
   - Align missing-data handling to yield N=503 in Model 3.

5. **Occupational prestige**
   - Confirm the prestige score variable matches the year and coding used in the paper (your `prestg80_v` may not be the same operationalization).

### D. Fix factor coding so “Other race” is estimated
- Ensure “Other race” is not the reference category and not collinear.
- Confirm nonzero variance in the estimation sample.

### E. Only after A–D: re-check stars/significance
- Once coefficients match closely, your p-values/stars should line up better. If not, check:
  - weights and robust vs classical SEs,
  - clustering,
  - two-tailed thresholds (paper uses two-tailed).

## Summary of the biggest mismatches to correct first
1. **Ns and R²** are wrong in all models → sample restrictions + missing-code recodes are not matching the paper.
2. **Age** effect is dramatically underestimated → age coding and/or DV construction mismatch.
3. **Race/ethnicity** signs differ and “Other race” is dropped → dummy coding/reference and Hispanic construction are wrong.
4. **Conservative Protestant** is too large/too significant → religion tradition coding doesn’t match paper.
5. **Prestige (Model 3)** sign flip → prestige variable mismatch and/or sample/DV mismatch.

If you share your exact codebook choices (which GSS variables you used for Hispanic, conservative Protestant, income, intolerance, and how you treated missing codes/INAP), I can pinpoint precisely which recodes are causing each discrepancy and propose one-to-one replacements.
