Below is a complete mismatch audit between the **Generated Results** and the **True Results (Table 1)**, organized by: (A) fit statistics and N, (B) coefficients (β) and constants, (C) missing/incorrect variables, (D) standard errors / p-values and stars, and (E) interpretation. For each discrepancy, I explain *why it happened* and *how to fix it so the generated output reproduces Table 1*.

---

## A) Fit statistics and sample sizes (N): mismatches

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N mismatch**
  - Generated: **n = 747**
  - True: **n = 787**
  - Fix: apply the *same analytic sample restrictions* used in the paper. Your pipeline is dropping ~40 extra cases. Common causes:
    1) listwise deletion using variables not in Model 1 (e.g., dropping on `pol_intol` or race variables accidentally)
    2) treating “don’t know / refused / not applicable” codes as missing differently than the author
  - Concrete fix: when fitting Model 1, subset to complete cases **only on the Model 1 variables + DV** (and recode missing exactly as GSS/coded in the paper).

- **R² and adjusted R² mismatch**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.088**, **Adj R² = 0.085**
  - True: **R² = 0.107**, **Adj R² = 0.104**
  - Fix: once N and variable coding match the paper, R² should move toward the published values. If it still doesn’t:
    - ensure you are using **OLS with the same weighting scheme** (the paper may be unweighted; your analysis likely is unweighted too, but confirm)
    - ensure the DV and predictors match the paper’s construction (e.g., top-coding, valid ranges, etc.)

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N mismatch**
  - Generated: **n = 507**
  - True: **n = 756**
  - This is a *huge* discrepancy and is inconsistent with your own missingness table (you should have far more than 507 complete cases for these variables).
  - Fix:
    - verify you did not accidentally impose Model 3’s restriction (`pol_intol` non-missing) on Model 2
    - verify you are not merging/joining in a way that drops cases
    - verify that `hispanic` missingness (35%) is not being mishandled (e.g., treating “not asked” as missing when the paper treated as 0/non-Hispanic or used a different universe)

- **Dropped predictor: “otherrace”**
  - Generated fit_stats: `dropped_predictors = otherrace`
  - True: `Other race` is included with β reported in Models 2 and 3.
  - Fix: your `otherrace` column is likely perfectly collinear with the other race dummies + intercept (dummy trap), or is constant in the reduced sample you created.
    - Ensure your race coding matches the paper: typically **3 dummies with White as reference** (Black, Hispanic, Other), and *do not also include a “White” dummy*.
    - Ensure there is variation (non-zero cases) after subsetting.

- **R² mismatch**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.135**, **Adj R² = 0.118**
  - True: **R² = 0.151**, **Adj R² = 0.139**
  - Fix depends on correcting N and variable coding, plus ensuring you are reporting **standardized coefficients (β)** like Table 1.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N mismatch**
  - Generated: **n = 334**
  - True: **n = 503**
  - Fix: align missing-data handling for `pol_intol` and especially `hispanic`/race coding; confirm you’re not inadvertently requiring non-missing values for variables not in the model or additional filters.

- **Dropped predictor again: “otherrace”**
  - Same issue as Model 2; must be fixed for Table 1 replication.

- **R² mismatch**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.137**, **Adj R² = 0.108**
  - True: **R² = 0.169**, **Adj R² = 0.148**
  - Again: N + coding + correct standardization.

## B) Coefficients and constants: mismatches (β and constant)

### Core issue: you are mixing **unstandardized b** and standardized **β**, and your “Table1style” uses β—but those β don’t match the published β.

Your “table1style” outputs the `beta` column, which is correct *in principle* (Table 1 reports β). But most of your β values do not match the true β’s, implying at least one of:
1) different analytic sample (very likely, given N mismatches)
2) different variable coding / scaling (also likely)
3) incorrect standardization procedure (possible: e.g., standardizing using the wrong sample, or standardizing dummy variables differently than the paper did)
4) using different DV (but your DV descriptives look plausible)

Below are coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches.

---

### Model 1 (SES): β and constant mismatches

| Term | Generated (β / Constant) | True (β / Constant) | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude | match sample (N=787), education coding, and β calculation |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (minor) | likely resolves with sample alignment |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | slightly high | same as above |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | wrong constant | constants depend on unstandardized model + sample; fix N/coding |

**Important:** Table 1 constants are **unstandardized**. Your constant comes from an unstandardized fit, which is fine, but it will not match unless the sample and coding match.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic): many β mismatches + sign error

| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch type | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | -0.264*** | -0.246*** | magnitude off | sample/coding/standardization |
| Income pc | -0.053 | -0.054 | close | should align after sample fix |
| Prestige | -0.016 | -0.006 | too negative | sample/coding |
| Female | -0.090* | -0.083* | slightly off | sample/coding |
| **Age** | **0.104***? (actually only *) | **0.140*** | too small + wrong sig level | sample/coding; also stars based on your p-values, not the paper’s |
| Black | 0.043 | 0.029 | off | sample/coding |
| **Hispanic** | **+0.030** | **-0.029** | **sign is wrong** | race/Hispanic variable coding differs (very likely); ensure Hispanic dummy is coded same direction and reference group is White non-Hispanic |
| Other race | blank/NaN | 0.005 | missing due to dropped predictor | fix collinearity / coding |
| Cons Prot | 0.090 | 0.059 | too large | coding and/or religion construction differs |
| No religion | -0.019 | -0.012 | slightly off | coding |
| **Southern** | **0.063** | **0.097** | too small + wrong sig (you show none) | sample/coding; also your SE/p may differ |

Constant mismatch:
- Generated constant **9.285**
- True constant **8.507**
Fix: constant depends strongly on sample and coding.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): multiple β mismatches + major scale issue for income + missing otherrace

| Term | Generated β | True β | Mismatch type | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Education | -0.140* | -0.151** | magnitude + sig mismatch | sample/coding; and your p-values differ |
| **Income pc** | **-0.066** | **-0.009** | **major mismatch** | you likely scaled income per capita differently than the paper (e.g., dollars vs thousands; or logged vs not); align to paper’s definition |
| Prestige | 0.009 | -0.022 | sign mismatch | prestige coding or sample differs |
| Female | -0.124* | -0.095* | too negative | sample/coding |
| **Age** | 0.072 (ns) | 0.110* | smaller + sig mismatch | sample/coding |
| Black | 0.064 | 0.049 | off | sample/coding |
| Hispanic | 0.014 | 0.031 | off | sample/coding |
| Other race | blank/NaN | 0.053 | missing | fix collinearity/coding |
| Cons Prot | 0.052 | 0.066 | off | coding |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.024 | matches | good |
| **Southern** | 0.072 | 0.121** | much smaller + wrong sig | sample/coding |
| Political intolerance | 0.205*** | 0.164*** | too large | likely standardization/sample mismatch; also verify scale construction matches paper |

Constant mismatch:
- Generated **6.986**
- True **6.516**
Fix: sample/coding.

## C) Variable name / inclusion mismatches

1) **“Other race” missing entirely in Models 2 and 3**
- Generated: “Other race” rows are NaN and “otherrace” listed as dropped.
- True: Other race has nonzero β in both models.
- Fix: correct dummy coding to avoid collinearity and ensure it’s not constant after filtering.

2) **Your combined table (`table1_combined`) omits Model 2/3 variables**
- Generated `table1_combined` only shows Constant, Education, Income pc, Prestige.
- True Table 1 includes full set for Models 2 and 3.
- Fix: your “combine” step is incorrectly intersecting terms across models (keeping only common predictors). To match Table 1, you must **union** all terms and leave blanks where a model doesn’t include a variable.

3) **Label mismatch / coding mismatch: “Hispanic”**
- Generated shows positive β in Model 2; true is negative.
- Fix: check that your `hispanic` dummy is coded 1=Hispanic, 0=non-Hispanic; ensure reference category is White non-Hispanic, not “non-Black” or similar.

4) **Income per capita scaling mismatch (especially Model 3)**
- Generated β for income is far from true in Model 3.
- Fix: ensure the exact same income-per-capita construction as the paper (units, handling of zero/missing, potentially top-coding). A common repair is:
  - confirm whether income is in **actual dollars**, **$1,000s**, or an **ordinal category midpoint**
  - confirm whether “per capita” divides by household size in the same way as the author

---

## D) Standard errors, p-values, and stars: mismatches and why

### Key mismatch: True Table 1 does **not report SE**, and significance stars come from the paper’s model; your stars are computed from your own p-values
- Generated provides p-values and stars derived from your regressions.
- True extraction explicitly says: SE not reported; stars from the published table.

**Fix options (pick one depending on goal):**

1) **If your goal is to reproduce Table 1 exactly:**  
   - Do **not** report SE or p-values.  
   - Report **β** and the **same stars** as the paper.
   - Set SE column to “—” and omit p-values entirely.

2) **If your goal is to compute your own inference but still match coefficients:**  
   - First replicate coefficients/β and N exactly; then compute SE/p.  
   - But note: your SE/p may still differ if the paper used weights, robust SEs, or different missing data handling. You’d need to know the paper’s exact estimation details.

### Specific star mismatches caused by your p-values differing from paper’s
Examples:
- Model 2 Age: you have `*` (p≈.018) but paper has `***`.
- Model 3 Education: you have `*` but paper has `**`.
- Model 2 Southern: you show none, paper has `**`.
Fix: replicate the exact sample/coding and estimation; or if reproducing Table 1, hard-code the published stars.

---

## E) Interpretation mismatches (what your write-up would get wrong)

Even if not fully shown in your prompt, these are implied interpretation problems:

1) **Confusing b with β**
- Your model tables show both `b` and `beta`, but the Table 1-style output uses β. Any narrative must describe **standard deviation changes**, not raw unit changes, when referencing β.

2) **“Dropped predictor” not acknowledged**
- If you interpret “Other race” effects, you currently *cannot*, because it’s not estimated (NaN). This must be fixed before interpretation.

3) **Comparing across models with different N**
- Your Ns differ drastically across models (747 → 507 → 334). That makes coefficient comparisons across models potentially misleading because the sample changes.
- Table 1 also has changing N (787 → 756 → 503), but your drops are much larger.
- Fix: ensure each model uses the paper’s intended sample, or at minimum clearly state that sample changes drive differences.

## What to change in your workflow to match the True Results (action checklist)

1) **Recreate the analytic samples per model**
- Model 1: complete cases on DV + (educ, inc_pc, prestige) only → target **N=787**
- Model 2: complete cases on DV + Model 2 predictors → target **N=756**
- Model 3: complete cases on DV + Model 3 predictors (incl. pol_intol) → target **N=503**
- Do not accidentally apply Model 3 missingness to Model 2.

2) **Fix race dummy coding**
- Ensure: reference category = White (non-Hispanic) if that’s what the paper uses.
- Include exactly: Black, Hispanic, Other race (and intercept). Do not include all categories.

3) **Align variable construction**
- `inc_pc`: confirm identical scaling/units and construction to the paper (this is especially implicated by the Model 3 mismatch).
- `prestg80_v`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south`: ensure coding matches paper definitions.

4) **Compute standardized coefficients (β) the same way**
- Standardize using the estimation sample for each model.
- If you standardize by z-scoring, do it consistently for DV and predictors (the standard β from OLS corresponds to z-scored variables, but different software handles intercept/weights slightly differently).

5) **Fix the combined table**
- Combine by **union of terms**, not intersection, so Model 2/3 rows appear.

6) **Match reporting format**
- If matching Table 1: show **β and stars**, omit SE/p-values, keep constants unstandardized, and use the paper’s R²/Adj R² and N once replication is correct.

If you share your code (or at least how you construct `inc_pc`, `hispanic`, and the race dummies, plus your exact listwise deletion step), I can pinpoint which line(s) are causing the N collapse and the sign flip for Hispanic.
