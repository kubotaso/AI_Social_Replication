Score: 33/100
============================================================

### 0) Core structural discrepancy: you’re comparing different estimands
- **True Table 1** reports **standardized coefficients only** and **does not report SEs**.
- **Generated output** mixes:
  - a “table” that *looks* like it has **coefficients + SEs** (second line under each coefficient), and
  - a `coefficients_long` object labeled `beta_std` (standardized betas),
  - plus fit stats computed from the generated regression runs.

**Why this matters:** If you re-estimated models from data, your betas/R²/N will generally *not* match the printed table unless you (a) use the *same sample restrictions*, (b) use the *same variable constructions*, and (c) compute betas exactly as the authors did. Also, SEs cannot be “matched” because the true table doesn’t provide them.

**Fix:** Decide which target you’re matching.
- If matching the **PDF table**: output **standardized betas only**, omit SEs entirely, and ensure your **N/R²/Adj.R²** match.
- If matching **your re-estimation**: then you must stop calling the PDF’s numbers “true results” for SE comparisons (they aren’t provided).

## 1) Mismatches in variable names / included variables

### 1.1 Hispanic is missing in generated models (but present in true Models 2–3)
- **True table:** Hispanic included in Model 2 and Model 3 with coefficients:
  - Model 2: **-0.029**
  - Model 3: **0.031**
- **Generated:** `hispanic` is `NaN` and shown as “—”, with note: *“Hispanic not constructed”*. Also your table shows “—” for Hispanic in all models.

**Fix:**
- Construct a Hispanic dummy exactly as the authors did (typically from a race/ethnicity item; e.g., `hispanic = 1` if respondent identifies as Hispanic, else 0).
- Include it in Models 2 and 3.
- Re-run models and regenerate standardized betas.

### 1.2 Conservative Protestant / No religion construction likely inconsistent with authors
Not a “name” mismatch, but it’s a specification mismatch that shows up in coefficients (see §2). Generated uses:
- `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion` dummies

The true table uses the same labels, but if the underlying coding differs (e.g., which denominations count as “conservative Protestant”, what the reference category is), coefficients will not match.

**Fix:**
- Verify the **reference religion category** used by the authors (often “moderate/liberal Protestant + Catholic + other” collapsed, or similar).
- Recreate the same denominational grouping rules.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I list **every coefficient mismatch** between generated and true. (I’m comparing to your `coefficients_long beta_std`, which corresponds to standardized betas.)

### Model 1 (SES)
| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.310 | **-0.322** | differs (too small in magnitude) |
| income_pc | -0.038 | **-0.037** | small numeric difference |
| prestg80 | 0.025 | **0.016** | differs |

Also:
- **Constant:** generated 10.848 vs true 10.920 (mismatch; see §4)
- **R²/Adj.R²/N:** mismatch; see §4

**Fix:**
- Use the **same analytic sample** (true N=787 vs generated N=748) and same missing-data handling.
- Confirm income scaling (household income per capita—equivalization? inflation? top-coding?) and prestige scale construction.
- Compute standardized coefficients the same way (see §5).

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.246 | **-0.246** | matches (good) |
| income_pc | -0.052 | **-0.054** | differs slightly |
| prestg80 | 0.009 | **-0.006** | sign mismatch |
| female | -0.078 | **-0.083** | differs slightly |
| age | 0.112 | **0.140** | differs notably |
| black | 0.023 | **0.029** | differs |
| hispanic | NaN/omitted | **-0.029** | missing variable |
| other_race | 0.000 | **0.005** | differs |
| conservative_protestant | 0.091 | **0.059** | differs notably |
| no_religion | -0.000 | **-0.012** | differs |
| southern | 0.064 | **0.097** | differs notably |

**Fix:**
- Add **Hispanic** (major omission).
- Harmonize **age** (is it in years? centered? restricted range?).
- Harmonize **southern** definition (Census South? “born in South”? “currently lives in South”?).
- Harmonize **religion recodes** and reference category.
- Ensure the *same N* (true 756 vs generated 738).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| educ | -0.149 | **-0.151** | small difference |
| income_pc | -0.016 | **-0.009** | differs |
| prestg80 | -0.006 | **-0.022** | differs |
| female | -0.096 | **-0.095** | matches closely |
| age | 0.048 | **0.110** | differs notably |
| black | 0.057 | **0.049** | differs |
| hispanic | NaN/omitted | **0.031** | missing variable |
| other_race | 0.048 | **0.053** | small difference |
| conservative_protestant | 0.086 | **0.066** | differs |
| no_religion | 0.027 | **0.024** | close |
| southern | 0.064 | **0.121** | differs notably |
| political_intolerance | 0.176 | **0.164** | differs |

**Fix:**
- Add **Hispanic**.
- Reconstruct **political_intolerance** exactly (item set, coding direction, scaling, missing rules). Your sample loss (402 missing of 893) suggests construction differs from the authors’.
- Match the **estimation sample** (true N=503 vs generated N=417).

---

## 3) Standard errors: generated claims SEs, true table has none
In `table1_style`, you show a second row under each coefficient that looks like an SE (e.g., educ in Model 1 shows “-0.310***” then “-0.038”). But:

- The **true table explicitly does not provide SEs**.
- Those second-line numbers in your generated table are **not SEs from the true source**, and also don’t align with anything in `coefficients_long` (they look like other coefficients, not SEs).

**Fix options (pick one):**
1) **To match the PDF:** remove all SE rows from the table and print standardized betas only.
2) **To present re-estimated models:** keep SEs, but do **not** describe the comparison as “generated vs true” for SEs. Label them as “re-estimated SEs (not reported in Table 1).”

---

## 4) Fit statistics and sample size mismatches (N, R², Adj R², constants)

### N mismatches
- **True N:** M1 787, M2 756, M3 503  
- **Generated N:** M1 748, M2 738, M3 417

**Fix:**
- Identify and replicate the authors’ **sample restrictions**:
  - year/subsample selection,
  - listwise deletion rules (did they use pairwise? multiple imputation? different missing flags?),
  - any trimming (e.g., excluding outliers, restricting age).
- Your diagnostics show `N_complete_music_18 = 893` but then listwise drops are larger than needed if variables are coded differently (especially political intolerance).

### R² / Adj R² mismatches
- **True:** R² = 0.107 / 0.151 / 0.169
- **Generated:** R² = 0.097 / 0.127 / 0.130

These are not small deviations; they indicate you’re not reproducing the same model/sample/variable definitions.

**Fix:**
- After fixing sample selection and variable construction, recompute models; R² should move toward the printed values.
- Ensure you’re using **OLS on the same DV** with the same coding and range.

### Constants mismatch
- **True constants:** 10.920 / 8.507 / 6.516  
- **Generated:** 10.848 / 8.680 / 7.164

**Fix:**
- Constants will change with sample composition and with any centering/standardization decisions. If the table truly reports *standardized coefficients but raw constant*, confirm whether the authors used:
  - raw DV and raw X (then standardized betas computed post-hoc), or
  - fully standardized regression (then constant should be ~0).
- Replicate their approach. Your generated table appears to combine standardized betas with a raw intercept—this can be valid, but only if computed consistently with the authors.

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches

### 5.1 Significance stars differ because some coefficients differ
Examples:
- **Education, Model 3:** true is **-0.151\*\***, generated is **-0.149\*** (different star level).
- **Age, Model 3:** true **0.110\***, generated **0.048** (non-sig).
- **Southern, Models 2–3:** true **0.097\*\*** and **0.121\*\***, generated ~0.064 (non-sig).

**Fix:**
- Once coefficients and N match, p-values/stars should align more closely—but note: if the PDF uses standardized betas without SEs, the star assignment came from the authors’ own underlying SEs. You can only reproduce stars if you reproduce the *exact estimation* (same weights, clustering, heteroskedasticity corrections, etc.).

### 5.2 Interpretation: political intolerance effect direction/size mismatch
- **True:** political intolerance = **0.164***  
- **Generated:** **0.176*** (same direction, larger)

**Fix:**
- Recreate the intolerance scale exactly (items included, reverse-coding, range). Also ensure the same sample (true N=503).

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true table

1) **Stop printing SEs** if the goal is to match Table 1.
2) **Recreate Hispanic** and include it in Models 2–3.
3) **Reconstruct political intolerance** to reduce missingness and match N≈503:
   - check which respondents were asked the items,
   - replicate the authors’ missing-data rule (e.g., mean of available items vs listwise across items).
4) **Match sample restrictions** to hit N=787/756/503:
   - same year,
   - same age restrictions (if any),
   - same handling of “don’t know/refused/not asked”.
5) **Verify variable codings**:
   - `southern` definition,
   - `conservative_protestant` and `no_religion` categories and reference group,
   - `income_pc` definition (per capita using which household size? any transformations?).
6) **Compute standardized coefficients the same way** the authors did:
   - either run regression on z-scored variables, or
   - convert unstandardized b’s to betas using SD ratios.
   Use the method that reproduces their betas most closely and apply consistently across all models.
7) Re-run and check **betas + R² + Adj R² + N** against the table; iterate until aligned.

If you share the code that constructs `hispanic`, `political_intolerance`, `southern`, and the exact filtering steps used to get the model samples, I can pinpoint which specific line(s) cause each N and coefficient discrepancy.
