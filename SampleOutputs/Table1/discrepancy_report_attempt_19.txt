## 1) Global/table-level mismatches (fit stats, N, standardization)

### A. **Sample sizes (n) are wrong in every model**
- **Generated:** M1 n=747; M2 n=481; M3 n=272  
- **True:** M1 n=787; M2 n=756; M3 n=503  
**Why it’s a discrepancy:** These models are supposed to reproduce the paper’s table; the paper uses much larger analytic samples. Your `missingness` table shows heavy missingness on `pol_intol` and `num_genres_disliked`, which can explain shrinking n—but then you are *not reproducing the paper’s estimation sample/handling of missing data*.

**How to fix**
- Recreate the paper’s *exact* sample restrictions and missing-data handling:
  - Ensure you’re using **GSS 1993 only** and the same **age range/eligibility** as the paper (if any).
  - Confirm you’re using the same **dependent variable construction** (“number of music genres disliked”) and not a different item or coding.
  - Align missing-data treatment with the paper. If the paper uses listwise deletion, your n should match once the same variables and codings are used. If you can’t reach the paper’s n, you likely have different variable definitions or you’re inadvertently dropping cases (e.g., via merges, recodes to NA, filtering).
  - Check especially `pol_intol`: you show **47% missing**, which would severely reduce Model 3—yet the paper still has **n=503**, not 272. That suggests your `pol_intol` construction is making far more cases missing than in the paper (coding error, wrong source items, wrong year, or treating “DK/NA” differently).

### B. **R² and adjusted R² do not match**
- **Model 1:** Generated R²=0.088 vs True R²=0.107  
- **Model 2:** Generated R²=0.138 vs True R²=0.151  
- **Model 3:** Generated R²=0.146 vs True R²=0.169  
**How to fix**
- First fix the **sample/variable construction** (above). R² differences commonly arise from different samples and different codings.
- Second, ensure the paper’s estimation choices:
  - The paper reports **standardized OLS coefficients (β)**. R² itself is unaffected by standardizing *predictors/outcome* in a simple OLS sense, but discrepancies often indicate you are not fitting the same model to the same cases.

---

### C. **You are treating coefficients as unstandardized, but the “true” table is standardized β**
- **True:** explicitly says **standardized OLS coefficients (β)**; constants unstandardized.
- **Generated:** presents coefficients without stating standardization; your values do not line up with β’s in the paper.

**How to fix**
- Standardize variables before regression (or compute standardized coefficients after fitting):
  - Standardize **all predictors and the outcome** (or compute β via `b * sd(x)/sd(y)`).
  - Keep the **intercept unstandardized** if you want to mimic the paper’s convention (many tables still show an intercept even when reporting standardized slopes; your intercept should then match the paper only if you mimic their exact approach—often it won’t if you fully z-score y).

---

### D. **Standard errors are shown/implicit in your output but are not in the paper**
- **True:** “SE not reported”
- **Generated:** has stars implying SE/p-values were computed, but no SE column; still you are effectively claiming inferential results from your own model rather than reproducing the paper.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is *table replication*, output **only coefficients and stars**, not SEs.
- Or, if you keep SEs for transparency, explicitly label them as **recomputed** and not from the paper—and don’t call it an exact match.

---

## 2) Variable name mismatches (labeling vs constructs)

These are mostly cosmetic but matter for replication clarity:

- **Generated term labels vs True labels**
  - `Education (years)` vs **Education**
  - `inc_pc` shown in missingness vs “Household income per capita”
  - `prestg80_v` vs “Occupational prestige”
  - `pol_intol` vs “Political intolerance”
  - `num_genres_disliked` aligns conceptually with “Number of music genres disliked” (good), but verify it is *constructed identically*.

**How to fix**
- Use the paper’s labels in the output table and confirm the underlying coding:
  - e.g., rename `educ_yrs` → `Education`, `inc_pc` → `Household income per capita`, etc.
- More importantly: verify the *scales* match the paper (e.g., political intolerance 0–15).

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (and significance mismatches)

Below, “Mismatch” means the generated coefficient (and/or star) differs from the true β (and/or star).

### Model 1 (SES)

| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | coefficient differs |
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | coefficient differs |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | slight coefficient differ |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | coefficient differs |

**Likely causes**
- Different **n/sample** (you have 747 vs 787)
- Unstandardized vs standardized slopes

**Fix**
- Match sample and compute standardized β.

### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Constant | 9.643 | 8.507 | differs a lot (also affected by standardization/sample) |
| Education | -0.267*** | -0.246*** | coefficient differs |
| Income pc | -0.054 | -0.054 | matches |
| Prestige | -0.008 | -0.006 | differs slightly |
| Female | -0.091* | -0.083* | differs slightly |
| Age | 0.090* | 0.140*** | **coefficient and significance wrong** |
| Black | 0.067 | 0.029 | differs |
| Hispanic | 0.046 | -0.029 | **sign differs** |
| Other race | -0.013 | 0.005 | sign differs |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.069 | 0.059 | differs |
| No religion | -0.025 | -0.012 | differs |
| Southern | 0.065 | 0.097** | **coefficient and significance wrong** |
| R² | 0.138 | 0.151 | differs |
| n | 481 | 756 | **wrong** |

**Interpretation mismatches implied by stars**
- **Age**: generated suggests weak positive (*), true is stronger (***).
- **Southern**: generated non-significant, true significant (**).
- **Hispanic/Other race**: sign flips suggest you are not reproducing the same coding or reference categories, or you’re on a very different sample.

**Fixes**
1. **Reference categories/coding**
   - Confirm race is dummy-coded with the same reference group as the paper (typically White non-Hispanic as reference).
   - Confirm `hispanic` is coded consistently (paper’s “Hispanic” is a group indicator; you might be mixing ethnicity with race, or using a different GSS variable).
2. **Age scaling**
   - Check if age was entered as years (likely) and not rescaled/centered incorrectly.
3. **Sample**
   - n must be brought to 756 via correct listwise deletion and variable availability for 1993.
4. **Standardized coefficients**
   - Compute β’s to match the paper’s metric.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)

| Term | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Constant | 7.902 | 6.516 | differs |
| Education | -0.157* | -0.151** | star differs (* vs **) |
| Income pc | -0.055 | -0.009 | **large mismatch** |
| Prestige | -0.023 | -0.022 | close |
| Female | -0.130* | -0.095* | coefficient differs |
| Age | 0.088 | 0.110* | significance differs |
| Black | 0.114 | 0.049 | differs |
| Hispanic | 0.003 | 0.031 | differs |
| Other race | 0.067 | 0.053 | differs |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.024 | 0.066 | differs a lot |
| No religion | 0.011 | 0.024 | differs |
| Southern | 0.068 | 0.121** | **coefficient and significance wrong** |
| Political intolerance | 0.155* | 0.164*** | **significance wrong** |
| R² | 0.146 | 0.169 | differs |
| n | 272 | 503 | **wrong** |

**Most diagnostic problems**
- **Income per capita**: -0.055 vs -0.009 is not a small discrepancy; that screams different scaling, coding, or sample selection.
- **Political intolerance**: star level is far off (* vs ***), consistent with your n being much smaller (272), inflating SEs and reducing significance—or with different variable construction.

**Fixes**
1. **Rebuild `pol_intol` exactly**
   - Verify it is truly **0–15** with the same item set, scoring, and missing-data rules as the paper.
   - Your 47% missing suggests you may be requiring all component items non-missing when the paper used partial scoring or a different set of items.
2. **Income per capita**
   - Confirm you’re using the same transformation (raw, logged, standardized). A wrong transformation can easily change the slope magnitude.
3. **Bring n up to 503**
   - Once `pol_intol` and other predictors are coded like the paper, listwise deletion should yield n close to 503.

## 4) Interpretation mismatches (what your generated table *implies* vs what the true table says)

Even without written prose, your stars communicate substantively different conclusions:

- **Age effect**: Your generated results imply age is weak/non-robust (Model 2 only *; Model 3 ns). The true table implies age is **strongly positive** in Model 2 (***) and still positive in Model 3 (*).
- **Southern effect**: Your generated results imply little/no regional effect. True results show **Southern is consistently significant** (Model 2 **, Model 3 **).
- **Political intolerance**: Your generated results imply a marginal association (*). True results show a **strong association (***).**
- **Hispanic sign flip in Model 2**: Your generated suggests Hispanics dislike more genres; true suggests they dislike fewer (though not significant). That’s a substantive directional mismatch.

**Fix**
- These interpretation mismatches should resolve when:
  1) coefficients are computed in the same metric (standardized β),
  2) the analytic sample matches,
  3) dummy coding/reference groups match,
  4) key constructed indices (political intolerance) match.

## 5) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Filter the dataset** to exactly **GSS 1993** and match any paper inclusion criteria.
2. **Reconstruct the DV** exactly as the paper: “number of music genres disliked” (confirm the genre list, dislike coding, and how missing is handled).
3. **Reconstruct political intolerance (0–15)** exactly:
   - same items
   - same scoring
   - same missing rule (do not accidentally set huge shares to missing)
4. **Ensure identical coding** for:
   - race/ethnicity dummies + reference category
   - religion categories (Conservative Protestant, No religion) + reference category
   - Southern indicator definition
5. **Use listwise deletion consistent with the paper** (or match their stated method).
6. **Report standardized coefficients (β)** for slopes and use the paper’s star thresholds.
7. **Verify model N and R²** after each fix; do not proceed until N matches (787/756/503) or you can explain exactly why it cannot with your data source.

If you share the exact variable construction code (especially for `pol_intol`, `num_genres_disliked`, and race/ethnicity), I can pinpoint which specific recode/missingness rule is producing the biggest departures (notably the n collapse and the sign flip for Hispanic in Model 2).
