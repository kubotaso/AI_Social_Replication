## 1) Fit statistics / sample sizes: all mismatched

### Mismatches
- **N (cases)**
  - Generated: M1 **747**, M2 **507**, M3 **286**
  - True: M1 **787**, M2 **756**, M3 **503**
- **R² / Adj. R²**
  - Generated: M1 **0.088 / 0.085**, M2 **0.135 / 0.118**, M3 **0.145 / 0.111**
  - True: M1 **0.107 / 0.104**, M2 **0.151 / 0.139**, M3 **0.169 / 0.148**
- **Dropped variable**
  - Generated says **“otherrace” dropped** in Models 2–3 (and shows “Other race = NaN”).
  - True table includes **Other race** with nonzero β in Models 2–3.

### How to fix
1. **Use the same estimation sample across models as the paper** (or replicate the paper’s listwise deletion rules).
   - Your Ns strongly suggest you’re doing *much stricter* listwise deletion (or filtering) than the paper.
   - Check: missingness handling, any prior subsetting, and whether weights were applied.
2. **Ensure “Other race” is coded and included as a valid dummy** (not all-missing / not perfectly collinear).
   - Confirm race dummies have a clear reference category (typically White) and that “Other race” has at least some 1s.
3. **Recompute R²/Adj. R² after matching the sample and specification.**
   - Once N and predictors match, R² should move toward the published values.

## 2) Variable name / inclusion problems

### Mismatches
- **Outcome labeling/interpretation risk**: Generated output doesn’t explicitly state the DV, while the true table is **Number of Music Genres Disliked**. If your DV differs (or is reversed), coefficients will not match.
- **Race variable mismatch**
  - Generated: “Other race” is present but **NaN** (dropped)
  - True: “Other race” is included with β:
    - Model 2: **0.005**
    - Model 3: **0.053**

### How to fix
- Verify the DV is exactly **count of disliked genres** constructed identically to the paper.
- Ensure race is represented by **three dummies (Black, Hispanic, Other race)** with **White omitted** (or whatever the paper used), and that “Other race” is not accidentally coded as missing or merged into another category.

## 3) Coefficients: standardized (β) vs unstandardized (b) confusion and mismatches

### Key issue
The **true Table 1 reports standardized coefficients (β)** (and constants unstandardized).  
Your generated results mix:
- **b (unstandardized)** + **beta (standardized)** + **p-values** + **SEs implied**
But your **table1** uses the **beta** column (standardized), which is the right target—yet many of your β values do not match the published β.

### Model 1 (SES) mismatches (β)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292** | **-0.322** | No |
| Income p.c. | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | Close but not equal |
| Occ prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | No |
| Constant (unstd.) | **10.638** | **10.920** | No |

### Model 2 mismatches (β)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.264** | **-0.246** | No |
| Income p.c. | **-0.053** | **-0.054** | Close |
| Occ prestige | **-0.016** | **-0.006** | No |
| Female | **-0.090** | **-0.083** | No |
| Age | **0.104** | **0.140** | No |
| Black | **0.043** | **0.029** | No |
| Hispanic | **0.030** | **-0.029** | **Sign error** |
| Other race | **missing** | **0.005** | No |
| Cons Protestant | **0.090** | **0.059** | No |
| No religion | **-0.019** | **-0.012** | No |
| Southern | **0.063** | **0.097** | No |
| Constant (unstd.) | **9.285** | **8.507** | No |

### Model 3 mismatches (β)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.157** | **-0.151** | Close but not equal |
| Income p.c. | **-0.050** | **-0.009** | Big mismatch |
| Occ prestige | **-0.011** | **-0.022** | No |
| Female | **-0.122** | **-0.095** | No |
| Age | **0.083** | **0.110** | No |
| Black | **0.107** | **0.049** | No |
| Hispanic | **0.028** | **0.031** | Close |
| Other race | **missing** | **0.053** | No |
| Cons Protestant | **0.037** | **0.066** | No |
| No religion | **0.024** | **0.024** | **Matches** |
| Southern | **0.065** | **0.121** | No |
| Political intolerance | **0.190** | **0.164** | No |
| Constant (unstd.) | **7.360** | **6.516** | No |

### How to fix (for coefficient matching)
To match published standardized βs, you must replicate **exactly**:
1. **Sample definition (biggest driver)**  
   Your Ns are far smaller, so you’re estimating on a different population.
2. **Variable coding**
   - Hispanic sign reversal in Model 2 is a red flag: you may have **reversed the dummy** (e.g., 1 = non-Hispanic) or used a different reference coding.
   - “Household income per capita” in Model 3 is wildly off (β -0.050 vs -0.009): likely a **different income transform**, different scaling, or missing/winsorization differences.
3. **Standardization method**
   - Standardized β in OLS is typically computed as:  
     \[
     \beta_j = b_j \times \frac{SD(x_j)}{SD(y)}
     \]
   - If you standardized inputs differently (e.g., z-scoring with missing handling differences, weights, or using sample SD vs population SD), βs will shift.
4. **Weights / design corrections**
   - If the paper used **GSS weights** (common), and you did not (or vice versa), coefficients and Ns can differ.
5. **Model specification details**
   - Ensure identical predictor set and identical reference categories.
   - Confirm political intolerance scale is exactly **0–15** as stated.

## 4) Standard errors & p-values: not comparable to “true” table

### Mismatches
- Generated reports **p-values and (implicitly) SEs**, and uses stars based on those.
- True table explicitly says **SEs are not reported** and stars reflect significance but you cannot “compare SEs” to the paper because there are none given.

### How to fix
- If your goal is to match Table 1 **as printed**, you should:
  - **suppress SEs/p-values** in the output table (or mark SE as “—”),
  - and compute stars using your model p-values *only after* you have replicated the sample/coding so the stars align.
- If you still want SEs for your own reporting, that’s fine—but don’t claim they match Table 1.

## 5) Significance stars: several mismatches

Because coefficients differ, your significance markers also differ. Examples:
- **Model 2 Age**: Generated `*` (p≈.018) vs True `***`
- **Model 3 Political intolerance**: Generated `**` (p≈.00265) vs True `***`
- **Model 3 Age**: Generated not significant vs True `*`
- **Model 2 Southern**: Generated not significant vs True `**`

### How to fix
Stars will only align after:
1) matching N/sample, 2) matching coding/scales, and 3) matching weighting and standardization.

---

## 6) Interpretation mismatches implied by the generated table

### Mismatch risk
Your generated narrative (implied by showing unstandardized b and standardized β together) can easily misinterpret magnitudes:
- The paper’s table is about **relative effect sizes (standardized β)**, not unit changes in the original metric (except the constant).

### How to fix
- When writing the interpretation, emphasize:
  - **β interpretation**: “a 1 SD increase in X is associated with β SD change in Y.”
  - Avoid interpreting the **b** column unless you are explicitly presenting unstandardized results (which the paper is not, except constants).

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match the “true” table
1. **Recreate the paper’s analytic sample** (target Ns: 787 / 756 / 503).  
2. **Recode dummies to match reference groups**, especially Hispanic and Other race.  
3. **Ensure “Other race” is included (not dropped)** and not collinear.  
4. **Match variable construction/scaling** (income per capita; political intolerance 0–15; education years; prestige measure).  
5. **Apply the same weights (or explicitly confirm none were used)**.  
6. **Report standardized coefficients in the final Table 1** (constants unstandardized; no SEs shown), and only then align stars.

If you share the codebook snippets or your exact recodes for race, income per capita, and the missing-data handling, I can pinpoint which step is causing (a) the huge N drop and (b) the Hispanic sign flip.
