Score: 50/100
============================================================

### 0) Big picture: what’s being compared
- The **True Results (PDF Table 1)** report **standardized coefficients only** (betas) and **do not report standard errors**.
- Your **Generated Results** table prints (a) the standardized coefficients and (b) a second line that appears to be **standard errors** (but cannot be validated against the PDF, because the PDF doesn’t provide SEs).
- Therefore, you *can* and should compare: **variable names, which variables are included, coefficient values (standardized betas), significance stars, constants, R²/Adj R², N, and interpretation**.  
- You **cannot** truthfully claim your SEs “match Table 1” because Table 1 does not contain SEs.

## 1) Variable name mismatches / labeling problems

### 1.1 Education / income / prestige naming differs
- **Generated variable names:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`
- **True Table 1 labels:** *Education*, *Household income per capita*, *Occupational prestige*

This is not “wrong” statistically, but it *is* a mismatch in reporting.

**Fix**
- Relabel variables in the output table to match the PDF:
  - `educ` → **Education**
  - `income_pc` → **Household income per capita**
  - `prestg80` → **Occupational prestige**

### 1.2 Political intolerance naming differs
- **Generated:** `political_intolerance`
- **True:** *Political intolerance*

Again mostly a presentation mismatch.

**Fix**
- Relabel `political_intolerance` to **Political intolerance** in the table.

## 2) Coefficient (standardized beta) mismatches — by model
Below I list **every coefficient mismatch** between Generated and True.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.332** | **-0.322** | yes (more negative by -0.010) |
| Income pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | yes |
| Prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | yes |

**Fix**
- These discrepancies strongly suggest your model is **not estimated on the same sample and/or not using the same standardization rules** as the PDF.
- The True model uses **N = 787**; yours uses **N = 758**. That alone can change betas.

Concrete steps:
1. **Reproduce the exact sample restrictions** used in the PDF Table 1 (see §5 on N).
2. Confirm you are computing **standardized coefficients in the same way** (typically beta = coefficient from regression on z-scored variables, or using `lm.beta`-style standardization). Minor differences can come from:
   - listwise deletion vs. imputation vs. pairwise handling
   - whether the DV is standardized too (usually betas standardize both DV and IVs)
   - weights (if the PDF used survey weights)

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.302** | **-0.246** | yes (substantial) |
| Income pc | -0.057 | -0.054 | small mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.007 | -0.006 | small mismatch |
| Female | -0.078 | -0.083 | mismatch |
| Age | **0.109** | **0.140** | mismatch |
| Black | 0.053 | 0.029 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | -0.017 | -0.029 | mismatch |
| Other race | -0.016 | 0.005 | mismatch (sign differs) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.040 | 0.059 | mismatch |
| No religion | -0.016 | -0.012 | mismatch |
| Southern | 0.079 | 0.097 | mismatch |

**Fix**
- This is not just rounding—your Model 2 looks like it’s fit on a **different dataset** than the PDF.
- True N for Model 2 is **756**, yours is **523**. That is a *massive* sample difference, enough to explain coefficient shifts and sign changes (e.g., “other race”).

To fix:
1. Identify why your N collapses to 523. Your diagnostics show:
   - DV complete: 893
   - `hispanic` nonmissing only 612 (281 missing)
   - That missingness plus other covariates is killing N.
2. The PDF’s N=756 implies the authors likely **did not treat Hispanic as missing for 281 cases** the way you did, or they:
   - recoded missing race/ethnicity differently,
   - used a different Hispanic variable (or coding),
   - combined race/ethnicity categories differently,
   - used imputation / included “missing” category,
   - or used a different year/subsample than your “1993” filter.

Actionable fix checklist:
- **Audit coding of race/ethnicity**: verify that “not Hispanic” is coded as 0 and not as missing/NA.
- If the raw data codes “not asked / inapplicable” as something like 8/9/0, you must recode to valid 0/1 rather than NA.
- Ensure `other_race` is a proper dummy with a defined reference group consistent with the PDF.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.157 | -0.151 | mismatch (small) |
| Income pc | **-0.067** | **-0.009** | mismatch (large) |
| Prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | mismatch |
| Female | -0.118 | -0.095 | mismatch |
| Age | 0.092 | 0.110 | mismatch |
| Black | 0.004 | 0.049 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.091 | 0.031 | mismatch |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | **match** |
| Conservative Protestant | -0.011 | 0.066 | mismatch (sign differs) |
| No religion | 0.018 | 0.024 | mismatch |
| Southern | 0.073 | 0.121 | mismatch |
| Political intolerance | **0.196** | **0.164** | mismatch |

**Fix**
- True N for Model 3 is **503**, yours is **293**—again, very different sample.
- Your diagnostics show `political_intolerance` nonmissing is only **491**, but the PDF has 503 cases. That’s already inconsistent (you can’t have 503 complete cases if your polintol nonmissing is 491), which signals **you’re not constructing `political_intolerance` the same way** as the PDF.

Concrete fixes:
1. Rebuild the political intolerance scale/index exactly as the authors did:
   - same items,
   - same coding direction,
   - same missing-data rule.
2. Your own diagnostics say: **“15/15 items required”**. That is an extremely strict rule and will shrink N a lot.
   - The PDF’s higher N suggests they likely allowed **some missing items** (e.g., require ≥ k of 15, or compute mean of available items) or used a different item count entirely.

---

## 3) Standard errors: cannot be validated; your table likely misleads

### 3.1 The PDF does not report SEs
- **True Results explicitly:** “Table 1… does not print standard errors.”
- **Generated table prints a second line under each coefficient** that looks like an SE.

That is a reporting discrepancy: you are presenting SEs **as if they’re part of Table 1 replication**, but they cannot be compared to the PDF.

**Fix options**
- **Option A (recommended):** Remove standard errors from the table entirely and print only standardized coefficients + stars, matching the PDF format.
- **Option B:** Keep SEs but clearly label the table as “OLS (standardized betas shown; SEs computed from our estimation, not reported in PDF)” and do **not** claim they match the PDF.

Also, if you keep SEs, ensure they are the right kind:
- If the PDF used **robust** SEs or **survey design** SEs, your conventional OLS SEs will differ.

---

## 4) Significance stars mismatches (interpretation/reporting errors)
Because stars depend on p-values, different N/specification leads to different stars. Still, compared to the PDF, these are mismatches you should flag.

### Model 2 stars
- **Female:** Generated has no star (p≈0.061), True has * (significant)
- **Age:** Generated has * only, True has *** (much stronger)
- **Southern:** Generated has no star (p≈0.061), True has **

### Model 3 stars
- **Education:** Generated *, True **  
- **Political intolerance:** Generated **, True ***

**Fix**
- Once you replicate the **same sample + same variable construction**, stars should align. If they still don’t:
  - confirm **two-tailed vs one-tailed** (True says two-tailed)
  - confirm whether the PDF uses **design/robust SEs**
  - confirm any **weights** and **clustering/stratification** if survey data

---

## 5) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj R², Constant, N)

### 5.1 N is wrong in all models
- **Model 1:** Generated 758 vs True 787
- **Model 2:** Generated 523 vs True 756
- **Model 3:** Generated 293 vs True 503

**Fix**
- You must replicate the authors’ **case selection** and **missing-data handling**.
- Your “missingness” tables show heavy missing in `hispanic` and especially `political_intolerance`. The PDF evidently retains many more cases, implying different recodes and/or less strict missingness rules.

### 5.2 R² / Adj R² mismatches
- Model 1 R²: 0.1088 vs 0.107 (close)
- Model 2 R²: 0.157 vs 0.151 (moderate mismatch)
- Model 3 R²: 0.152 vs 0.169 (bigger mismatch)

These track with the N/specification differences.

**Fix**
- R² will not match until:
  1) the **same cases** are used, and  
  2) the **same variable definitions** are used.

### 5.3 Constants differ a lot
- True constants: 10.920, 8.507, 6.516
- Generated constants: 11.086, 10.089, 7.583

A particularly large mismatch is Model 2 constant (10.089 vs 8.507).

**Fix**
- The constant depends on:
  - unstandardized model vs standardized reporting,
  - centering/scaling,
  - sample composition,
  - and coding of dummies (reference categories).
- Since Table 1 reports standardized coefficients but *still prints a constant*, the authors likely fit the model in **raw units** and then computed standardized betas for reporting, leaving the intercept from the raw model. If you instead fit a fully standardized regression (z-scored DV and IVs), your intercept would be ~0. Your intercepts are not 0, so you likely did raw DV, raw IVs, then computed standardized betas—which is consistent—but the **sample/coding mismatch** remains the main culprit.

---

## 6) Interpretation mismatches / internal inconsistencies in the generated write-up

### 6.1 Claiming replication while using different N
Any narrative that implies “these are the Table 1 results” is incorrect given the huge N differences (especially Models 2–3).

**Fix**
- Update interpretation to: “Using our constructed measures and complete-case estimation, we find…” unless/until you match N and coefficients.

### 6.2 Political intolerance scale construction is likely wrong
Your diagnostic: “15/15 items required” is a substantive analytic choice that dramatically reduces N and likely changes who is in Model 3 (selection bias).

**Fix**
- Implement the **same rule as the original study**. Common options:
  - require at least, say, **10 of 15 items** answered
  - compute an **average/scale score** over non-missing items
  - use **multiple imputation** for missing items
- You need to check the paper’s methods section, not Table 1, for this.

---

## 7) Practical “to-do” list to make the generated analysis match the True results
1. **Match the sample definition** used for Table 1 (year, age restrictions, exclusions).
2. **Recode race/ethnicity variables** so “not Hispanic” etc. are not erroneously treated as missing.
3. **Confirm dummy reference categories** match the authors’ (race baseline, religion baseline, region baseline).
4. **Reconstruct political intolerance** exactly (items, direction, scaling, missing rule). Your current “15/15 required” is almost certainly the reason Model 3 N is far too small.
5. **Use the same estimation approach**:
   - if the study uses **weights** (common in GSS-like data), apply them
   - if it uses robust/survey SEs, use them (even though SEs aren’t in Table 1, they affect stars)
6. **Output formatting**:
   - print **standardized coefficients only** (to match Table 1)
   - remove SEs or explicitly state SEs are your addition
   - use the Table 1 variable labels

If you share the code that constructs `hispanic`, `other_race`, and especially `political_intolerance` (and any filtering steps), I can pinpoint exactly why your N collapses and which recodes will recover the PDF’s Ns (787/756/503) and bring coefficients into alignment.
