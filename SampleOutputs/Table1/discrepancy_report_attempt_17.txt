### 1) Fit statistics: mismatches and fixes

**Mismatch A — Models 2 and 3 are not estimated (n=0, R²=NaN).**  
- **Generated:** Model 2 n=0; Model 3 n=0; R²/Adj R² are NaN.  
- **True:** Model 2 n=756, R²=0.151 (Adj 0.139); Model 3 n=503, R²=0.169 (Adj 0.148).  
**Cause (visible in your own output):** your model frames for Models 2 and 3 are *empty* because at least one required predictor is entirely missing (see “hispanic” below), and possibly because you’re doing listwise deletion across all predictors.  
**Fix:** correct the Hispanic variable construction and then re-fit with proper listwise deletion. After fixing, your model frame should have 756 (Model 2) and 503 (Model 3) complete cases if you’re matching the paper.

**Mismatch B — Model 1 n and R² differ from the true table.**  
- **Generated Model 1:** n=747; R²=0.088; Adj R²=0.0846  
- **True Model 1:** n=787; R²=0.107; Adj R²=0.104  
**Likely causes:**
1) Your dependent variable or key predictors are coded differently than the paper (e.g., different missing-value handling, different construction of “income per capita”, or different sample restrictions).  
2) Your listwise deletion is removing 40 more cases than the paper’s Model 1.  
**Fix:** replicate the paper’s sample definition and variable coding exactly:
- Ensure the DV is the same “number of music genres disliked” measure (same items, same years, same range, same missing codes).
- Ensure income-per-capita is computed the same way (and not accidentally introducing missingness or different scaling).
- Apply the same inclusion rules as the paper (e.g., respondents asked the music module, valid responses, etc.).
- Only then do listwise deletion for Model 1.

### 2) Coefficients: mismatches and fixes

#### Critical issue: you are comparing **unstandardized b** to a table of **standardized β**
The “True Results” explicitly say Table 1 reports **standardized OLS coefficients (β)** (with constants unstandardized). Your generated table reports both **b** and **beta**, but your narrative comparison must use the **beta column**, not b, to match the paper.

That said, even your **beta** values do not match closely enough, and Models 2–3 are missing entirely.

---

#### Model 1 (SES): mismatches

**Mismatch C — Constant differs.**
- **Generated constant (b):** 10.638  
- **True constant:** 10.920  
**Fix:** once sample/variable coding matches (n=787, same DV coding), the intercept will move. Intercepts are very sensitive to coding and sample restrictions.

**Mismatch D — Education standardized effect differs.**
- **Generated β (Education):** -0.292***  
- **True β (Education):** -0.322***  
**Fix:** this usually indicates differences in (a) sample, (b) education coding, or (c) standardization method. To match the paper:
- Use the exact education variable coding used in the paper (years? top-coding? handling “DK/NA”?).
- Compute standardized coefficients the same way (typical: standardize all variables except intercept, or compute β from b via `b * sd(x)/sd(y)` using the estimation sample).

**Mismatch E — Income standardized effect is close but not identical.**
- **Generated β (income pc):** -0.0386 (p=0.31)  
- **True β:** -0.037 (no star)  
This is fairly close; the remaining difference likely comes from sample/coding mismatch.  
**Fix:** align sample and income-per-capita construction; then report β (not p-values/SEs) to match the paper’s presentation.

**Mismatch F — Prestige standardized effect differs slightly.**
- **Generated β (prestige):** 0.0200  
- **True β:** 0.016  
Again, likely sample/coding/standardization differences.  
**Fix:** ensure you’re using the same occupational prestige measure/year (e.g., `prestg80` seems plausible, but verify it matches the paper) and same sample.

**Mismatch G — Significance reporting differs (paper uses stars only; you report p).**
- **Generated:** p-values and stars;  
- **True:** stars only (no SE, no p printed).  
**Fix:** if the goal is to “match the table,” suppress p/SE output and only show standardized β with stars at the paper’s thresholds.

---

#### Model 2 and Model 3: complete failure to estimate + root cause

**Mismatch H — every coefficient is NaN in Models 2–3 (and no R², no n).**
- **Generated:** all NaN because n=0  
- **True:** full coefficient sets with specific β and stars  
**Primary root cause (explicit in your missingness table):**
- `hispanic` has **0 nonmissing, 1606 missing (100% missing)**.
That alone guarantees listwise deletion yields an empty dataset for any model that includes `hispanic`.

**Fix for Hispanic variable:**
- Your `hispanic` dummy is being created incorrectly (common errors: using the wrong source field, coding all cases as missing due to a mistaken condition, or treating 0 as missing).
- Rebuild it from the correct GSS race/ethnicity fields. Depending on the dataset, Hispanic origin may be stored in variables like `hispanic`, `ethnic`, `hispan`, `ethnicgrp`, etc. The key is: **it cannot be all missing**.
- After rebuilding, verify: `hispanic` has plausible non-missing counts and a small-to-moderate % coded 1.

**Secondary sample-size driver:** `cons_prot` has 41.5% missing; `pol_intol` has 47.1% missing.  
That kind of missingness is compatible with the paper’s declining n across models (787 → 756 → 503), but only if the variables are coded correctly and the intended subsample is used.

### 3) Variable-name mismatches and mapping problems

Your generated regression output uses *labels* like “Education (years)” but your frames show raw names like `educ_yrs`. That’s fine, but you must ensure that the *content* matches the paper variables.

Key variable mismatches revealed by your output:

1) **Hispanic (`hispanic`) is unusable (100% missing).**  
   - This is the direct reason Models 2–3 are empty.  
   - **Fix:** rebuild variable; confirm nonmissing >0; rerun.

2) **Political intolerance naming and scaling.**  
   - Generated label: “Political intolerance (0–15)” and variable `pol_intol` with 47% missing.  
   - True: “Political intolerance” with β=0.164*** in Model 3 and n=503.  
   - **Fix:** confirm your `pol_intol` scale is exactly the paper’s (same items, same coding, same range, same direction). If your range is right but n doesn’t match after fixing Hispanic, your intolerance index construction or missing handling likely differs from the paper.

3) **Income per capita (`inc_pc`) scale.**  
   - Generated b is essentially 0 because income is likely in dollars; paper reports standardized β so scale doesn’t matter for β, but it matters for unstandardized b and can affect missingness and sample if computed wrongly.  
   - **Fix:** verify the denominator used for per-capita (household size?) and how missing household size/income are treated.

---

### 4) Standard errors: mismatches and how to handle them

**Mismatch I — You implicitly claim/act like SEs exist, but the true table does not report them.**  
- **Generated:** you do not show SEs, but you do show p-values derived from SEs.  
- **True:** SEs not reported; only stars shown.  
**Fix options (pick one depending on goal):**
- **To match the paper table:** do not present SEs or p-values; present standardized β and stars only.  
- **To provide a richer replication:** you can compute SEs/p-values, but then you must explicitly say “SEs/p-values computed from replication; not shown in the original table,” and do not call them “mismatches” with the paper.

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches (what your generated output would wrongly imply)

**Mismatch J — Interpretation of Model 1 magnitude/significance vs the true table.**
- Your Model 1 education effect is negative and highly significant, consistent in direction with the paper, but **smaller** in standardized magnitude than the reported -0.322.  
- Your R² is also too low (0.088 vs 0.107), meaning your model explains less variance than the paper’s.  
**Fix:** align sample and coding; then interpret using standardized coefficients and the correct R².

**Mismatch K — You cannot interpret Models 2–3 at all.**
- Any substantive conclusion about demographic controls or political intolerance would be invalid because the models weren’t estimated.  
**Fix:** repair Hispanic coding (and any other complete-case blockers), then rerun and interpret.

---

### 6) Concrete “make it match” checklist (minimal steps)

1) **Fix `hispanic` so it is not 100% missing.**  
   - Recompute from correct source variable(s).  
   - Verify frequency table: nonmissing > 0, and proportion Hispanic plausible.

2) **Recreate Model 2 and Model 3 frames with listwise deletion** on exactly the predictors included in each model.  
   - Confirm n is near 756 (Model 2) and 503 (Model 3).

3) **Ensure the DV `num_genres_disliked` is computed identically** to the paper and only for the correct subsample (music module respondents, valid answers).

4) **Report standardized coefficients (β)** for all predictors (except intercept) to compare to Table 1.  
   - Confirm your “beta” computation matches the paper’s convention.

5) **Compare against the paper using β, R², adjusted R², and n** (not unstandardized b).  
   - Only after that, check star thresholds.

If you share your variable-construction code (especially for `hispanic`, `pol_intol`, and `num_genres_disliked`), I can pinpoint the exact coding error and the exact recode needed.
