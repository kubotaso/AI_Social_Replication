### 1) Table formatting / what is being reported (major mismatch)

**True Table 1 prints standardized coefficients only and *no standard errors*.**  
Your **Generated Results** table looks like it is trying to show **(a) standardized betas plus (b) a second line that looks like SEs**, but:

- The “second line” values (e.g., `-0.034` under Model 1) are **not standard errors** (SEs are nonnegative).  
- In `coefficients_long`, those same numbers are actually the **next coefficient (income_pc)** being printed on the next line—i.e., the table has **lost row labels and is vertically misaligned**, so it *looks* like coefficient + SE pairs but it’s actually just stacked coefficients.

**How to fix**
- If you want to match the PDF Table 1: **print only standardized coefficients** (one line per variable), **no SE column/parentheses**.
- If you want SEs anyway: you must compute them from your regression output and print them explicitly (and ensure they’re positive and in parentheses), but then your table will **not match** the published Table 1.

### 2) Variable-name mismatches (minor but important for “matching”)

These aren’t fatal statistically, but they prevent exact matching to the published table labels.

| True Table 1 label | Generated term name | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Household income per capita | `income_pc` | Different label | Rename in table output to “Household income per capita” |
| Occupational prestige | `prestg80` | Different label | Rename to “Occupational prestige” |
| Conservative Protestant | `conservative_protestant` | Different label | Rename to “Conservative Protestant” |
| No religion | `no_religion` | Different label | Rename to “No religion” |
| Political intolerance | `political_intolerance` | Matches conceptually | OK |

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I compare the **standardized coefficients** (what the true table reports). “Generated” values come from `beta_std` / the printed cells.

#### Model 1 (SES)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332 | -0.322 | -0.010 |
| Household income per capita | -0.034 | -0.037 | +0.003 |
| Occupational prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | +0.013 |

**Fix**
- These differences are small but systematic enough to suggest **your analytic sample and/or variable construction differs** from the paper’s (see Section 6 on N mismatches and likely coding differences).
- Ensure you replicate the paper’s: year/subsample restrictions, weighting (if used), and construction of DV/IVs.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.260 | -0.246 | -0.014 |
| Household income per capita | -0.051 | -0.054 | +0.003 |
| Occupational prestige | 0.007 | -0.006 | +0.013 |
| Female | -0.090 | -0.083 | -0.007 |
| Age | 0.129 | 0.140 | -0.011 |
| Black | 0.009 | 0.029 | -0.020 |
| Hispanic | 0.026 | -0.029 | +0.055 (sign flip) |
| Other race | 0.001 | 0.005 | -0.004 |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.065 | 0.059 | +0.006 |
| No religion | -0.005 | -0.012 | +0.007 |
| Southern | 0.085 | 0.097 | -0.012 |

**Big red flags here**
- **Hispanic flips sign** (generated +0.026 vs true -0.029).
- Black is much smaller in your results.
- Occupational prestige sign differs.

**Fix**
- This is usually caused by **different dummy coding / reference categories** or **different sample selection**:
  - Verify the paper’s race/ethnicity coding. Many papers use mutually exclusive categories (e.g., Hispanic is separate and may overwrite race), while your data appears to have `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` simultaneously (which can be inconsistent unless carefully defined).
  - Ensure “White non-Hispanic” is the omitted reference category if that’s what the paper uses.
  - Check whether the paper excludes small categories or codes Hispanic differently (ethnicity vs race).
- Confirm you are using the **same estimation sample** as the published table (see N mismatch below).

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance model)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.155 | -0.151 | -0.004 |
| Household income per capita | -0.016 | -0.009 | -0.007 |
| Occupational prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | +0.014 |
| Female | -0.116 | -0.095 | -0.021 |
| Age | 0.060 | 0.110 | -0.050 (large) |
| Black | -0.005 | 0.049 | -0.054 (sign flip) |
| Hispanic | 0.090 | 0.031 | +0.059 |
| Other race | 0.052 | 0.053 | -0.001 |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.051 | 0.066 | -0.015 |
| No religion | 0.017 | 0.024 | -0.007 |
| Southern | 0.090 | 0.121 | -0.031 |
| Political intolerance | 0.172 | 0.164 | +0.008 |
| R² | 0.143 | 0.169 | -0.026 |
| Adj. R² | 0.118 | 0.148 | -0.030 |
| Constant | 7.258 | 6.516 | +0.742 |
| N | 426 | 503 | -77 |

**Big red flags**
- Race effects (Black) and age are very different, and N is substantially smaller.

**Fix**
- Your `political_intolerance` has **402 missing out of 893** (per `missingness_m3`), leaving 491 nonmissing; then additional missingness drops you to 426. The paper reports **503 cases**, which implies:
  - They constructed the political intolerance scale differently (fewer missings), **or**
  - They used different missing-data rules (e.g., mean of answered items with a minimum answered threshold), **or**
  - They used imputation, **or**
  - They used a different dataset year/subset.
- To match the paper, you need to replicate *their* intolerance scale construction rules (see Section 6).

### 4) Significance-star mismatches

Because the true table prints stars based on their p-values, mismatched coefficients/samples will change stars. Concrete star mismatches:

- **Female (Model 2):** Generated `-0.090**` but True is `-0.083*` (your p-value is smaller).
- **Southern (Model 2):** Generated `0.085*` but True is `0.097**`.
- **Political intolerance (Model 3):** Generated `0.172**` but True is `0.164***` (star level differs).
- **Age (Model 3):** Generated not significant (`p=.223`) but True is `0.110*` (significant).

**Fix**
- Stars will align only after you align: **N, coding, weighting/SE method**, and the **exact model specification**.

---

### 5) “Standard errors” mismatches (conceptual)

**True table has no SEs.** Your generated table implicitly presents second-line numbers as if they were SEs, which is incorrect.

**Fix options**
1. **To match the paper**: remove SE rows entirely.  
2. **If you must show SEs**: print them in a dedicated column or in parentheses, and don’t claim they come from Table 1.

---

### 6) Fit statistics and sample size mismatches (this is likely the root cause)

#### N mismatches
- Model 1: Generated **758** vs True **787** (off by 29)
- Model 2: Generated **756** vs True **756** (matches)
- Model 3: Generated **426** vs True **503** (off by 77)

These N differences alone can easily explain coefficient and star differences—especially in Model 3.

**Fix**
- Reproduce the paper’s sample definition exactly:
  - Same survey year/subset (your diagnostics mention `N_year_1993=1606`, but the estimation dataset shown is `N_complete_music_18=893`; confirm the paper’s restriction to age 18+ and year 1993 and any other exclusions).
  - Same missing-data handling: listwise deletion vs scale construction rules.
  - Same weighting: many published OLS tables use survey weights; unweighted vs weighted can shift betas and significance.

#### R² mismatches
- Model 1: Generated 0.109 vs True 0.107 (close)
- Model 2: Generated 0.145 vs True 0.151 (moderate)
- Model 3: Generated 0.143 vs True 0.169 (large)

**Fix**
- R² for Model 3 should rise once you recover the missing cases and align the intolerance scale construction and coding.

---

### 7) Interpretation mismatches / likely interpretive errors

1. **Interpreting coefficients as unstandardized vs standardized**
   - True table reports **standardized betas**.
   - Your output includes both `beta_std` and `b_raw`. If your narrative interprets `b_raw` as if it were what the table prints, that would be wrong.

   **Fix:** In the write-up, explicitly say: “Standardized OLS coefficients (beta). A 1 SD increase in X is associated with a beta SD change in number of genres disliked.”

2. **Interpreting the DV scale**
   - DV is “Number of music genres disliked” (a count-like variable). The paper still uses OLS with standardized betas.
   
   **Fix:** Don’t interpret as odds ratios or log-count effects; keep it linear/beta interpretation unless you re-estimate with Poisson/neg-bin (but then you won’t match Table 1).

---

### 8) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true table

1. **Replicate Table 1’s output format**
   - Only standardized coefficients, with stars, no SEs.
   - Use the same variable order and labels as the PDF.

2. **Match samples**
   - Force Model 1 to use the paper’s N=787 (find why you lose 29 cases: your `missingness_m1` shows missing educ/income/prestige; the paper may have different imputation/coding for SES variables).
   - Force Model 3 to use N=503 by replicating the political intolerance scale construction:
     - Determine the item set (you show `polintol_items_answered_max=15`).
     - Apply the paper’s rule for partial completion (e.g., compute mean across answered items if ≥ some threshold; your current method likely requires too much completeness).
     - Recompute the scale and re-estimate.

3. **Fix race/ethnicity coding**
   - Ensure mutually exclusive categories consistent with the paper (commonly: Black, Hispanic, Other race; White non-Hispanic omitted).
   - Verify that Hispanic respondents are not simultaneously coded as Black/Other in a way the paper didn’t allow.

4. **Check weights and design**
   - If the paper used survey weights, use the same weights in OLS and compute standardized coefficients accordingly.
   - If robust SEs were used in significance testing (even though not printed), you need that to match stars.

5. **Re-standardize correctly**
   - Standardized betas should come from either:
     - running OLS on standardized X and standardized Y, or
     - transforming coefficients using SDs from the estimation sample.
   - Make sure the SDs come from the **same analytic sample per model** (listwise after exclusions), or your betas will drift.

If you paste the code you used to (a) build `political_intolerance` and (b) create the race/ethnicity dummies, I can point to the exact line(s) causing the N=426 and the Hispanic/Black sign problems and specify the exact recode/scale rule to match the paper’s Table 1.
