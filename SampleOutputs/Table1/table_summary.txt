## Data source(s) relevant to Table 1
- **General Social Survey (GSS), 1993**, NORC (national probability sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults).
- **Music dislikes module (1993 Culture module):** 18 music genres rated on a 5-point Likert scale (“like very much” … “dislike very much”).
- Table 1 analytic sample sizes vary by model because of missing data and because the political intolerance battery was asked of **~2/3 of the sample**.

## Table 1 dependent variable (DV)
**Musical exclusiveness** = *count of music genres disliked*  
- Constructed by counting “**dislike**” + “**dislike very much**” across **18 genres**.
- **“Don’t know” treated as missing**; respondents with any missing on the 18 items are dropped for that DV construction → smaller N.
- Stated distribution for the exclusiveness scale (in Measures section): mean **5.78**, SD **3.76**, range **0–18**.

## Table 1 statistical method
- **OLS regression** with **standardized coefficients (β)** reported.
- **Two-tailed significance tests** with thresholds: * p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001.
- Model fit reported: **R²** and **Adjusted R²**.
- Table title: “Standardized OLS Coefficients from the Regression of the Number of Music Genres Disliked on Measures of Socioeconomic Status, Group Identities, and Political Intolerance: GSS 1993.”

# Table 1: variables and regression models

## Model set-up
All three models use the same DV: **# of music genres disliked**.

### Model 1: **SES Model** (N = 787; R² = .107; Adj R² = .104)
**IVs included**
1. **Education (years)**: β = **−.322***  
2. **Household income per capita**: β = −.037 (n.s.)  
3. **Occupational prestige**: β = .016 (n.s.)  
- Constant = 10.920

**Interpretation of purpose (per text):** tests SES-based hypotheses (education/income/prestige) about musical exclusiveness.

### Model 2: **Demographic Model** (N = 756; R² = .151; Adj R² = .139)
Includes SES variables + demographic/group identity controls:

**SES variables**
1. **Education (years)**: β = **−.246***  
2. **Household income per capita**: β = −.054 (n.s.)  
3. **Occupational prestige**: β = −.006 (n.s.)

**Demographic / group identity variables**
4. **Female**: β = **−.083***  
5. **Age**: β = **.140***  
6. **Black**: β = .029 (n.s.)  
7. **Hispanic**: β = −.029 (n.s.)  
8. **Other race**: β = .005 (n.s.)  
9. **Conservative Protestant**: β = .059 (n.s.)  
10. **No religion**: β = −.012 (n.s.)  
11. **Southern**: β = **.097**  
- Constant = 8.507

---

### Model 3: **Political Intolerance Model** (N = 503; R² = .169; Adj R² = .148)
Includes the Demographic Model variables + political intolerance:

**SES variables**
1. **Education (years)**: β = **−.151**  
2. **Household income per capita**: β = −.009 (n.s.)  
3. **Occupational prestige**: β = −.022 (n.s.)

**Demographic / group identity variables**
4. **Female**: β = **−.095***  
5. **Age**: β = **.110***  
6. **Black**: β = .049 (n.s.)  
7. **Hispanic**: β = .031 (n.s.)  
8. **Other race**: β = .053 (n.s.)  
9. **Conservative Protestant**: β = .066 (n.s.)  
10. **No religion**: β = .024 (n.s.)  
11. **Southern**: β = **.121**  

**Political attitude variable**
12. **Political intolerance (0–15 count scale)**: β = **.164***  
- Constant = 6.516

### Education / SES measures
- **Education:** years of schooling.
- **Household income per capita:** income adjusted per person (paper’s term; exact construction not further detailed in Table 1).
- **Occupational prestige:** prestige score (scale not specified in Table 1 text excerpt).

### Political intolerance scale (used in Model 3)
- **Count (0–15)** of intolerant responses to 15 items: 5 target groups × 3 civil-liberty contexts (speech, teach at college, book in library).
- Target groups: anti-religion, racist (believes Blacks genetically inferior), communist, military-rule advocate, homosexual.
- Reliability: **alpha ≈ .9163** (as reported).
- Asked of **two-thirds** of sample → smaller N in Model 3.

### Demographic/group identity indicators
- Sex: **Female** dummy.
- **Age** (years).
- Race/ethnicity dummies: **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race** (reference appears to be White non-Hispanic, implied).
- Religion dummies: **Conservative Protestant**, **No religion** (reference category not shown in table; likely other religions).
- Region: **Southern** dummy.

If you want, I can also (a) rewrite Table 1 in a clean “model equation” format, or (b) extract Table 2/3 and the logistic models used for Figure 1, since they are explicitly “related” to Table 1’s core DV and theory.
