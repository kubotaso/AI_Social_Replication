## Data source(s) used for Table 1 (and directly related analyses)
- **Primary dataset:** **1993 General Social Survey (GSS)**, NORC (noninstitutionalized U.S. adults; stratified random sample).
- **Music module:** 18 music genres each rated on a **5-point Likert scale** from *“like very much”* to *“dislike very much”*, plus “don’t know”/missing.
- **Analytic sample for Table 1:** varies by model due to missingness and (for political tolerance) split-ballot:
  - SES Model: **N = 787**
  - Demographic Model: **N = 756**
  - Political Intolerance Model: **N = 503** (tolerance questions asked of ~2/3 sample)

## Table 1: Dependent variable (outcome)
**Musical exclusiveness** = **count of music genres disliked**  
- Constructed as the number of genres (out of 18) rated **“dislike”** or **“dislike very much.”**
- “Don’t know” treated as missing; cases with any DK on the 18 items are excluded from that scale construction (author reports 912 valid cases for the full exclusiveness scale; Table 1 model Ns are lower after adding covariates / split ballot).

## Table 1: Regression models and variables
Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** from **OLS regressions** where DV = *number of music genres disliked*.

### Model 1: **SES Model** (tests SES predictors)
**DV:** number of music genres disliked (count 0–18)

**IVs:**
- **Education** (years)
- **Household income per capita**
- **Occupational prestige**

### Model 2: **Demographic Model** (SES + demographic/group identities)
**DV:** number of music genres disliked

**IVs:**
- **Education** (years)
- **Household income per capita**
- **Occupational prestige**
- **Female** (indicator)
- **Age** (continuous)
- **Black** (indicator)
- **Hispanic** (indicator)
- **Other race** (indicator)
- **Conservative Protestant** (indicator)
- **No religion** (indicator)
- **Southern** (indicator)

### Model 3: **Political Intolerance Model** (adds political intolerance)
**DV:** number of music genres disliked

**IVs:**
- **Education** (years)
- **Household income per capita**
- **Occupational prestige**
- **Female**
- **Age**
- **Black**
- **Hispanic**
- **Other race**
- **Conservative Protestant**
- **No religion**
- **Southern**
- **Political intolerance** (scale)

## “Related” measures referenced around Table 1 (key constructs)
Even though not in Table 1, these are conceptually and empirically adjacent in the paper:

### Political intolerance scale (enters Table 1 Model 3)
- **Construction:** count of **intolerant** responses across **15 dichotomous items** (3 civil-liberties permissions × 5 target groups).
- **Target groups:** anti-religion; believes Blacks genetically inferior; Communist; advocates military rule; homosexual.
- **Range:** 0–15; mean 5.24; SD 4.72; **α = .9163**.

### Musical taste items underlying exclusiveness DV
- 18 genres (listed in Table 3): Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Reggae, Swing/Big band, New age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Easy listening, Contemporary rock, Pop, Rap, Heavy metal, Country/Western, Gospel.

## Statistical methods used for Table 1
- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression**
- Reported coefficients are **standardized (beta) coefficients**
- Model fit: **R² and adjusted R²**
- Significance: two-tailed tests with thresholds (* p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001)

If you want, I can also extract the **exact β estimates** shown in Table 1 for each covariate (education, age, southern, etc.) and present them in a tidy model-comparison table.
