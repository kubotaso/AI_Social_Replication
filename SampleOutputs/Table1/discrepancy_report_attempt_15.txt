Score: 35/100
============================================================

### 1) Core reporting discrepancy: the generated table mixes **standardized coefficients** with **(unlabeled) extra rows that look like SEs**
- **True Table 1**: prints **standardized coefficients only** (β), **no standard errors**.
- **Generated `table1_style`**: shows **three numbers per model for the first variables** (e.g., `-0.332***`, then `-0.034`, then `0.029`), and later shows many `NaN`s. Those second/third lines are **not SEs** (they match other coefficients like income, prestige) and the whole layout is misaligned.

**Fix**
- Decide on one output style:
  1) **Match the PDF**: print only standardized coefficients (and stars) and omit SEs entirely.  
  2) If you want SEs, you must compute them from the model output and present them explicitly as `(SE)` on the same row—**but then it will not match the PDF**.

## 2) Variable-name mismatches (and how to align)

| True Table 1 variable name | Generated term | Status | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Household income per capita | `income_pc` | OK conceptually, name differs | Rename in table output to **“Household income per capita”** |
| Occupational prestige | `prestg80` | OK conceptually, name differs | Rename in table output to **“Occupational prestige”** |
| Conservative Protestant | `conservative_protestant` | OK conceptually, name differs | Rename in output label |
| No religion | `no_religion` | OK conceptually, name differs | Rename in output label |
| Political intolerance | `political_intolerance` | OK conceptually, name differs | Rename in output label |
| Dependent variable | `num_genres_disliked` | **Mismatch** with true DV name | Relabel DV to **“Number of music genres disliked”** in text/table |

No evidence of *wrong* variables being included (the sets match), but the **printed names** do not match the PDF’s labels.

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas): every place generated ≠ true

Below I compare **standardized coefficients** (β). “Generated” comes from `coefficients_long.beta_std` (and the `cell` column). “True” comes from the PDF table.

### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.322*** | -0.332*** | too negative by ~0.010 |
| Household income per capita | -0.037 | -0.034 | slightly less negative |
| Occupational prestige | 0.016 | 0.029 | too positive |
| Constant | 10.920 | 11.086 | mismatch (also constants shouldn’t be “standardized”) |
| R² | 0.107 | 0.1088 | mismatch |
| Adj R² | 0.104 | 0.1052 | mismatch |
| N | 787 | 758 | **large mismatch** |

### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.246*** | -0.302*** | **substantially too negative** |
| Income | -0.054 | -0.057 | small mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.006 | -0.007 | small mismatch |
| Female | -0.083* | -0.078 (p≈.061, star placement differs) | sign ok; **sig differs** |
| Age | 0.140*** | 0.109* | **too small; sig too weak** |
| Black | 0.029 | 0.053 | too large |

| Conservative Protestant | 0.059 | 0.040 | too small |
| No religion | -0.012 | -0.016 | small mismatch |
| Southern | 0.097** | 0.079 (p≈.061) | **too small; sig differs** |
| Constant | 8.507 | 10.089 | large mismatch |

| Adj R² | 0.139 | 0.139 | basically matches |
| N | 756 | 523 | **huge mismatch** |

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.151** | -0.155* | magnitude close; **sig differs** |
| Income | -0.009 | -0.075 | **very wrong** |
| Prestige | -0.022 | 0.015 | **sign differs** |
| Female | -0.095* | -0.117* | too negative |

| Black | 0.049 | 0.065 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.031 | 0.018 | mismatch |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.034 | mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.066 | 0.002 | **very wrong** |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.023 | matches closely |
| Southern | 0.121** | 0.079 | too small; sig differs |
| Political intolerance | 0.164*** | 0.211*** | too large |
| Constant | 6.516 | 7.237 | mismatch |
| R² | 0.169 | 0.150 | mismatch |
| Adj R² | 0.148 | 0.119 | mismatch |
| N | 503 | 343 | **huge mismatch** |

## 4) Standard errors: generated output implies SEs exist, but true table has none
- The true results explicitly say: **no SEs are reported in Table 1**.
- The generated results show `b_raw` and `p_raw` and stars; but **no SE column is shown**, and the `table1_style` appears to put extra numbers underneath coefficients without labeling them.

**Fix**
- To match the true table: **remove standard errors entirely** and do not imply they exist.
- If you computed models yourself and want SEs: present them clearly, but then you must stop claiming it matches Table 1.

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches
Even where coefficients are close, the **star levels don’t match**:

Examples:
- **Model 3 Education**: true `-0.151**`; generated `-0.155*` (p-level disagreement).
- **Model 2 Age**: true `0.140***`; generated `0.109*` (both magnitude and inference disagreement).
- **Model 2 Southern**: true `0.097**`; generated `0.079` (p≈.061) (inference disagreement).

**Fix**
- If the goal is to reproduce the PDF table, you must replicate:
  - the **same sample**,  
  - the **same variable construction/coding**, and  
  - the **same standardization method** used by the authors (and possibly survey weights / design corrections if used).
- Then compute stars using the **same two-tailed thresholds** (the thresholds you list match the PDF, but your p-values don’t because the underlying estimates don’t match).

---

## 6) The biggest substantive problem: **estimation sample sizes don’t match the true table**
True Ns: **787 / 756 / 503**  
Generated Ns: **758 / 523 / 343**

That alone guarantees different coefficients, constants, R², and p-values.

**Likely causes (based on your diagnostics)**
- **Over-restrictive complete-case filtering**, especially in Models 2 and 3.
  - Your diagnostics show: `hispanic_nonmissing = 612` and `polintol_nonmissing = 581`, but Model 3 complete cases drop to **343**, meaning you are losing many rows due to missingness in *some other* covariates or due to how the scale was built.
- Possible **coding to NaN** when constructing dummies (race/religion/region) or political intolerance items, producing unnecessary missingness.

**Fix**
1) Recreate the **exact inclusion rules** from the paper:
   - Use the same year/subsample restrictions (you show `N_year_1993=1606`, but the paper’s analytic Ns are much larger than your complete-case Ns, especially for M2/M3).
2) Handle missing data the way the paper did:
   - If the authors used **listwise deletion**, it should still yield their Ns; your listwise deletion is happening on a *different set of variables* (or with more NAs created by recoding).
   - If the authors used **imputation** or **pairwise** strategies, implement that.
3) Verify each variable’s missingness **after** recodes:
   - Check `is.na()` counts for every regressor used in each model and ensure you’re not accidentally making valid codes missing (e.g., treating “0”/“8”/“9” as NA incorrectly or vice versa).

---

## 7) Constants and R² mismatch: symptomatic of wrong sample and/or wrong DV scale
- Constants differ a lot in Models 2 and 3 (e.g., true 8.507 vs generated 10.089).
- R² differs (true Model 3 R² .169 vs generated .150).

**Fix**
- Ensure the **dependent variable is identical**:
  - The paper DV is **“Number of music genres disliked.”**
  - Confirm you built it from the same genre items, same coding (what counts as “disliked”), and same handling of “don’t know / not asked / missing”.
- Ensure the same **standardization approach**:
  - Standardized coefficients in OLS typically: run OLS on **z-scored X and z-scored Y** (or equivalently scale via SDs). If you standardized only X but not Y, βs will be off.
  - Use the same SD definition (sample SD, not population) and same sample used for SD computation (must match the model sample).

---

## 8) Specific red flags pointing to construction/coding errors
These are too large to be just rounding:

- **Model 3 income**: true β = **-0.009**; generated β = **-0.075**  
  Suggests your income variable in Model 3 is behaving differently than in the paper (or you standardized on a much smaller/biased sample, or income got transformed/capped differently).
- **Model 3 prestige**: true β = **-0.022**; generated β = **+0.015** (sign flip)
- **Model 2 other_race**: true β = **+0.005**; generated β = **-0.016** (sign flip)
- **Model 3 conservative_protestant**: true β = **0.066**; generated β = **0.002** (essentially gone)

**Fix**
- Re-check reference categories and dummy construction:
  - Race: confirm what “Other race” is relative to (likely White as reference). A sign flip can come from changing the reference group or misclassification.
  - Religion: confirm “Conservative Protestant” coding aligns with the paper’s definition; denominational classification differences commonly cause big discrepancies.
- Confirm political intolerance scale:
  - Your `political_intolerance` ranges include values like 0–7 in the sample printout; the diagnostic says mean items answered ~9.77, suggesting a multi-item additive scale. If your scale differs from the authors’ (items included, direction, rescaling), coefficients and N will diverge.

## 9) What to change in the generated reporting so it matches the PDF exactly
To make the generated analysis match the *true printed Table 1*:

1) **Output only standardized coefficients** (β) with stars; remove SEs/p-values from the displayed table (you can keep them internally).
2) Use the **exact row order and labels** from Table 1 (Education, Household income per capita, etc.).
3) Ensure each model uses the **paper’s N** (787/756/503). Do not proceed until Ns match.
4) Recompute standardized coefficients on the **final estimation sample for each model** using the same standardization convention as the authors.
5) Adjust significance stars to match the paper’s thresholds (two-tailed), but once Ns and coefficients match, stars should follow automatically.

If you share (a) your code for variable construction (DV + political intolerance + religion/race coding) and (b) a missingness table by variable for each model, I can pinpoint exactly which recode/filter is causing the N collapse and the sign flips.
