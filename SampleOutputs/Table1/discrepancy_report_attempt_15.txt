Score: 11/100
============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: **n, R², adjusted R² all mismatch (Models 2–3; n also mismatches in Model 1)**

**Model 1 (SES)**
- **Generated:** n = **793**, R² = **0.107613**, adj R² = **0.104220**
- **True:** n = **787**, R² = **0.107**, adj R² = **0.104**
- **Mismatch:** **n** is off by **+6**. R²/adj R² are essentially consistent (rounding differences only).

**Fix**
- Ensure Model 1 uses the same analytic sample as the paper (listwise deletion rules, same exclusions). Your `model_frames` shows 793 rows; the paper uses 787. Something about your filtering/imputation is retaining extra cases the paper dropped.

**Model 2 (Demographic)**
- **Generated:** n = **48**, R² = **0.439051**, adj R² = **0.287444**
- **True:** n = **756**, R² = **0.151**, adj R² = **0.139**
- **Mismatch:** catastrophic. Sample size is wrong by **-708**, and R² is far too high.

**Fix**
- Your Model 2 frame is only **48 rows**—you are inadvertently restricting to a tiny subset (e.g., accidental merge, dropping almost everything due to missing coding, using only complete cases after *incorrectly creating dummies*, or filtering to respondents with non-missing on a variable that shouldn’t be required).
- Rebuild Model 2 using the paper’s full GSS 1993 sample and the same missing-data handling.
- Verify each predictor’s missingness and coding before listwise deletion. A common error: generating a dummy that becomes missing for most cases (e.g., religion coding), then dropping NAs.

**Model 3 (Political intolerance)**
- **Generated:** n = **26**, R² = **0.425546**, adj R² = **0.042577**
- **True:** n = **503**, R² = **0.169**, adj R² = **0.148**
- **Mismatch:** again catastrophic. n is wrong by **-477**, and fit stats are meaningless given the tiny n.

**Fix**
- Same as Model 2, plus: your `pol_intol` variable seems to exist for very few cases (or you created it in a way that makes most rows NA).
- Recreate the political intolerance scale exactly as in the paper (same items, same response coding, same allowable range), then apply the paper’s missing-data rule (often “at least k items answered” vs “all items answered”).

---

### 2) Coefficients: **you are not matching what the paper reports (standardized β), and many signs/magnitudes are wrong**

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except constants). Your generated output appears to be **unstandardized OLS slopes** (raw units), which makes the numbers incomparable even if the model were otherwise correct.

**Fix (global)**
- To match Table 1: compute **standardized coefficients**:
  - Either run OLS on **z-scored** variables (DV and all IVs), *but keep in mind the constant then becomes ~0* (paper keeps unstandardized constant, so that approach won’t replicate constants).
  - Or: run the unstandardized regression and then convert slopes to β via  
    \[
    \beta_j = b_j \times \frac{s_{x_j}}{s_y}
    \]
  - Keep the **constant from the unstandardized model** (as the paper does).

Because your models are also using the wrong samples (n=48, n=26), even standardizing won’t fix the substantive discrepancies until you fix the sample.

---

### 3) Variable name mismatches (and likely coding mismatches)

**Education**
- **Generated name:** `Education (years)` / `educ_yrs`
- **True name:** Education
- Name itself is fine, but **content must match**: the paper’s coefficient is standardized β; yours is raw.

**Household income per capita**
- **Generated:** `inc_pc`
- **True:** Household income per capita
- Again, probably OK conceptually, but the **sign and magnitude differ strongly in Models 2–3**, suggesting either wrong sample, wrong transformation, or not standardized.

**Occupational prestige**
- **Generated:** `prestg80`
- **True:** Occupational prestige
- In the true results, prestige is near zero/negative in Models 2–3; yours is **large positive**. That’s a red flag for either:
  - wrong sample (very likely), and/or
  - not standardized, and/or
  - prestige coding differs (e.g., reversed, different prestige measure, or mis-merge).

**Political intolerance**
- **Generated name:** `pol_intol` / `Political intolerance (0–15)`
- **True:** Political intolerance
- Your coefficient is 0.129 (no stars); true is **0.164***. With correct β scaling and sample, it may align, but right now it cannot because n=26.

**Race dummies**
- Generated includes: Black, Hispanic, Other race — but **Hispanic and Other race are NaN in Model 3**, and Other race is NaN in Model 2.
- True results include coefficients for all race indicators in Models 2–3.

**Fix**
- Your dummy construction is broken (perfect collinearity, all missing, or no variation).
- Check that:
  - race categories are mutually exclusive and correctly coded
  - one category is the reference group (likely White)
  - you are not accidentally filtering out most non-White respondents
  - you are not using string categories that fail to map consistently, creating missing values

**Religion variables**
- Generated: `Conservative Protestant`, `No religion` (dummies)
- True: same concepts, but your **Conservative Protestant coefficient is huge** in Model 2 (0.388*) vs true 0.059 (ns), implying scaling/sample/coding problems.

**Fix**
- Ensure Conservative Protestant is defined exactly like the paper (often based on religious tradition recodes, not simply “Protestant & conservative self-label”).
- Ensure “No religion” is correctly coded and not confounded with missing/“don’t know”.

**Southern**
- Generated: positive small; true: positive moderate with significance.
- This could align after fixing standardization + sample.

### 4) Coefficient mismatches model-by-model (direction, magnitude, significance)

#### Model 1 (SES)
True β vs generated b (raw):
- Education: **-0.322*** (true) vs **-0.330*** (generated)  
  - Numerically close, but this is probably accidental: yours is raw-unit slope; true is standardized β. They should not be directly comparable.
- Income pc: **-0.037** (true) vs **-0.034** (generated)  
- Prestige: **0.016** (true) vs **0.029** (generated)  
- Constant: **10.920** (true) vs **10.833** (generated)

**Fix**
- After aligning the sample to n=787 and reporting standardized β, you should match closely. Your Model 1 is the only one that looks plausibly in the right neighborhood.

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
Major mismatches (even ignoring standardization):
- Education: true **-0.246***; generated **-0.762** (and only **), wrong scale + wrong sample
- Income: true **-0.054**; generated **+0.138** (wrong sign)
- Prestige: true **-0.006**; generated **+0.426*** (wrong sign and huge)
- Female: true **-0.083***; generated **+0.010** (wrong sign, near zero)
- Age: true **+0.140***; generated **+0.045** (too small)
- Conservative Protestant: true **+0.059 (ns)**; generated **+0.388*** (too large)
- Southern: true **+0.097**; generated **+0.137** (could be plausible, but sample is wrong)
- Constant: true **8.507**; generated **7.584**

**Fix**
1. Fix sample construction (n should be 756).
2. Ensure coefficients are standardized β (except constant).
3. Verify coding of DV and key predictors (income per capita scaling, prestige variable, sex coding).
4. Re-check that you didn’t inadvertently subset to, e.g., only respondents with complete data on a derived religion variable, leaving an unrepresentative micro-sample.

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
Major mismatches:
- Education: true **-0.151**; generated **-0.266** (scale/sample issue)
- Income: true **-0.009**; generated **+0.040** (wrong sign)
- Prestige: true **-0.022**; generated **+0.212** (wrong sign)
- Female: true **-0.095**; generated **+0.126** (wrong sign)
- Age: true **+0.110**; generated **+0.192** (too large)
- Hispanic/Other race: true non-missing; generated **NaN**
- Political intolerance: true **+0.164***; generated **+0.130** (no stars)
- Constant: true **6.516**; generated **1.646** (strong evidence you are not fitting the same model/sample)

**Fix**
- Same as Model 2, plus ensure the political intolerance scale matches and is available for ~503 cases, not 26.
- Fix dummy creation so Hispanic/Other race are estimable (no NaNs).

---

### 5) Standard errors: **your generated analysis reports none, but you imply significance stars anyway**
- The *true table* does **not report standard errors**, only stars.
- Your generated output also does not list SEs, but it appears to be computing stars from some (unstated) SE/p-values.

**Mismatch**
- You cannot “match” SEs because the paper doesn’t provide them. Also, your stars currently cannot be validated against the paper unless:
  1) you use the same sample, and  
  2) you compute standardized β and p-values consistently.

**Fix**
- Either (a) remove SEs entirely and only report β + stars, or (b) explicitly compute and report SEs from your model but label them as “computed; not in paper”.
- To match the paper’s stars: reproduce the same model specification and sample; then compute p-values (likely two-tailed t-tests), and apply the same thresholds.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatches (implicit, but guaranteed given sign flips)
Several predictors flip sign relative to the true results (income, prestige, female in Models 2–3). Any narrative interpretation based on your generated results would be wrong.

**Fix**
- Do not interpret Model 2–3 coefficients until:
  - n matches (756, 503),
  - variables are coded correctly,
  - coefficients are standardized to β.

---

## Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Recreate the analytic samples**
   - Model 1: expect **n=787**
   - Model 2: expect **n=756**
   - Model 3: expect **n=503**
   - Implement the same listwise deletion rules as the paper (and confirm each added block reduces n appropriately).

2. **Verify DV**
   - Ensure `num_genres_disliked` matches the paper’s construction (same genres included, same missing handling).

3. **Recode predictors to match the paper**
   - Education: same metric (years) and treatment of missing.
   - Income per capita: same transformation/deflation/top-coding if used.
   - Prestige: same prestige scale and coding direction.
   - Female: confirm 1=female coding and that reference is male.
   - Race: correct mutually-exclusive dummies; White as reference.
   - Religion: confirm “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” definitions match the paper’s scheme.
   - Southern: confirm region coding.

4. **Report standardized coefficients (β)**
   - Convert unstandardized slopes to β using SD ratios, while keeping the unstandardized constant.

5. **Stars**
   - Compute p-values from the correctly specified model and apply the same thresholds (*, **, ***).
   - Expect stars to align with the paper once the sample/spec match.

If you paste your code (especially how you build `model_frames`, dummies, and `pol_intol`), I can pinpoint exactly why you’re collapsing to n=48 and n=26 and why Hispanic/Other race become NaN.
