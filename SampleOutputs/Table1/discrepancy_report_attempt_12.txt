Score: 29/100
============================================================

### 1) Outcome/label mismatch (interpretation)
- **True table DV:** *Number of music genres disliked*.
- **Generated output DV name in data:** `exclusiveness` (and the models are labeled “Political intolerance” etc., but DV is not printed).
- **Why this matters:** If `exclusiveness` is not *exactly* the “# genres disliked” variable used in the PDF, then *all coefficients, N, and fit stats won’t match* even if the RHS is correct.

**Fix**
- Verify the DV construction matches the PDF definition (same items, same coding, same missing-data rules).
- In code: explicitly create and label the DV as the PDF does (e.g., `genres_disliked_count`) and run all models on that.

### 2) Variable name mismatches (table labels)
These are mostly cosmetic, but they also hint you may not be using the same operationalization/coding.

| True Table 1 name | Generated term | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Household income per capita | `inc_pc` | Name differs (ok), but check scaling/definition | Ensure it is truly per-capita household income, same transformation (none/log), same year dollars, same trimming |
| Occupational prestige | `prestg80` | Likely correct GSS prestige score, but verify matches PDF | Use same prestige measure and handling of DK/NA |
| Conservative Protestant | `conserv_prot` | Name differs; coding must match | Match the PDF’s religious tradition classification exactly |
| No religion | `no_religion` | Name differs; coding must match | Ensure this equals “none” (and not including DK/other) exactly as in paper |
| Southern | `south` | Name differs; coding must match | Ensure “South” definition matches paper (Census region vs self-report) |
| Political intolerance | `polintol` | Name differs; construction must match | Match the paper’s index/scale construction and item availability rules |

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)
The **true table reports standardized coefficients (betas)**. Your generated “table1_style” appears to be **betas**, but many values don’t match.

Below are **every coefficient mismatch** (Generated beta vs True beta):

#### Model 1 (SES)
- **Education:** Gen **-0.332** vs True **-0.322** (too negative by -0.010)
- **Income pc:** Gen **-0.034** vs True **-0.037** (off by +0.003)
- **Occ prestige:** Gen **0.029** vs True **0.016** (too large by +0.013)

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Education:** Gen **-0.302** vs True **-0.246** (major mismatch)
- **Income pc:** Gen **-0.057** vs True **-0.054** (close, still mismatch)
- **Occ prestige:** Gen **-0.007** vs True **-0.006** (close)
- **Female:** Gen **-0.078** vs True **-0.083** (close)
- **Age:** Gen **0.109** vs True **0.140** (noticeable mismatch)
- **Black:** Gen **0.053** vs True **0.029** (mismatch)
- **Hispanic:** Gen **-0.017** vs True **-0.029** (mismatch)
- **Other race:** Gen **-0.016** vs True **0.005** (**sign mismatch**)
- **Conservative Protestant:** Gen **0.040** vs True **0.059** (mismatch)
- **No religion:** Gen **-0.016** vs True **-0.012** (small mismatch)
- **Southern:** Gen **0.079** vs True **0.097** (mismatch)

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Education:** Gen **-0.157** vs True **-0.151** (close)
- **Income pc:** Gen **-0.067** vs True **-0.009** (**large mismatch**)
- **Occ prestige:** Gen **-0.008** vs True **-0.022** (mismatch)
- **Female:** Gen **-0.118** vs True **-0.095** (mismatch)
- **Age:** Gen **0.092** vs True **0.110** (mismatch)
- **Black:** Gen **0.004** vs True **0.049** (**large mismatch**)
- **Hispanic:** Gen **0.091** vs True **0.031** (mismatch)
- **Other race:** Gen **0.053** vs True **0.053** (**matches**)
- **Conserv Protestant:** Gen **-0.011** vs True **0.066** (**sign mismatch**)
- **No religion:** Gen **0.018** vs True **0.024** (small mismatch)
- **Southern:** Gen **0.073** vs True **0.121** (mismatch)
- **Political intolerance:** Gen **0.196** vs True **0.164** (mismatch)

**Fix (for coefficient mismatches)**
These gaps are too large to be rounding. The usual causes:
1. **Different estimation sample** (your N’s are much smaller; see §5).  
2. **Different variable construction** (esp. `polintol`, income per capita, religion, region).  
3. **Different standardization method** (see §4).  
4. **Different year/subsample** (you show `N_year_1993 = 1606`, suggesting you filtered to 1993; confirm the PDF did the same and used the same inclusion rules).

To fix, you need to replicate the PDF’s:
- sample restrictions,
- missing-data handling,
- variable coding,
- and standardization convention.

### 4) Standard errors: generated vs “true”
- **True results:** explicitly state **Table 1 does not print SEs**.
- **Generated table:** prints a second row under each coefficient that *looks like SEs* (e.g., educ has `-0.034` under it in Model 1), and the `coefficients_long` has `p_raw`, implying SEs exist internally.

**Mismatch**
- You cannot claim “Table 1 coefficients with standard errors” if the PDF table provides no SEs.

**Fix**
- Remove SEs from the “generated vs true” comparison table. If you want SEs, you must:
  - compute them from the microdata regression output, and
  - clearly label them as *computed from data*, not “as printed in Table 1”.
- Also ensure you are not mixing **standardized betas** with **SEs from unstandardized coefficients**. If you standardize variables and run OLS, SEs correspond to standardized coefficients; if you compute betas post-hoc, SEs won’t match the printed betas.

---

### 5) N, R², Adjusted R², Constant: all mismatch
#### Sample size (major discrepancy)
- **True N:** M1 **787**, M2 **756**, M3 **503**
- **Generated N:** M1 **758**, M2 **523**, M3 **293**

That is not a minor difference—your Model 2 and 3 samples are dramatically smaller, which alone explains why coefficients and R² diverge.

**Fix**
- Replicate the paper’s **missing-data policy**. Commonly the paper uses listwise deletion *within each model* but with less restrictive construction than yours.
- Your diagnostics show:  
  - `N_complete_music_items = 893`, but your M1 is 758 (so you’re dropping many additional cases).  
  - `N_polintol_complete15 = 491`, but your M3 is 293 (you’re dropping even more—likely due to requiring nonmissing on many RHS vars or constructing polintol with stricter rules than the paper).

Actionable fixes:
- Don’t over-restrict polintol (e.g., requiring all 15 items nonmissing if the paper used fewer items or allowed partial scales).
- Ensure race/religion variables aren’t introducing missingness (e.g., treating “don’t know” as missing when paper recoded).
- Check whether the paper used **imputation** or **valid skip recodes** rather than dropping.

#### R² / Adjusted R² mismatch
- **True R²:** 0.107 / 0.151 / 0.169
- **Generated R²:** 0.109 / 0.157 / 0.152  
Model 3 R² is notably lower than true, consistent with your much smaller/altered sample and/or different polintol construction.

**Fix**
- Once N and variable construction match, R² should align closely.

#### Constant mismatch
- **True constants:** 10.920 / 8.507 / 6.516
- **Generated constants:** 11.086 / 10.089 / 7.583

Because constants depend on:
- the **unstandardized model**,
- the **coding and scaling** of predictors,
- and the **sample mean of DV**,  
these discrepancies again point to **different DV and/or sample**.

**Fix**
- Use the identical DV and coding.
- Confirm whether the paper’s “constant” came from an **unstandardized regression** while printing standardized betas for predictors (a common practice). If you standardized variables *before* fitting, your intercept will not match.
  - To match the paper: run OLS on original scales, then compute standardized betas separately for reporting.

---

### 6) Significance stars / interpretation mismatches
Because your p-values come from your (different) model, your stars don’t match the printed ones.

Examples:
- **Model 3 political intolerance:** Gen `**` but True `***`.
- **Model 3 education:** Gen `*` but True `**`.
- **Model 2 age:** Gen `*` but True `***`.
- **Model 2 south:** Gen no star but True `**`.

**Fix**
- First fix sample/coding/standardization so coefficients match; then the p-values/stars will usually fall into the same thresholds.
- Ensure you’re using the same test assumptions (two-tailed; alpha cutoffs match: .05/.01/.001).
- If the paper used survey weights or design-based SEs (common in GSS work), and you used plain OLS SEs, stars will differ even with identical coefficients. Match the paper’s variance estimation (weights/cluster/strata/robust).

---

### 7) Table structure mismatch (NaNs and ordering)
- Your “table1_style” has many unlabeled rows with `NaN` placeholders—so the mapping of rows to variables is ambiguous.
- The true table has explicit variable names and dashes for excluded variables.

**Fix**
- Build the output table by joining on `term` names, and print “—” for excluded variables.
- Ensure ordering matches Table 1 exactly.

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true Table 1
1. **Confirm DV** equals “number of music genres disliked” (same items, coding, and missingness rules). Don’t rely on `exclusiveness` unless verified identical.
2. **Replicate the paper’s sample restrictions** (year(s), age range, etc.) and **missing-data handling** per model to hit **N = 787 / 756 / 503**.
3. **Match variable construction** exactly:
   - per-capita income definition and any transforms,
   - religious tradition classification for “Conservative Protestant”,
   - region definition for “South”,
   - political intolerance index construction (items used, scaling, allowed partial completion).
4. **Standardization convention:** run **unstandardized OLS** (to match constants) and compute **standardized betas** for reporting, or use the exact same method the authors used.
5. **Inference method:** if the paper used weights/robust/survey design, replicate that; otherwise stars won’t align.
6. **Remove SEs from “as printed”** outputs (since Table 1 doesn’t print them) or clearly label them as recomputed from microdata.

If you paste (a) the paper’s variable construction notes for `polintol` and the DV, and (b) your exact model-fitting code (including any filtering), I can pinpoint which specific filter/coding step is causing the N collapse in Models 2–3 and the sign flips (e.g., conservative Protestant).
