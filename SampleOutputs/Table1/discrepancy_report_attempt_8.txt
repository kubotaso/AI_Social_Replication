============================================================

Below is an item-by-item audit of **every mismatch** between the Generated Results and the True (printed) Table 1, covering **variable names/inclusion, standardized coefficients, constants, N, R²/Adj. R², and interpretation/significance**—plus what you must change to make the generated analysis match the printed results.

---

## 1) Fit statistics: N, R², Adjusted R² (all three models mismatch)

### Model 1 (SES)
- **Generated:** N=757, R²=0.099847, Adj R²=0.096261  
- **True:** N=787, R²=0.107, Adj R²=0.104  
**Mismatch:** All three values differ.

**How to fix**
- You are not using the same analytic sample as the paper.
- Reproduce the paper’s **listwise deletion rules for Model 1 only** (i.e., include cases complete on DV + educ + income per capita + occupational prestige).
- Verify you’re using the same DV coding (“number of music genres disliked”) and same missing-value handling (e.g., GSS style missing codes like 8/9 → NA).
- After aligning the sample and coding, rerun OLS and recompute R²/Adj R².

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **Generated:** N=755, R²=0.136478, Adj R²=0.124872; “dropped_no_variance: hispanic”
- **True:** N=756, R²=0.151, Adj R²=0.139  
**Mismatch:** N, R², Adj R² all differ. Also you dropped *hispanic* entirely.

**How to fix**
- **Do not drop `hispanic`.** In the true table it is included and has a nonzero coefficient (-0.029).
- Your “dropped_no_variance” indicates that in your estimation sample `hispanic` became constant (all 0 or all 1), which almost always means **you filtered the sample incorrectly** (e.g., subset to a group, merged badly, or recoded race/ethnicity incorrectly).
- Recheck:
  - coding of `hispanic` (should vary in the full sample used for Model 2),
  - whether you inadvertently restricted to non-Hispanics via earlier recodes,
  - whether `hispanic` overlaps with race dummies and you accidentally set it to missing except one value.
- Align the sample to the paper’s Model 2 listwise deletion (DV + all Model 2 covariates).

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **Generated:** N=426, R²=0.139402, Adj R²=0.116536; dropped hispanic again
- **True:** N=503, R²=0.169, Adj R²=0.148  
**Mismatch:** N, R², Adj R² all differ; `hispanic` wrongly excluded.

**How to fix**
- Same as Model 2 **plus** ensure `polintol` is coded and missingness handled the same way as the paper.
- Your N is far too small (426 vs 503), suggesting you are dropping many observations due to:
  - overly strict complete-case requirements (possibly including extra variables not in the paper),
  - incorrect NA conversion (e.g., treating valid categories as missing),
  - constructing `polintol` incorrectly (e.g., requiring all items non-missing when paper uses an average over available items, or uses a specific scale rule).

---

## 2) Variable inclusion / naming discrepancies (major)

### A) `hispanic` incorrectly excluded in Models 2 and 3
- **Generated coefficients_long:** `hispanic included=False` with NaN coefficient in both Model 2 and 3
- **True:** `Hispanic` included in both models (β = -0.029; β = 0.031)

**How to fix**
- Fix the `hispanic` variable so it varies in the estimation sample.
- Do **not** auto-drop it for “no variance”; treat that as a diagnostic that your preprocessing/sample is wrong.

### B) `other_race` sign mismatch in Model 2 suggests coding mismatch
- **Generated Model 2:** other_race β = **-0.008**
- **True Model 2:** Other race β = **+0.005**
This is small, but the sign flip is still a mismatch and often signals different reference categories or different construction.

**How to fix**
- Confirm race/ethnicity dummy construction matches the paper:
  - What is the omitted/reference group? Usually White non-Hispanic.
  - Ensure you did not combine Hispanic into race categories differently than the authors.
  - Ensure `other_race` is defined as in the paper (not e.g. “non-Black non-White” including Hispanic).

## 3) Standardized coefficients (β) mismatches (by variable)

Your `table1_style_betas` appears to be standardized betas, so compare them to the “True” standardized coefficients.

### Model 1 (SES): all three predictors mismatch
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.316*** | -0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| HH income pc | -0.035 | -0.037 | slightly off |
| Occ prestige | +0.025 | +0.016 | too large |

**How to fix**
- Once the **sample** matches (N=787) and variable coding matches, these should align closely.
- If still off after sample alignment, the standardization method may differ:
  - Standardized beta for OLS should be computed using **sample SDs used in that model**.
  - Make sure you’re using the same SD definition (population vs sample SD rarely matters much, but can nudge results).
  - Confirm you didn’t standardize using full-data SDs instead of model-specific complete-case SDs.

### Model 2 (Demographic): multiple mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.245*** | -0.246*** | close |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | off |
| Occ prestige | +0.003 | -0.006 | sign mismatch |
| Female | -0.091** | -0.083* | magnitude + significance mismatch |
| Age | +0.127*** | +0.140*** | too small |
| Black | +0.031 | +0.029 | close |
| Hispanic | dropped | -0.029 | missing entirely |
| Other race | -0.008 | +0.005 | sign mismatch |
| Conserv Prot | +0.067 | +0.059 | off |
| No religion | -0.004 | -0.012 | off |
| South | +0.081* | +0.097** | magnitude + significance mismatch |

**How to fix**
- Primary fixes:
  1) restore `hispanic` and correct race/ethnicity coding,
  2) match sample N=756,
  3) ensure same reference categories and dummy coding,
  4) align missing-value handling.
- Significance-star mismatches typically resolve when coefficients/SEs change due to correct sample/coding.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance): multiple mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.161** | -0.151** | too large magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.012 | -0.009 | off |
| Occ prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | too small magnitude |
| Female | -0.114* | -0.095* | off |
| Age | +0.060 | +0.110* | big mismatch (and significance mismatch) |
| Black | +0.062 | +0.049 | off |
| Hispanic | dropped | +0.031 | missing entirely |
| Other race | +0.051 | +0.053 | close |
| Conserv Prot | +0.053 | +0.066 | off |
| No religion | +0.020 | +0.024 | close-ish |
| South | +0.087 | +0.121** | magnitude + significance mismatch |
| Pol intolerance | +0.166** | +0.164*** | stars mismatch |

**How to fix**
- Biggest red flags here are **N (426 vs 503)** and **Age** (0.060 vs 0.110*). This strongly suggests your Model 3 sample and/or variable construction differs.
- Fix `polintol` construction and listwise deletion rules to reproduce N=503.
- After the sample matches, age and south effects (and polintol significance) should move toward the printed values.

---

## 4) Constants (intercepts) mismatch in all models

- **Generated constants:** 10.903; 8.659; 7.355  
- **True constants:** 10.920; 8.507; 6.516  

**How to fix**
- Intercepts are very sensitive to:
  - sample differences,
  - centering/standardizing of predictors (if you accidentally standardized before fitting, intercept changes meaning),
  - different coding of DV and covariates.
- The fact that Model 3 intercept is especially off (7.355 vs 6.516) again points to incorrect Model 3 sample and/or polintol scale.

---

## 5) Standard errors: generated output implies SEs exist, but “True Results” explicitly say none are printed

- **Generated:** you report p-values and stars (therefore you computed SEs internally).
- **True:** Table 1 **does not print standard errors**; only standardized coefficients and stars are shown.

**Mismatch in interpretation/reporting**
- If your goal is to match the printed table, you should **not claim** the table includes SEs, and you should not present SEs as “from the table.”
- You *can* compute SEs from the replication dataset/model, but then they are **replication-derived**, not extracted.

**How to fix**
- In your writeup: distinguish clearly between:
  - “Printed standardized coefficients and significance stars (from Table 1)” vs
  - “SEs/p-values computed from our replication model.”
- If the task is strict matching, present only β and stars.

---

## 6) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation-level mismatches)

Because stars differ, your interpretation would also differ. Key mismatches:

### Model 2
- **Female:** Generated ** (p<.01), True * (p<.05)
- **South:** Generated * (p<.05), True ** (p<.01)

### Model 3
- **Age:** Generated not significant, True * (p<.05)
- **South:** Generated not significant, True ** (p<.01)
- **Political intolerance:** Generated **, True ***

**How to fix**
- Stars will only match once you match:
  1) the exact estimation sample per model,
  2) variable coding (especially `hispanic`, `south`, `age`, `polintol`),
  3) the exact model specification and weights/robust SE choices (if the paper used weights or robust SEs; Table 1 doesn’t say here, but you must check the paper’s methods section/notes).

---

## 7) Extra internal-count diagnostics don’t align with the table Ns

- **Generated:** `n_dv_complete_music = 893`, `n_complete_polintol = 491`
- **True Ns used in models:** 787, 756, 503

**Mismatch**
- These diagnostics indicate you are counting “complete” differently than the authors’ model-specific listwise deletion.

**How to fix**
- Compute **model-specific complete-case Ns**:
  - Model 1 complete on (DV, educ, inc_pc, prestg80)
  - Model 2 complete on (DV + all demographics)
  - Model 3 complete on (DV + all demographics + polintol)
- Do not use a single “DV complete” N to infer model N.

---

## What you should change in your pipeline (practical checklist)

1) **Rebuild `hispanic`** so it varies and is included (no auto-drop).
2) **Recreate race/ethnicity dummies** with the same reference category as the paper (likely White non-Hispanic).
3) **Verify DV coding** (number of music genres disliked) and convert survey missing codes to NA correctly.
4) **Recreate `polintol` exactly** as the authors did (items, scaling, and missingness rule).
5) For each model, use **listwise deletion on that model’s variables only** to match Ns (787/756/503).
6) Compute **standardized coefficients** using the **same model sample SDs**.
7) Only after 1–6: compare β, R², Adj R², constant, and stars again.

If you want, paste your variable construction code (especially `hispanic`, race dummies, and `polintol`) and the exact model formulas; I can point to the specific line(s) that are forcing `hispanic` to be constant and shrinking Model 3 to N=426.
