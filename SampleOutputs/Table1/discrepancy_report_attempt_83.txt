### 1) Fit statistics (R², adj. R², N) — multiple mismatches

**Model 1 (SES)**
- **Mismatch (N):** Generated **747** vs True **787**
- **Mismatch (R²):** Generated **0.088** vs True **0.107**
- **Mismatch (Adj. R²):** Generated **0.085** vs True **0.104**

**Model 2 (Demographic)**
- **Mismatch (N):** Generated **507** vs True **756**
- **Mismatch (R²):** Generated **0.138** vs True **0.151**
- **Mismatch (Adj. R²):** Generated **0.119** vs True **0.139**

**Model 3 (Political intolerance)**
- **Mismatch (N):** Generated **286** vs True **503**
- **Mismatch (R²):** Generated **0.148** vs True **0.169**
- **Mismatch (Adj. R²):** Generated **0.114** vs True **0.148**
- **Mismatch (“dropped hispanic”):** Generated indicates **hispanic dropped**; True includes Hispanic with a coefficient.

**How to fix**
- You are not reproducing the paper’s estimation sample(s). Your code is doing **listwise deletion on your constructed variables** (and/or on variables that the paper did not treat as missing the same way), producing far smaller N—especially once `hispanic` and `pol_intol` enter.
- To match the paper, you must replicate **their exact GSS 1993 sample restrictions and missing-data handling**:
  - Use the same year filter (1993) and the same “valid responses” rules for each variable.
  - Ensure you’re using the same operationalizations (see below), because miscoding creates extra missingness.
  - If the paper used **pairwise deletion** or different imputation/recoding conventions, adopt those. (Most likely it’s still listwise, but on *different* variable definitions with fewer missings.)
- Practically: rebuild variables to match GSS coding, then recompute complete-case N; N should rise toward **787 / 756 / 503**.

### 2) Coefficients: you are mixing **unstandardized b** with **standardized β**, and β’s don’t match

The True Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** (except the constant). Your generated output contains both:
- `b` (unstandardized slope) and
- `beta` (standardized coefficient)

Your *Table1-style outputs* use the `beta` values—which is correct in principle—but many β’s differ from the true β’s.

#### Model 1 β (SES)
- **Education**
  - Generated β: **-0.292***  
  - True β: **-0.322***  → mismatch (too small in magnitude)
- **Income per capita**
  - Generated β: **-0.039**
  - True β: **-0.037** → small mismatch
- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated β: **0.020**
  - True β: **0.016** → mismatch
- **Constant**
  - Generated: **10.638**
  - True: **10.920** → mismatch

#### Model 2 β (Demographic)
- **Education**: Generated **-0.266*** vs True **-0.246*** (mismatch)
- **Income**: Generated **-0.054** vs True **-0.054** (matches)
- **Prestige**: Generated **-0.010** vs True **-0.006** (mismatch)
- **Female**: Generated **-0.089***? (star differs) vs True **-0.083***? actually True is **-0.083*** with * (p<.05) (direction ok, magnitude mismatch, star may mismatch)
- **Age**: Generated **0.102***? (only *) vs True **0.140*** (big mismatch + significance)
- **Black**: Generated **0.037** vs True **0.029** (mismatch)
- **Hispanic**: Generated **-0.033** vs True **-0.029** (mismatch)
- **Other race**: Generated **-0.027** vs True **0.005** (sign mismatch)
- **Conservative Protestant**: Generated **0.083** vs True **0.059** (mismatch)
- **No religion**: Generated **-0.018** vs True **-0.012** (mismatch)
- **Southern**: Generated **0.060** vs True **0.097** (mismatch + significance; True is **)
- **Constant**: Generated **9.663** vs True **8.507** (large mismatch)

#### Model 3 β (Political intolerance)
- **Education**: Generated **-0.157***? vs True **-0.151** (close; star mismatch: True is **)
- **Income**: Generated **-0.050** vs True **-0.009** (major mismatch)
- **Prestige**: Generated **-0.015** vs True **-0.022** (mismatch)
- **Female**: Generated **-0.126***? vs True **-0.095* ** (mismatch)
- **Age**: Generated **0.091** vs True **0.110* ** (mismatch + significance)
- **Black**: Generated **0.085** vs True **0.049** (mismatch)
- **Hispanic**: Generated blank/NA vs True **0.031** (missing entirely)
- **Other race**: Generated **0.053** vs True **0.053** (matches)
- **Conservative Protestant**: Generated **0.038** vs True **0.066** (mismatch)
- **No religion**: Generated **0.024** vs True **0.024** (matches)
- **Southern**: Generated **0.068** vs True **0.121** (mismatch + significance)
- **Political intolerance**: Generated **0.183** vs True **0.164*** (mismatch in magnitude + star)
- **Constant**: Generated **7.635** vs True **6.516** (mismatch)

**How to fix (coefficients/β)**
1. **Use the same sample N as the paper** (this is the biggest driver of coefficient differences).
2. Ensure β is computed the same way:
   - Standardized coefficient should come from either:
     - fitting on z-scored variables (y and x) **with an intercept**, or
     - converting b to β via:  \(\beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{sd(x_j)}{sd(y)}\) using the **estimation sample**.
   - If you compute β using SDs from a different sample than the regression sample (e.g., before listwise deletion), β will be wrong even if b is right.
3. Verify the **dependent variable construction**: “Number of music genres disliked” must match the paper’s index exactly (which genres included, how “dislike” defined, how DK/NA handled). Any deviation changes y’s SD and thus all β’s.

### 3) Standard errors and p-values are reported/generated when the “true results” don’t include them

- **Mismatch:** Generated tables include **p-values, SE-based significance**, and star assignments derived from those p-values.
- **True Table 1:** explicitly says **SE are not reported**; stars reflect the paper’s own significance testing.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to “match Table 1,” do **not** present SE/p from your re-analysis as though they are the table’s numbers.
- Instead:
  - output only β (and constant), plus stars exactly as in the paper **if you are reproducing the printed table**, or
  - clearly label your p-values as “replication p-values (not in paper)” and expect star differences unless you replicate the exact weighting/design/df assumptions.

### 4) Variable-name / variable-definition problems (cause of missingness + coefficient sign errors)

#### Hispanic being dropped in Model 3
- **Mismatch:** Generated Model 3 shows `Hispanic = NaN` and “dropped hispanic”.
- **True:** Hispanic is included with **β = 0.031**.

**Likely causes**
- Perfect collinearity due to how race/ethnicity dummies were constructed (e.g., creating overlapping indicators: `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` without a consistent reference category, or coding Hispanic as part of race instead of ethnicity).
- Or `hispanic` becomes all-missing in the final complete-case sample because of merge/recoding errors.

**Fix**
- Rebuild race/ethnicity coding to match the paper’s scheme. Commonly:
  - Race dummies with White as reference: `black`, `otherrace`
  - Ethnicity dummy: `hispanic` (can overlap race in some datasets; you must follow the paper’s exact rule—often Hispanic is treated as mutually exclusive category, or Hispanic overrides race).
- Then check model matrix rank before fitting; ensure no redundant columns.

#### “Other race” sign flips in Model 2
- **Mismatch:** Generated Model 2 “Other race” β = **-0.027**, True = **0.005**.
- **Fix:** This is usually coding/reference-category mismatch. Confirm:
  - whether “Other race” includes Hispanics in the paper or excludes them,
  - whether White is the omitted category,
  - whether you accidentally coded `otherrace = 1` for White and 0 otherwise (inversion bugs happen).

#### Income per capita in Model 3 wildly off
- **Mismatch:** Generated β = **-0.050** vs True **-0.009**.
- **Fix:** This typically indicates either:
  - income variable is not the same (e.g., raw household income vs per-capita vs logged),
  - scaling differs (e.g., dividing by household size incorrectly, handling top-codes differently),
  - β computed with wrong SDs (see §2).

### 5) Interpretation mismatch (stars and narrative implied by them)

- **Model 3 Political intolerance**
  - Generated: **0.183** with ** (p=.0039)
  - True: **0.164*** (stronger significance category)
- **Age and Southern**
  - Generated: Age not significant in M3; Southern not significant in M2/M3
  - True: Age significant in M2 (***), M3 (*); Southern significant in M2 (**), M3 (**)

**How to fix**
- Replicate the paper’s:
  - sample,
  - variable construction,
  - and any weighting/design corrections (if they used GSS weights or design-based SEs).
- Also don’t infer “match” based on p-values unless you know the paper’s exact inferential method.

## Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 1

1. **Recreate the dependent variable** exactly (which genres, coding of dislike, treatment of DK/NA).
2. **Recreate each predictor** exactly (education, income per capita, prestige, political intolerance scale, religion categories, region/South, race/ethnicity).
3. **Align race/ethnicity dummies** so Hispanic is not collinear and matches the paper’s definition.
4. **Match the estimation samples** to reach N = **787 / 756 / 503** (your current N’s are far too small).
5. **Compute standardized coefficients β using the regression sample SDs** (or fit on standardized variables).
6. **For a “Table 1 replication,” suppress SE/p output** (since the true table doesn’t report them) and compare only β, constants, R², adj. R², N, and stars.

If you share the code (or at least the exact variable recodes), I can pinpoint which recode is causing the N collapse (especially `pol_intol` and `hispanic`) and the sign flip on “Other race.”
