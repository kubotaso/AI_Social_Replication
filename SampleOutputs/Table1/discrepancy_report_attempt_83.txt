### 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches

**DV label**
- **Generated:** “DV: Number of music genres disliked” (OK)
- **True:** same (OK)
- **Fix:** none.

**Predictor naming (table display vs. underlying terms)**
- **Generated uses:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `political_intolerance`
- **True Table 1 names:** Education; Household income per capita; Occupational prestige; Female; Age; Black; Hispanic; Other race; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern; Political intolerance
- **Mismatch:** purely presentation (abbreviations vs printed names).
- **Fix:** relabel coefficients in the output table to match Table 1 exactly. E.g., map `prestg80 → Occupational prestige`, `income_pc → Household income per capita`, etc.

### 3) Standard errors: all are incompatible with the “true” table

- **Generated table prints a second line under each coefficient that appears to be a standard error** (e.g., educ in Model 1 has “-0.310***” then “0.038”).
- **True results explicitly state:** Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only and does not print standard errors**.

**Mismatch:** Generated output invents/introduces SEs that cannot be validated against Table 1 and therefore cannot “match”.

**Fix options (choose one):**
1. **Remove SEs entirely** from the generated Table 1 output (best match to the PDF Table 1).
2. If you must show uncertainty, compute SEs from the microdata and clearly label the table as “replication using GSS microdata; SEs computed” — but then it will no longer be a match to the PDF’s printed Table 1.

---

### 4) Fit statistics and sample size mismatches (major)

**N**
- Generated: **748 / 738 / 417**
- True: **787 / 756 / 503**
- **Mismatch:** estimation samples are different.

**R² / Adjusted R²**
- Generated: R² **0.097 / 0.127 / 0.133**, Adj R² **0.094 / 0.113 / 0.107**
- True: R² **0.107 / 0.151 / 0.169**, Adj R² **0.104 / 0.139 / 0.148**
- **Mismatch:** all fit stats differ, consistent with using a different sample and/or different variable construction/standardization.

**Constants**
- Generated: **10.848 / 8.692 / 7.095**
- True: **10.920 / 8.507 / 6.516**
- **Mismatch:** all constants differ.

**Fix:**
- You must replicate **the same analytic sample restrictions and variable coding** used in the original PDF. Right now, your “listwise complete” counts (748/738/417) show you are dropping more cases than the published analysis (and for Model 3, dramatically more).
- Concretely, check and align:
  - **Year filter** (you show `N_year_1993=1606` but the published table N’s suggest a different path from 1606 → final N than yours).
  - **Construction of DV** (“music_18 complete” is 893 in your diagnostics; how does the original get 787/756/503 from the starting pool? Your missingness and listwise deletion path doesn’t match.)
  - **Whether weights were used** (GSS analyses sometimes apply weights; using weights changes coefficients and fit).
  - **Treatment of “don’t know/refused/not applicable”** codes. If you recoded them to NA differently than the authors, N and coefficients will shift a lot—especially for political intolerance (you drop 402 due to missing intolerance, leaving 491 nonmissing but only 417 listwise complete; the published Model 3 has 503, so you are likely coding additional items as missing or constructing the scale differently).

---

### 5) Significance-star mismatches

Even where coefficients are close, the **star levels** often don’t match the printed ones, notably:
- Model 2 **Age:** Generated ** (p=.002) vs True ***.
- Model 2 **Southern:** Generated ns vs True **.
- Model 3 **Education:** Generated * vs True **.
- Model 3 **Age:** Generated ns vs True *.

**Fix:**
- Once the **sample, coding, and weighting** match, recompute p-values. Star mismatches are usually downstream of (a) different N, (b) different model specification/coding, (c) different SE estimator (robust vs classical), or (d) weights/cluster design.
- Also ensure you’re using the **same two-tailed thresholds** as the paper (*, **, *** as stated). Your code appears to use that, but the underlying p-values are not matching because the model being estimated is not the same.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatches implied by the generated output

Your generated output (coefficients_long) implies interpretations that would differ from the published table because:
- Several variables **change sign** relative to the true table (e.g., Model 2 prestige; Model 2 Hispanic; Model 3 Black).
- Several effects are **overstated/understated** (e.g., political intolerance 0.181 vs 0.164; southern 0.067 vs 0.121).

**Fix:** do not interpret substantively until you have:
1) matched the analytic sample (N’s),  
2) matched variable construction (especially intolerance scale and DV), and  
3) matched estimation choices (weights/SE type).

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches Table 1

1. **Output only standardized coefficients (no SE lines)** in Table 1, because the true Table 1 does not report SEs.
2. **Match the published N’s** (787, 756, 503). This requires aligning:
   - year/subsample filters,
   - missing-value recodes,
   - scale construction for political intolerance,
   - and any weighting/design choices.
3. **Verify standardized-coefficient method**:
   - Standardize variables exactly as the authors did (typically z-scoring on the estimation sample). Differences in standardization (using full sample vs model-wise sample) can shift betas.
4. **Use the same model specification and reference categories** for dummies:
   - Your dummy set seems plausible, but sign flips (e.g., Hispanic) often indicate a coding/referent mismatch.
5. **Recompute and then hard-check each coefficient** against the target printed values; only after N’s and coding match should the coefficient differences shrink to rounding.

If you share the code that constructs (a) `num_genres_disliked` and (b) `political_intolerance` (and any year/weight filters), I can pinpoint exactly which recode or filter is causing the N gaps and the sign reversals.
