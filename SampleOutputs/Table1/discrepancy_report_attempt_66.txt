============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / labeling mismatches

**A. Education**
- **Generated term:** `educ`
- **True table label:** *Education*
- **Fix:** Purely cosmetic unless your pipeline maps labels. Ensure the table prints “Education” (or rename in the output stage).

**B. Household income per capita**
- **Generated term:** `income_pc`
- **True table label:** *Household income per capita*
- **Fix:** Cosmetic unless you computed income_pc differently than the article. Verify the construction (household income divided by household size, same year dollars, same trimming). Then label to match.

**C. Occupational prestige**
- **Generated term:** `prestg80`
- **True table label:** *Occupational prestige*
- **Fix:** Cosmetic, but also verify you used the same prestige scale and coding as the source (e.g., 1980 prestige score). Label to match.

**D. Race / religion dummies**
- **Generated terms:** `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`
- **True labels:** *Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern*
- **Fix:** Mostly labeling. The bigger risk is **different reference categories** (see Interpretation section).

**E. Political intolerance**
- **Generated term:** `political_intolerance`
- **True label:** *Political intolerance*
- **Fix:** Labeling + ensure the scale direction matches the article (higher = more intolerance vs more tolerance).

No obvious *missing variables* relative to the “Variables included” lists—the generated models include the same covariate sets.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Table 1 in the PDF reports **standardized coefficients (betas)**. Your `coefficients_long.beta_std` should match those. It does not.

Below are **every beta mismatch** (Generated vs True). I’m using the standardized coefficients shown in your `coefficients_long` / table.

#### Model 1 (SES): true N=787, generated N=758 (this alone can move betas)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332 | -0.322 | too negative by 0.010 |
| HH income pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | slightly less negative (0.003) |
| Occ prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | too positive by 0.013 |

#### Model 2 (Demographic): true N=756, generated N=523 (major discrepancy)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.302 | -0.246 | far too negative (0.056) |
| HH income pc | -0.057 | -0.054 | close (0.003) |
| Occ prestige | -0.007 | -0.006 | close (0.001) |
| Female | -0.078 | -0.083 | close (0.005) but **stars differ** (see below) |
| Age | 0.109 | 0.140 | too small by 0.031 |
| Black | 0.053 | 0.029 | too large by 0.024 |
| Hispanic | -0.017 | -0.029 | too small magnitude by 0.012 |
| Other race | -0.016 | 0.005 | wrong sign |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.040 | 0.059 | too small by 0.019 |
| No religion | -0.016 | -0.012 | close (0.004) |
| Southern | 0.079 | 0.097 | too small by 0.018 |

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance): true N=503, generated N=293 (major discrepancy)
| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.157 | -0.151 | close (0.006) but **stars differ** |
| HH income pc | -0.067 | -0.009 | much too negative (0.058) |
| Occ prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | too small magnitude by 0.014 |
| Female | -0.118 | -0.095 | too negative by 0.023 |
| Age | 0.092 | 0.110 | too small by 0.018 |
| Black | 0.004 | 0.049 | too small by 0.045 |
| Hispanic | 0.091 | 0.031 | too large by 0.060 |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| Cons. Protestant | -0.011 | 0.066 | wrong sign |
| No religion | 0.018 | 0.024 | close (0.006) |
| Southern | 0.073 | 0.121 | too small by 0.048 |
| Political intolerance | 0.196 | 0.164 | too large by 0.032 |

**Bottom line:** the betas are not reproducing the printed table, especially Models 2–3. The single biggest red flag is the **estimation sample sizes** (N).

### 3) Standard errors: generated vs “true”

- **Generated output includes SEs** (the second line under each coefficient in `table1_style` appears to be standard errors).
- **True Table 1 explicitly does not print SEs.** Therefore you cannot “match” SEs to Table 1 because there are none to match.

**Fix options:**
1. **To match the PDF table:** remove SEs from the printed table entirely and report only standardized betas + stars.
2. **If you need SEs:** you must obtain them from the original model output (not from Table 1) or re-estimate the models exactly as in the article; but they still won’t be verifiable against Table 1.

---

### 4) Fit-statistics mismatches (R², Adj. R², constants, N)

These are large and systematic.

#### N (cases)
- **True:** M1=787, M2=756, M3=503  
- **Generated:** M1=758, M2=523, M3=293

**Fix:** Your estimation samples are much smaller, especially Models 2–3. This is almost certainly due to **listwise deletion caused by how you coded missing values** (notably `hispanic` and `political_intolerance`).

Evidence in your own diagnostics:
- `hispanic` missing = 281 (huge)
- `political_intolerance` missing = 402 (huge)

Those missingness patterns are likely *not* what the original authors had (or they handled missing differently—e.g., used different source variables, different year filters, different “don’t know/refused” recodes, or used imputation/indicator methods).

Concrete fixes:
- Recreate the author’s sample restrictions first (year=1993 seems right per your diagnostics, but confirm **all** restrictions).
- Audit missing-value coding:
  - In GSS-like data, categories such as *DK/NA/Refused* are often numeric codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) that must be recoded to NA **before** creating dummies/scales.
  - Your `hispanic` variable may be derived from a question asked of only a subsample or coded such that many people are “missing” rather than “0”. If Table 1 uses a **race/ethnicity** scheme where Hispanic is derived from *ethnicity + race*, you must replicate that logic.
- For political intolerance: verify it’s constructed as in the paper (often an index across multiple items). If you used a single item or required complete responses to all items, you’ll drop many more cases than the authors.

#### Constants
- **True constants:** 10.920, 8.507, 6.516
- **Generated constants:** 11.086, 10.089, 7.583

These won’t match unless:
- you use the **same sample** (biggest driver),
- you use the **same DV scaling** (e.g., count 0–18 must be identical),
- and you estimate the same model (OLS with same handling of missing, same weights if used).

#### R² / Adj R²
- **True R²:** 0.107, 0.151, 0.169
- **Generated R²:** 0.1088, 0.1572, 0.1515

Model 3 is notably off (true higher than generated). Again, sample + variable construction differences.

**Fix:** once sample + variable construction match, R² should fall in line. If not, check:
- weighting (authors may have used weights; your diagnostics say `weights_used=False`)
- robust vs conventional variance does **not** affect R², but weighting can.
- any nonlinear treatment (e.g., age squared) — not indicated in your “true results,” so less likely.

### 5) Significance-star / interpretation mismatches

Because your p-values come from your (different) estimation sample, your stars don’t match the PDF.

Specific star mismatches:

#### Model 2
- **Female**
  - True: -0.083*
  - Generated: p=0.061 → **no star**
  - **Fix:** match sample/weights; female should become significant at p<.05 if you reproduce the paper.
- **Age**
  - True: 0.140***
  - Generated: p=0.0117 → only *
  - **Fix:** again, sample/weights/construction. With correct model, age should be much more precisely estimated (and/or larger beta).

#### Model 3
- **Education**
  - True: -0.151**
  - Generated: p=0.024 → *
- **Political intolerance**
  - True: 0.164***
  - Generated: p=0.00163 → ** (not ***)
  - **Fix:** with N=503 and correct construction, p likely becomes <.001 as printed.

Also, note a likely **interpretation risk**:
- The DV is “number of genres disliked.” Negative coefficients mean *fewer* genres disliked (greater tolerance/openness in music tastes), positive means *more* disliked.
- Ensure your narrative aligns with that direction. (Your prompt asks for interpretation mismatches; the provided generated text doesn’t include narrative, but this is where errors often happen.)

### 6) The main causes and how to fix so the generated analysis matches

#### Cause 1: Wrong estimation Ns due to missingness handling
- Your Models 2 and 3 collapse to 523 and 293 cases, while true results retain 756 and 503.
- **Fix checklist**
  1. Identify the exact source variables used for `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` in the paper.
  2. Recode all special missing codes to NA *before* construction.
  3. Construct `hispanic` so that non-Hispanics are coded 0 rather than missing.
  4. Reconstruct the political intolerance index exactly (items included, reverse coding, scaling, and the rule for partial completion—authors often allow some missing items rather than requiring complete data).
  5. Re-run models with the same listwise rules as the article (or replicate their imputation/“missing indicator” approach if they used one).

#### Cause 2: Weights mismatch (likely)
- Your diagnostics explicitly say `weights_used=False`.
- Many GSS-based analyses apply `WTSSALL` (or a year-appropriate weight). Your own note mentions “WTSSALL if available,” but it also says weights weren’t used.
- **Fix:** confirm from the paper whether weights were used. If yes, estimate weighted OLS with the same weight variable and compute standardized betas using the weighted SDs on the weighted estimation sample.

#### Cause 3: Standardization method mismatch
Even with identical raw coefficients, standardized betas can differ if:
- you standardized on a different sample (you did),
- you used weighted vs unweighted SDs,
- you standardized using sample SD (n−1) vs population SD (n).
Your note says “weighted (pop) SDs,” which may not match the author’s approach.

**Fix:** After you match the sample and weighting, standardize exactly as the authors did. If unknown, the safest replication for a printed standardized beta table is:
- compute betas from a regression on z-scored variables (using the same sample; usually unweighted unless stated), or
- use the common beta formula with **sample SDs** (n−1). Many software packages default to sample SD.

#### Cause 4: Reference categories for dummies may differ
Signs that may indicate coding/reference mismatch:
- Model 2 “Other race” is negative in generated (-0.016) but positive in true (0.005).
- Model 3 “Conservative Protestant” is negative in generated (-0.011) but positive in true (0.066).

These can happen with sampling noise, but given the giant N drop, they’re more likely sample-driven; still, verify:
- whether “Conservative Protestant” is defined identically (specific denominations? born-again variable?),
- whether “No religion” excludes “other religion,”
- and what the baseline category is (typically White, non-Hispanic, non-South, non-CP, religious-but-not-CP, male).

**Fix:** replicate dummy construction and baseline exactly; ensure mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories if that’s what Table 1 uses.

### 7) What to change in the generated output so it *looks like* the true table

If your goal is to match the PDF presentation:

1. **Print only standardized coefficients** (no SE rows).
2. Use the **Table 1 variable names** exactly (Education, Household income per capita, etc.).
3. Show **N, R², Adj R², Constant** matching the re-estimated models.
4. Use the same star cutoffs (you already do), but stars will only match once the model and sample match.

If you share the code used to construct `hispanic` and `political_intolerance` (or a codebook excerpt), I can pinpoint exactly why you’re losing ~233 cases in Model 2 and ~210 more in Model 3 and give precise recodes to recover the true Ns.
