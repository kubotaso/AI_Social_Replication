Score: 32/100
============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** fail to match the **True Results** (Table 1 from the paper), plus what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the table.

---

## 1) Fit statistics: **R², adjusted R², and N all mismatch**

### Model 1 (SES)
- **N**
  - Generated: **747**
  - True: **787**
  - **Fix:** Your estimation sample is smaller than the paper’s. This usually comes from (a) listwise deletion on variables the paper didn’t delete on, (b) different recodes, or (c) accidentally filtering years/cases.
- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.088 / 0.085**
  - True: **0.107 / 0.104**
  - **Fix:** Once you match the sample and the exact variable construction, R² should move toward the paper’s.

### Model 2 (Demographic)
- **N**
  - Generated: **507**
  - True: **756**
- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.139 / 0.120**
  - True: **0.151 / 0.139**
- **Fix:** Massive N-loss indicates you’re dropping many cases—most likely because at least one covariate is coded missing differently than in the paper (common culprits: income, prestige, or religion variables), or you are requiring non-missing on the Model 3 variable (political intolerance) already in Model 2.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
- **N**
  - Generated: **286**
  - True: **503**
- **R² / adj. R²**
  - Generated: **0.149 / 0.111**
  - True: **0.169 / 0.148**
- **Fix:** You are losing **too many** cases when adding political intolerance. Your own missingness table shows `pol_intol` is missing **47%**; the paper’s model evidently has much better retention. That implies **your `pol_intol` construction is not the same** as the paper’s (wrong source variable, wrong year, wrong skip pattern handling, or treating “don’t know / not asked” as missing when the paper recoded/handled differently).

---

## 2) The “table” coefficients (β) don’t match the paper’s β

The paper’s Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients (β)** for predictors and **unstandardized constants**. Your `model*_table1style` appears to report standardized betas for predictors, but many values differ.

### Model 1 β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | **-0.292*** | **-0.322*** | too small in magnitude |
| Income pc | **-0.039** | **-0.037** | close (minor mismatch) |
| Prestige | **0.020** | **0.016** | small mismatch |
| Constant | **10.638** | **10.920** | constant differs materially |

**Fix:** Match (1) sample, (2) exact coding of DV and predictors, and (3) standardization method. Differences this large in education/constant are rarely rounding—they reflect different data or operationalization.

### Model 2 β mismatches (many)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Direction/size issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | mismatch |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | mismatch |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | close |
| **Age** | **0.103*** (actually only `*` in your table) | **0.140*** | **too small** and stars wrong |
| **Black** | **0.100** | **0.029** | far too large |
| **Hispanic** | **0.074** | **-0.029** | **sign flips** |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **0.005** | sign mismatch |
| Cons Prot | 0.087 | 0.059 | mismatch |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | close |
| **Southern** | **0.061** | **0.097** | too small; stars missing (paper has **)** |
| Constant | 8.675 | 8.507 | mismatch |

**Fixes (most important):**
1. **Race/ethnicity variable construction is wrong.** The sign flip for Hispanic and “Other race” strongly suggests different reference categories or different dummy definitions.
   - Ensure **one** omitted category (typically White non-Hispanic) and the dummies are mutually exclusive:
     - `black=1 if Black, 0 otherwise`
     - `hispanic=1 if Hispanic, 0 otherwise`
     - `otherrace=1 if neither White nor Black nor Hispanic, 0 otherwise`
   - Verify the paper’s coding: some GSS race/ethnicity constructions treat Hispanic as ethnicity overriding race; others don’t. Your coding likely doesn’t match the paper’s rule.
2. **Age effect too small + wrong stars** suggests either:
   - age is scaled differently (e.g., decades vs years), or
   - you’re using a restricted sample with different age distribution, or
   - you standardized differently (see §4).
3. **Southern** being smaller and losing significance also points to sample/coding mismatch (or region definition mismatch).

### Model 3 β mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | close magnitude; **stars differ** |
| **Income pc** | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | huge mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | mismatch |
| Female | -0.127* | -0.095* | mismatch |
| **Age** | **0.091 (ns)** | **0.110*** | stars differ |
| Black | 0.060 | 0.049 | close |
| **Hispanic** | **-0.030** | **0.031** | **sign flip** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | matches |
| Cons Prot | 0.036 | 0.066 | mismatch |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | matches |
| **Southern** | **0.068 (ns)** | **0.121** ** | too small and stars differ |
| **Political intolerance** | **0.184** ** | **0.164*** | magnitude/stars differ |
| **Constant** | **7.999** | **6.516** | large mismatch |

**Fixes (most important):**
- Again, **race/ethnicity coding mismatch** (Hispanic sign flip).
- **Income per capita** in Model 3 is wildly off (β -0.052 vs -0.009). That usually means you are using a *different income variable* (or different per-capita transformation) than the paper.
- Political intolerance β/stars differ and your N is far too small → your **pol_intol** variable is not the same as the paper’s.

---

## 3) You are reporting SE/p-values, but the “True Results” table does not include SE

This isn’t a “mismatch” per se, but it creates interpretive inconsistencies:

- The paper’s Table 1 provides **β and significance stars only** (no SE shown).
- Your generated output shows **unstandardized b, standardized beta, p-values**, and stars derived from your p-values.

**Fix:** If your goal is to match Table 1 exactly:
- suppress SE/p reporting in the final table, and
- compute stars using the same two-tailed thresholds (you already list them) **but only after matching the sample and coding**, otherwise stars won’t match.

---

## 4) Standardization method likely differs from the paper

The true table uses standardized coefficients (β). Your βs may be computed differently because of:
- standardizing using the **analysis sample** vs full sample,
- standardizing before vs after listwise deletion,
- using **weighted** vs unweighted SDs (if the paper applied GSS weights),
- or mixing standardized/unstandardized inadvertently.

**Fix:**
- Confirm whether the paper uses **weights** (common in GSS analyses). If yes, reproduce with the same weight variable and weighted standardization.
- Compute β in the standard way:  
  \[
  \beta_j = b_j \times \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
  \]
  using the **same estimation sample** as the model.

---

## 5) Variable name/content mismatches that are strongly indicated

### Dependent variable
- True DV: **Number of Music Genres Disliked**.
- Your missingness table calls it `num_genres_disliked` (fine), but your N collapses across models far more than expected.
- **Fix:** Verify DV construction matches the paper (same set of genres, same coding of “dislike,” same handling of “don’t know / not asked”).

### Political intolerance
- Your `pol_intol` is missing **47%**, producing **N=286**, but the paper has **N=503** in Model 3.
- **Fix:** Identify the exact GSS items/year used for the intolerance scale (0–15) and replicate:
  - same items,
  - same scoring,
  - same rule for partial nonresponse (e.g., allow some missing items and prorate vs require all items).

### Income per capita
- You use `inc_pc`. Paper’s “household income per capita” is often constructed as household income divided by household size (sometimes capped/logged or midpoints used).
- The **Model 3 β** mismatch suggests your `inc_pc` is **not** what the paper used.
- **Fix:** Recreate income-per-capita exactly: confirm income source variable (categorical vs continuous), midpoint conversion, inflation adjustment (if any), household size definition, and handling of top-codes.

### Race/ethnicity
- Hispanic sign flips in Models 2 and 3 are the biggest red flag.
- **Fix:** Match the paper’s mutually exclusive categories and reference group. Ensure “Hispanic” is not double-counted with Black/Other, and ensure the omitted group is the same as the paper’s.

---

## 6) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars) in your “Table1-style” output

Examples:
- **Model 2 Age:** Generated `0.103*` but True `0.140***`
- **Model 2 Southern:** Generated `0.061` (no stars) but True `0.097**`
- **Model 3 Education:** Generated `-0.155*` but True `-0.151**`
- **Model 3 Political intolerance:** Generated `0.184**` but True `0.164***`

**Fix:** Stars will not align until:
1) N matches, 2) coefficients match, 3) the same weighting and standardization are used, and 4) the same two-tailed tests are applied.

---

## 7) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Lock the dataset to “GSS 1993”** exactly as the paper does (no pooled years; no accidental inclusion/exclusion).
2. **Rebuild variables from the codebook/paper definitions:**
   - DV (genres disliked)
   - education (years)
   - occupational prestige (exact prestige scale used)
   - income per capita (exact transformation)
   - race/ethnicity dummies (mutually exclusive; correct reference)
   - religion indicators (especially “Conservative Protestant” definition)
   - South (region definition)
   - political intolerance scale (items + scoring + missing-data rule)
3. **Replicate the paper’s missing-data handling.**
   - Your Model 2 and 3 N are far too small; this is the primary cause of downstream coefficient/star differences.
4. **Apply the same weights (if any) and compute β consistently** on the estimation sample.
5. **Produce the final table using standardized β only (and unstandardized constant)** to match the paper’s presentation.

If you paste your variable construction code (especially for `pol_intol`, `inc_pc`, and the race/ethnicity dummies) and whether you used weights, I can pinpoint the *exact* coding choices causing the sign flips and the N collapse.
