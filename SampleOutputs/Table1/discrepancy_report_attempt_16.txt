============================================================

### 1) Fit statistics: **all mismatched / missing in the generated output**
**Generated:** `n = 0`, `r2 = NaN`, `adj_r2 = NaN` for all three models.  
**True:** Model 1 `n=787, R²=.107, adj R²=.104`; Model 2 `n=756, R²=.151, adj R²=.139`; Model 3 `n=503, R²=.169, adj R²=.148`.

**What went wrong (diagnosis):**
- Your model frames are **empty** (`Empty DataFrame ... Index: []`). That forces `n=0` and makes all estimates `NaN`.
- The missingness audit shows why frames became empty: at least one required predictor is missing for (almost) everyone in the constructed dataset—especially `inc_pc` (100% missing) and race dummies (`hispanic`, `otherrace` ~93% missing). With listwise deletion, that can drop the sample to zero.

**How to fix:**
- **Fix the variable construction/merges** so key predictors are populated (see Sections 3–4 below).
- Recreate each model’s analysis dataset using **rowwise complete cases only on variables in that model**, after fixing variable coding:
  - Model 1 complete cases on `num_genres_disliked, educ_yrs, inc_pc, prestg80` should yield `n≈787`.
  - Model 2 adds demographic dummies, should yield `n≈756`.
  - Model 3 adds `pol_intol`, should yield `n≈503`.
- Confirm the sample sizes by printing `df_model.shape[0]` before fitting.

### 2) Coefficients / SE / p-values: **generated output is entirely NaN and structurally inconsistent with the true table**
**Generated:** columns `b`, `beta`, `p`, but every value is `NaN`.  
**True:** Table reports **standardized coefficients (β)** with significance stars; **standard errors are not reported**; constants are **unstandardized**.

**Mismatches:**
1. **No coefficient values at all** (NaNs) vs. the nonzero βs and constants in the true table.
2. **Standard errors**: generated output implies they were computed (you have `p` values), but the “true results” table explicitly says **SEs are not reported**. So even if your regression ran, your output format does not match what the paper/table provides.
3. **Interpretation level**: the true table’s main reported coefficients are **standardized β**, but your table includes both `b` and `beta` without clarifying which should be compared. The comparison must be: **your `beta` ↔ true β**, and **your constant `b` ↔ true constant** (because constants aren’t standardized).

**How to fix:**
- Decide what you are trying to “match”:
  - If matching the paper: **report standardized coefficients only (β)**, plus the **unstandardized constant**, plus R²/adj R²/n, and add significance stars from p-values.
  - Do **not** present SEs if the “true” benchmark doesn’t include them (or label them as “not reported” and don’t compare).
- Compute standardized coefficients correctly (see Section 5).

### 3) Variable name mismatches: **internal names vs. displayed labels are inconsistent, and some appear incorrectly created**
There are two layers: (a) internal variable names in `model_frames`, and (b) printed labels in the regression tables.

**Observed:**
- Internal vars: `educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80`, `pol_intol`, `num_genres_disliked`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`, `cons_prot`, `norelig`, `south`.
- Printed terms: “Education (years)”, “Household income per capita”, “Occupational prestige”, etc.

**Mismatches / likely issues:**
- The *names* themselves aren’t the problem; the **coding is** (see missingness below). But you should ensure consistent mapping so you don’t accidentally compare the wrong variable.
- Race variables: the benchmark table has **Black, Hispanic, Other race** (implying White is the reference). Your internal names match (`black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace`), but their missingness suggests they were not properly generated as 0/1 dummies.

**How to fix:**
- Create an explicit **name map** between internal vars and table labels, and validate that each exists and has plausible distributions:
  - e.g., `df['hispanic'].value_counts(dropna=False)` should show mostly 0/1, not mostly missing.
- Ensure reference categories match the paper (typically White, Male, non-Southern, etc.). If you used different reference categories, coefficients won’t match even if the model runs.

### 4) Missingness discrepancies: **your constructed variables are missing for most/all cases**
Key mismatches relative to the true models (which clearly had hundreds of usable cases):

- `inc_pc`: **100% missing** (0 nonmissing out of 1606)  
  → This alone guarantees Model 1/2/3 frames collapse to 0 under complete-case selection.
- `hispanic` and `otherrace`: **93.3% missing**  
  → Even if `inc_pc` were fixed, these would destroy Models 2–3.
- `pol_intol`: 47% missing; outcome: 44% missing  
  → Some missing is expected, but your final n should still be nonzero and should roughly align with 787/756/503 if coded as in the source.

**How to fix (most likely causes and repairs):**
1. **Income per capita (`inc_pc`) construction error**
   - Common failure modes:
     - Dividing by household size when household size is missing/zero for all.
     - Merging income with household size using mismatched IDs/years.
     - Income variable is present but coded with special missing values (e.g., 0, 98, 99, 999, “DK/NA”) not converted to NA correctly or converted *everything* to NA.
   - Fix:
     - Verify source variables exist and have nonmissing values before transformation.
     - Recode GSS-style missing codes to NA **correctly** (only the specific codes, not all values).
     - If “per capita” requires household size, ensure household size is valid and nonzero; otherwise compute income category midpoint and divide only where hhsize is valid.

2. **Race dummy creation error**
   - 93% missing usually indicates you created dummies from a variable that is itself mostly missing due to recoding.
   - Fix:
     - Start from the raw race/ethnicity variables used by the paper (GSS often has `race` and a separate `hispanic` indicator; coding differs by year).
     - Create:
       - `black = 1(race==Black)`
       - `hispanic = 1(hispanic_origin==Yes)` (or whatever the year uses)
       - `otherrace = 1(race==Other)` **excluding** those counted as Hispanic if the paper treats Hispanic separately (important for comparability).
     - Set all non-target groups explicitly to 0, not NA.

3. **Listwise deletion applied too early or too broadly**
   - If you drop missing cases on the full set of variables for Model 3 before building Model 1, you can inadvertently force Model 1’s n to match Model 3 (or to 0).
   - Fix:
     - Build separate `df_m1`, `df_m2`, `df_m3` using complete cases **only for the variables in that model**.

### 5) Coefficient-type mismatch: **you must compare standardized β, not raw b**
The true table reports **standardized OLS coefficients (β)** for predictors.

**Generated output includes both `b` and `beta`, but:**
- If `beta` wasn’t computed (or was computed on an empty frame), you can’t compare.
- If you compute β incorrectly (e.g., standardizing including 0/1 dummies differently than the paper did), you’ll diverge.

**How to fix:**
- Fit the OLS on unstandardized variables (for correct constant), then compute standardized betas as:
  - For each predictor \(x_j\):  \(\beta_j = b_j \times \frac{\text{SD}(x_j)}{\text{SD}(y)}\)
  - Do **not** standardize the intercept; keep it as unstandardized constant (like the table).
- Ensure SDs are computed on the **analysis sample for that model** (after listwise deletion), because SDs change with the sample and affect β.

---

### 6) Interpretation / reporting mismatches
**Generated:** reports p-values but no stars; implies SEs exist; provides both `b` and `beta`.  
**True:** provides β and significance stars; explicitly no SEs in the table; constants shown; R²/adj R²/n shown.

**How to fix the reporting to match the “true results”:**
- Output table columns: `Variable`, `β`, (optional) `sig` stars; plus Constant as `b` not β; plus fit stats.
- Derive stars from p-values using the same thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001).
- Do not claim SEs are “true” if your benchmark doesn’t provide them; mark as “not reported” or omit.

---

### 7) What you should see after fixes (targets to validate)
Once the data issues are fixed and β computed properly, your output should reproduce these benchmarks:

- **Model 1:** Education β ≈ -0.322***; income β ≈ -0.037 (ns); prestige β ≈ 0.016 (ns); Constant ≈ 10.920; R²≈.107; n≈787.
- **Model 2:** Education β ≈ -0.246***; Female β ≈ -0.083*; Age β ≈ 0.140***; Southern β ≈ 0.097**; Constant ≈ 8.507; R²≈.151; n≈756.
- **Model 3:** Political intolerance β ≈ 0.164***; Education attenuates to β ≈ -0.151**; Constant ≈ 6.516; R²≈.169; n≈503.

If your coefficients still differ materially after fixing missingness and standardization, the remaining culprits are usually: different coding of the dependent variable, different construction of income per capita, different reference categories for dummies, or using weights (the paper may or may not).

If you share the code (or at least the raw variable names and your recode rules for income/race/political intolerance and the DV), I can pinpoint exactly why `inc_pc`, `hispanic`, and `otherrace` ended up missing and specify the precise recoding changes needed.
