============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True (Table 1) Results**, covering **variable names**, **coefficients (β)**, **constants**, **R²/Adj. R²**, **N**, and **interpretation/reporting**. I also specify exactly how to fix each problem so the generated output matches Table 1.

---

## 1) Core reporting mismatch: you mixed **unstandardized b** with **standardized β**
### What Table 1 (true) reports
- Table 1 reports **standardized OLS coefficients (β)** for predictors.
- The **constant** is **unstandardized**.
- **Standard errors are not reported** in Table 1 (only stars).

### What the generated output does
- Shows both `b` and `beta`, but the comparison table (`table1_panel`) reports **betas** while the “full” model tables mix in **b** and **p-values** derived from your own estimation.
- This creates conflicts because even small differences in sample and coding will change p-values and stars.

### Fix
To match Table 1:
1. **Only report β (standardized) for predictors**, and **unstandardized constant**.
2. **Do not report standard errors or p-values** (Table 1 doesn’t).
3. **Apply stars exactly as in the paper**, not based on your re-estimated p-values.

---

## 2) Sample size (N) mismatches — major and pervasive
These are not small differences; they change coefficients and fit stats.

### Model Ns
| Model | Generated N | True N | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Model 1 | 747 | 787 | -40 cases |
| Model 2 | 507 | 756 | -249 cases |
| Model 3 | 286 | 503 | -217 cases |

### Likely causes (based on your missingness table)
- You are doing **listwise deletion** on variables that have huge missingness:
  - `pol_intol` missing **47%**
  - the DV `num_genres_disliked` missing **44%**
- But the *true* Ns in the paper are much larger than your listwise-deletion frames—especially Model 2 and Model 3—suggesting at least one of these is true:
  1. You are using the **wrong dataset/year** or wrong merge (DV/pol_intol not aligned with 1993 subsample used in the paper).
  2. You are using a **different DV construction** than the paper (creating far more missingness).
  3. You are coding filters incorrectly (e.g., dropping cases beyond what the paper did).
  4. You accidentally require nonmissing `pol_intol` earlier than Model 3 (shrinking Model 2 too much).

### Fix
- Recreate the analytic sample **exactly as the paper**:
  - Use **GSS 1993** (and the same inclusion criteria).
  - Construct **Number of Music Genres Disliked** exactly as the paper (and confirm item nonresponse handling).
  - Ensure Model 2 does **not** require nonmissing `pol_intol`.
- Implement model-specific frames:
  - Model 1: drop only cases missing DV or SES vars.
  - Model 2: drop only cases missing DV, SES, and demographic vars.
  - Model 3: additionally drop only those missing political intolerance.
- Verify you reproduce the **true N = 787, 756, 503** before worrying about coefficients.

## 3) Fit statistics mismatches (R² and Adjusted R²)
| Model | Generated R² | True R² | Generated Adj R² | True Adj R² |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 0.088 | 0.107 | 0.0846 | 0.104 |
| 2 | 0.139 | 0.151 | 0.1196 | 0.139 |
| 3 | 0.149 | 0.169 | 0.1112 | 0.148 |

### Interpretation
- The pattern (generated R² lower, adj R² especially lower) is consistent with:
  - wrong sample (N too small),
  - different variable coding,
  - and/or accidentally including extra noise/measurement differences.

### Fix
Once the **sample and variables** match Table 1, your R² should move toward the true values. Do not “force” R²; fix upstream issues (sample, coding, standardization).

## 4) Coefficient (β) mismatches by model

### Model 1 (SES) — Table 1 vs generated betas
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.292*** | -0.322*** | **Mismatch** (too small in magnitude) |
| Income pc | -0.039 | -0.037 | Close (minor mismatch) |
| Prestige | 0.020 | 0.016 | Minor mismatch |
| Constant | 10.638 | 10.920 | **Mismatch** |
| N | 747 | 787 | **Mismatch** |
| R² | 0.088 | 0.107 | **Mismatch** |

**Fix:** primarily sample/coding; once N=787 and the same DV is used, education and constant should align more closely.

---

### Model 2 (Demographic) — biggest directional/sign mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.265*** | -0.246*** | Mismatch |
| Income pc | -0.051 | -0.054 | Minor mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.011 | -0.006 | Minor mismatch |
| Female | -0.085* | -0.083* | Close |
| **Age** | **0.103***? (generated shows 0.103* only) | **0.140*** | **Mismatch (size + stars)** |
| **Black** | **0.100** | **0.029** | **Mismatch (size)** |
| **Hispanic** | **0.074** | **-0.029** | **Mismatch (sign)** |
| **Other race** | **-0.027** | **0.005** | **Mismatch (sign)** |
| Cons Prot | 0.087 | 0.059 | Mismatch |
| No religion | -0.015 | -0.012 | Close |
| **Southern** | **0.061** | **0.097** | **Mismatch (size + stars)** |
| Constant | 8.675 | 8.507 | Mismatch |
| N | 507 | 756 | **Mismatch** |

**Fix (priority order):**
1. **Stop shrinking Model 2 to N=507.** Model 2 should be 756. This alone can flip race/ethnicity coefficients (and their signs).
2. Ensure race/ethnicity dummies match the paper’s coding:
   - “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race” likely relative to **White** omitted category.
   - Confirm “Hispanic” isn’t being treated as race vs ethnicity differently than the paper.
3. Ensure “Southern” is coded the same (region definition).
4. Apply the paper’s star thresholds to the *paper’s coefficients*, not your p-values.

### Model 3 (Political intolerance) — several sign/magnitude mismatches
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Education | -0.155* | -0.151** | Close magnitude, **stars mismatch** |
| **Income pc** | **-0.052** | **-0.009** | **Mismatch (large)** |
| Prestige | -0.015 | -0.022 | Mismatch |
| Female | -0.127* | -0.095* | Mismatch |
| **Age** | **0.091 (ns)** | **0.110*** | Mismatch (size + stars) |
| Black | 0.060 | 0.049 | Close |
| **Hispanic** | **-0.030** | **0.031** | **Mismatch (sign)** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.053 | Match |
| Cons Prot | 0.036 | 0.066 | Mismatch |
| No religion | 0.023 | 0.024 | Match (very close) |
| **Southern** | **0.068 (ns)** | **0.121** | Mismatch (size + stars) |
| Political intolerance | 0.184** | 0.164*** | Mismatch (size + stars) |
| **Constant** | **7.999** | **6.516** | **Mismatch** |
| N | 286 | 503 | **Mismatch** |

**Fix:**
1. Fix Model 3 sample first (N must be 503). Your `pol_intol` variable is causing huge attrition; likely it’s constructed incorrectly or drawn from the wrong wave/module.
2. Rebuild `inc_pc` exactly as the paper did. The true β for income in Model 3 is **-0.009**, but yours is **-0.052**—that’s not rounding error; it’s usually a **coding/scale problem** (e.g., income not per capita, not logged, wrong top-codes, different scaling before standardization).
3. Ensure political intolerance scale is **0–15** and constructed from the same items with same missing-data rules as the paper.

---

## 5) Variable naming and mapping issues
### Inconsistencies
- Generated tables label predictors in human-readable form (“Education (years)”), but missingness table uses raw names (`educ_yrs`, `inc_pc`, `prestg80_v`, etc.).
- Race labels differ: generated uses “Other race”, missingness uses `otherrace`; true table uses “Other race”.

This is mostly cosmetic, but it can hide real coding mistakes (especially for Hispanic).

### Fix
Create an explicit codebook/mapping and verify:
- `educ_yrs` → Education (years)
- `inc_pc` → Household income per capita (same definition as paper)
- `prestg80_v` → Occupational prestige (same scale)
- `black`, `hispanic`, `otherrace` dummies are mutually exclusive and match paper’s reference group
- `south` → Southern
- `cons_prot`, `norelig` match paper definitions

---

## 6) Significance stars and interpretation mismatches
Because Table 1 stars come from the paper’s tests, your stars should match **their** stars if you are “extracting” rather than “re-estimating.”

Examples:
- Model 2 **Age**: true is **0.140***, generated shows only `*` (and smaller β).
- Model 2 **Southern**: true **0.097** with `**`, generated β smaller and no stars.
- Model 3 **Political intolerance**: true **0.164***, generated `**`.

### Fix
Decide your goal:
- **If reproducing Table 1 exactly:** do not compute stars from your model; copy them from the paper once coefficients match.
- **If re-estimating from GSS microdata:** then don’t claim they are the “true extracted results”; report your computed SEs/p-values and accept differences—but then your output should not be presented as matching Table 1.

---

## 7) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 1
1. **Reconstruct the DV** (“Number of Music Genres Disliked”) exactly as the paper, and check missingness (it should not be ~44% unless the paper had that too).
2. **Use the correct year/subsample** (GSS 1993) and any filters the paper applied.
3. Build three separate model frames so Model 2 doesn’t inherit Model 3 missingness.
4. **Standardize predictors (and/or compute standardized coefficients)** the same way as the paper did:
   - Ideally: estimate OLS on unstandardized variables and compute β post hoc:  
     \[
     \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
     \]
     using the model’s estimation sample.
5. Report only:
   - β for predictors, constant unstandardized, R²/Adj R², N, and stars as in the paper.
   - Omit SEs if you are trying to match Table 1.

If you share the exact code used to (a) construct `num_genres_disliked` and `pol_intol`, and (b) define the model frames for Models 1–3, I can pinpoint which specific line(s) are causing the N collapse and the sign flips (especially Hispanic/Other race and income in Model 3).
