Score: 35/100
============================================================

### 1) Table formatting/metadata mismatches (what the table *claims* to show)

**Mismatch A — Standard errors are printed in the generated table (but shouldn’t be).**  
- **Generated:** `table1_style` shows a second numeric row under each coefficient (looks like SEs), and it also states “Table prints standardized betas only (no SE rows)”—which contradicts the displayed table.
- **True:** Table 1 reports **standardized coefficients only** and **does not print SEs**.

**Fix:**  
- Remove all SE-like rows from the printed table (or clearly label them as something else if they’re not SEs).  
- If you want to include SEs, you must compute them from the underlying data/model output—but they **won’t match the PDF** because the PDF doesn’t provide them. So to “match the true results,” **do not show SEs**.

---

### 2) Variable-name mismatches (labels vs what Table 1 uses)

These aren’t fatal statistically, but they *are* mismatches relative to the “true” table presentation.

**Mismatch B — Different variable labels.**  
- **Generated terms:** `educ`, `income_pc`, `prestg80`, `conservative_protestant`, `no_religion`, `political_intolerance`  
- **True Table 1 labels:** Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Political intolerance

**Fix:**  
Map internal names to Table 1 labels when rendering:
- `educ` → **Education**  
- `income_pc` → **Household income per capita**  
- `prestg80` → **Occupational prestige**  
- `conservative_protestant` → **Conservative Protestant**  
- `no_religion` → **No religion**  
- `political_intolerance` → **Political intolerance**  

(Your generated output is mostly a labeling mismatch here—not a modeling mismatch.)

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **every coefficient mismatch** between generated standardized betas and the true standardized coefficients.

#### Model 1 (SES)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.332 | -0.322 | too negative by -0.010 |
| HH income pc | -0.034 | -0.037 | not negative enough by +0.003 |
| Occ prestige | 0.029 | 0.016 | too positive by +0.013 |
| Constant | 11.086 | 10.920 | too high |

Also:
- **Generated N=758 vs True N=787** (see section 5). This alone can change coefficients.

**Fix:** match the sample and coding to the article (especially listwise deletion rules, year filter, and variable construction).

---

#### Model 2 (Demographic)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.259 | -0.246 | too negative |
| HH income pc | -0.050 | -0.054 | not negative enough |
| Occ prestige | 0.006 | -0.006 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.089 (**sig**) | -0.083 (*sig*) | magnitude + stars differ |
| Age | 0.129 | 0.140 | too small |
| Black | 0.030 | 0.029 | close (minor) |
| **Hispanic** | **dropped** | -0.029 | **missing coefficient** |
| Other race | 0.001 | 0.005 | too small |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.067 | 0.059 | too large |
| No religion | -0.004 | -0.012 | too close to 0 |
| Southern | 0.084 (*sig*) | 0.097 (**sig**) | magnitude + stars differ |
| Constant | 8.788 | 8.507 | too high |
| R² | 0.145 | 0.151 | too low |
| Adj R² | 0.134 | 0.139 | too low |
| N | 756 | 756 | matches |

**Fixes (main ones):**
1) **Do not drop “Hispanic”** (see section 4).  
2) Ensure the *exact* demographic model coding matches the paper (race category coding, reference group, and whether race is mutually exclusive).
3) Ensure standardized coefficients are computed the same way as the authors (see section 6).

#### Model 3 (Political intolerance)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Education | -0.161 | -0.151 | too negative |
| HH income pc | -0.012 | -0.009 | too negative |
| Occ prestige | -0.008 | -0.022 | not negative enough |
| Female | -0.114 (*sig*) | -0.095 (*sig*) | too negative |
| Age | 0.060 (ns) | 0.110 (*sig*) | **major mismatch** (size + significance) |
| Black | 0.062 | 0.049 | too large |
| **Hispanic** | **dropped** | 0.031 | **missing coefficient** |
| Other race | 0.051 | 0.053 | close |
| Cons. Prot. | 0.053 | 0.066 | too small |
| No religion | 0.020 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.087 (ns) | 0.121 (**sig**) | too small + wrong significance |
| Political intolerance | 0.166 (**sig**) | 0.164 (***sig**) | stars differ |
| Constant | 7.355 | 6.516 | too high |
| R² | 0.139 | 0.169 | **too low** |
| Adj R² | 0.117 | 0.148 | **too low** |
| N | 426 | 503 | **too few cases** |

**Fix:** Your Model 3 estimation sample is not the same as the article’s (N=426 vs 503). Fix the sample construction first; until then, coefficient differences (especially age, southern, R²) are expected.

### 4) The biggest concrete discrepancy: **Hispanic is incorrectly coded/dropped**

**Mismatch C — “Hispanic” is dropped for no variance in generated models.**  
- **Generated diagnostics:** “Not available in provided mapping; set to 0.0 for all cases … predictor dropped for no variance.”
- **True:** Hispanic appears in Models 2 and 3 with nonzero coefficients (so it must vary and must be included).

**Fix:**  
- Build `hispanic` correctly from the source data. You cannot set it to all zeros.
- Common correct approach (depends on dataset):  
  - If there is a Hispanic ethnicity indicator: `hispanic = 1 if Hispanic, else 0` regardless of race, *or*  
  - If Table 1 treats Hispanic as a race category, ensure mutually exclusive categories and a correct reference group (e.g., White omitted).
- After fixing, re-run Models 2 and 3; coefficients and N may change.

---

### 5) Sample size (N) mismatches / listwise deletion differences

**Mismatch D — Model N differs from the true table (Models 1 and 3).**
- **Model 1:** Generated **758** vs True **787**
- **Model 2:** Generated **756** vs True **756** (matches)
- **Model 3:** Generated **426** vs True **503**

**Fix:** replicate the paper’s exact inclusion rules:
- Same survey year restriction (you mention `N_year_1993=1606`; confirm paper uses 1993 only).
- Same dependent-variable construction (“number of genres disliked”): especially how missing items are handled.
- Same handling of missingness: the paper likely uses **listwise deletion within each model**, but your construction of DV and/or polintol may be more restrictive than theirs.

Concretely for Model 3: you are likely dropping many cases because `political_intolerance` is missing or because your DV is restricted to “complete music_18” in a way the authors did not require. To match N=503, loosen/align the rule to what the authors did.

---

### 6) Standardization method (can shift betas and stars)

**Mismatch E — Standardized coefficients likely not computed exactly as the authors did.**
- **Generated:** “beta=b*SD(x)/SD(y) on each model estimation sample.”
- **True:** Table shows standardized coefficients, but authors may have standardized variables differently (e.g., using sample weights, using full-sample SDs, or standardizing before listwise deletion).

**Fix:** determine the paper’s standardization convention and match it. Typical options:
1) **Within-model standardization (your approach):** SDs computed on the estimation sample for that model.  
2) **Common-SD standardization:** SDs computed on a common baseline sample (e.g., Model 1 sample) and reused.  
3) **Weighted standardization:** SDs incorporate survey weights.

If the dataset is from a complex survey (common in sociology), failure to use weights can affect coefficients, R², and p-values.

---

### 7) Significance stars / inference mismatches

Even where coefficients are close, stars differ:
- Female in Model 2: generated ** vs true *
- Southern in Model 2: generated * vs true **
- Political intolerance in Model 3: generated ** vs true ***
- Age in Model 3: generated ns vs true *

**Fix:** You must match the paper’s inference procedure:
- Use the same **standard errors** approach (possibly robust, possibly survey-adjusted).
- Use the same **two-tailed thresholds** (you did, but the p-values won’t match if SEs differ).
- Use the same **weights / design correction** if applicable.

But note: since Table 1 doesn’t print SEs, you can only match stars by matching their SE/p-value method.

---

### 8) Interpretation mismatch (what the coefficients represent)

**Mismatch F — Generated table mixes standardized betas with raw-model p-values/SE logic without clarity.**
- The output says the table prints standardized betas only, but still provides stars from “raw OLS p-values.” That’s fine *if* the p-values come from the same model, but it’s easy to misinterpret as “SE of standardized beta” (which is not what the paper presents).

**Fix:**  
- Make explicit in the table note: “Entries are standardized coefficients; significance stars are based on tests of the corresponding unstandardized coefficients from the same model.”  
- Or match the PDF strictly: show standardized coefficients + stars only, with no mention/printing of SEs.

---

## Priority order to make the generated analysis match the true table

1) **Fix Hispanic coding** so it varies and is included (Models 2 & 3).  
2) **Match sample sizes** exactly (especially Model 3: 503; Model 1: 787) by aligning DV construction and missing-data rules to the paper.  
3) **Match weighting/SE approach** (OLS vs survey-weighted; robust vs conventional), to align stars and possibly coefficients.  
4) **Ensure standardization convention** matches the authors.  
5) **Render the table like the PDF**: standardized coefficients only; no SE rows.

If you share the code (or at least the exact variable construction rules you used for DV, political intolerance, and race/ethnicity), I can point to the exact lines that are causing the N drops and the Hispanic “all zeros” failure.
