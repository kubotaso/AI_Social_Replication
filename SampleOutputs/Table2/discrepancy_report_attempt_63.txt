Score: 34/100
============================================================

### 0) First-order discrepancy: you are comparing the wrong models/samples
- **Generated models:** “Model 2A” and “Model 2B” with **N = 257** each, and “no religion” **dropped for no variation**.
- **True table (Bryson 1996 Table 2):** **Model 1** (minority-linked genres) **N = 644** and **Model 2** (remaining genres) **N = 605**, and **No religion is included** with nonzero coefficients.

This single mismatch in analytic sample (and likely missing survey weights / sample restrictions) guarantees coefficient differences.

**Fix:** replicate Bryson’s analytic samples and design:
1. Use the same **year (1993)** and **subsample restrictions** as Bryson (e.g., adults, valid responses, etc.).
2. Do **not** listwise-delete down to 257 unless the paper did; identify what extra missingness your pipeline introduced (likely DENOM/ETHNIC handling—see below).
3. Apply **the same weighting scheme** (GSS weight variable if used; Bryson likely used a weight). Even if standardized betas are reported, weights can change them.
4. Ensure **DV construction** matches (same genre set, same coding of “dislike,” same missing handling).

## 1) Mismatches in variable names / coding (construction errors)

### 1.1 “Hispanic” coding differs from the paper
- **Generated:** `Hispanic (derived from ETHNIC in {15..38} if ETHNIC present; else missing)`  
  That “else missing” rule will **massively shrink N** and can distort coefficients by nonrandom missingness.
- **True:** Hispanic is included for N=644/605; Bryson’s coding almost certainly did **not** set non-ETHNIC respondents to missing.

**Fix:** Construct Hispanic using the same source Bryson used (likely a race/ethnicity indicator available for everyone in that year), or:
- If ETHNIC is missing for some cases, treat them as **non-Hispanic** only when that is valid in the survey design (often it is), *or* use another variable (e.g., `HISPANIC`/`ETHNIC` recode with explicit “not Hispanic” category), not “missing if absent.”

### 1.2 “Conservative Protestant” proxy is not Bryson’s variable
- **Generated:** `RELIG==1 & DENOM==1 (Baptist) if DENOM present; else missing`
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant” is a **religious tradition** classification, not “Baptist only,” and not “missing if DENOM absent.”

This will both (a) misclassify and (b) create missingness → smaller N and wrong coefficient.

**Fix:** Use a standard conservative Protestant tradition coding (Steensland et al.-style RELTRAD, or Bryson’s own scheme). At minimum:
- Use RELIG + DENOM to classify **Evangelical/Conservative Protestant**, not only Baptists.
- Do not set it to missing when DENOM is absent; handle “no denomination” properly.

### 1.3 “No religion” incorrectly dropped (no variation)
- **Generated:** `No religion (RELIG==4) NaN; dropped (no variation)`
- **True:** No religion is **included** with coefficients (0.057 in Model 1; 0.024 in Model 2).

If your analytic sample has zero cases with RELIG==4, your sample is not the paper’s sample (or your RELIG coding is wrong).

**Fix:**
- Recheck RELIG coding (is “no religion” actually 4 in 1993 GSS? coding can differ by year).
- Do not condition religion variables on DENOM availability in a way that filters out “no religion.”
- Fix sample selection so “no religion” respondents are present (should be, in GSS).

### 1.4 “Southern (REGION==3)” likely mis-coded
- **Generated:** South = REGION==3.
- **True:** Bryson’s “Southern” usually corresponds to **Census region South**; in GSS, region categories often are 1=New England, 2=Mid-Atlantic, 3=E. North Central, 4=W. North Central, 5=South Atlantic, 6=E. South Central, 7=W. South Central, 8=Mountain, 9=Pacific (varies). REGION==3 may be *not* South.

**Fix:** Verify the actual GSS coding for that year and define South as the correct set of categories (often 5/6/7, etc.), not a single value.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (variable-by-variable)

### Model 1 in paper vs Generated “Model 2A” (minority-linked DV)
Paper (Model 1) coefficients vs Generated (Model 2A):

- **Racism score:** True **0.130** (**) vs Gen **0.142** (*)  
  Direction matches; magnitude slightly off; significance differs. Likely sample/weighting/coding differences.
- **Education:** True **-0.175*** vs Gen **-0.253***  
  Too strong in generated → sample restriction and/or standardization difference.
- **Income pc:** True **-0.037** vs Gen **-0.017**  
  Weaker in generated.
- **Occ prestige:** True **-0.020** vs Gen **+0.056** (sign flips)  
  Strong sign error suggests either prestige variable mismatch (wrong PREST variable/year), different coding, or sample artifact.
- **Female:** True **-0.057** vs Gen **-0.036**  
  Smaller magnitude.
- **Age:** True **0.163*** vs Gen **0.167** (**)  
  Close magnitude; significance differs (again likely N/weights).
- **Black:** True **-0.132*** vs Gen **-0.174** (*)  
  Too negative and much less significant than expected given paper has ***; indicates reduced N and/or wrong standard errors/p-values.
- **Hispanic:** True **-0.058** vs Gen **-0.058**  
  This is essentially identical—good sign, but could be coincidental given your Hispanic coding issue.
- **Other race:** True **-0.017** vs Gen **+0.007** (sign flip, small)  
- **Conservative Protestant:** True **0.063** vs Gen **0.102**  
  Larger in generated—likely because your “Baptist-only” proxy picks a different group.
- **No religion:** True **0.057** vs Gen **dropped**  
  Direct mismatch.
- **Southern:** True **0.024** vs Gen **-0.057** (sign flip)  
  Points to wrong South coding.

**Fix summary for Model 1:** correct sample size/weights, fix South coding, fix prestige variable selection, fix religion classification, fix Hispanic missingness.

---

### Model 2 in paper vs Generated “Model 2B” (remaining-genres DV)
Paper (Model 2) vs Gen (Model 2B):

- **Racism:** True **0.080** (ns) vs Gen **-0.007** (ns)  
  Direction mismatch: sign flips to ~0. This is not a rounding issue—again sample/coding mismatch.
- **Education:** True **-0.242*** vs Gen **-0.158*** (only *)  
  Much smaller magnitude and weaker significance in generated.
- **Income pc:** True **-0.065** vs Gen **-0.076**  
  Close.
- **Occ prestige:** True **0.005** vs Gen **-0.082** (sign flip, sizeable)  
  Major mismatch; again likely wrong prestige variable/coding/sample.
- **Female:** True **-0.070** vs Gen **-0.092**  
  Somewhat larger negative.
- **Age:** True **0.126** (**) vs Gen **0.109** (ns)  
  Similar magnitude but different significance due to N/weights/SE computation.
- **Black:** True **0.042** vs Gen **0.046**  
  Very close.
- **Hispanic:** True **-0.029** vs Gen **-0.102**  
  Much more negative in generated—consistent with your Hispanic coding that induces selection/misclassification.
- **Other race:** True **0.047** vs Gen **0.140** (*)  
  Too large.
- **Conservative Protestant:** True **0.048** vs Gen **0.124**  
  Too large—again proxy mismatch.
- **No religion:** True **0.024** vs Gen **dropped**  
  Direct mismatch.
- **Southern:** True **0.069** vs Gen **0.105**  
  Larger but same direction (however your South coding still suspect).

**Fix summary for Model 2:** same as above, especially Hispanic, prestige, religion coding, South coding, and sample/weights.

---

## 3) Standard errors: generated output claims sig stars but true table has no SEs
- **True:** “does not report standard errors” (only standardized betas + stars).
- **Generated:** shows stars but no SEs either—however the *meaning* of the stars must match Bryson’s p-values, which depend on the correct N, model specification, and possibly survey design.

**Fix:** To match Bryson’s stars:
1. Ensure the same **analytic N**.
2. Ensure the same **model specification** and **coding**.
3. Use the same **test assumptions** (OLS, two-tailed).  
4. If Bryson used weights, compute p-values with weights as he did (and if he used design-based SEs, match that—though Table 2 likely uses conventional OLS SEs).

If your goal is to match Table 2 exactly, you should **not introduce SEs**; just compute standardized betas and then compute p-values in the same way Bryson did (but the real driver is the sample/coding mismatch).

## 4) Interpretation mismatches / labeling mismatches

### 4.1 Model numbering mismatch
- **Generated:** “Model 2A / Model 2B”
- **True:** “Model 1 / Model 2”

**Fix:** Rename your models to align with the paper:
- Generated Model 2A → **Table 2 Model 1**
- Generated Model 2B → **Table 2 Model 2**

### 4.2 Constant values don’t match
- **Generated constants:** 2.664 (Model2A), 5.357 (Model2B)
- **True constants:** 2.415 (Model 1), 7.860 (Model 2)

Because these are *unstandardized intercepts* while predictors are standardized betas (mixed reporting), intercepts are highly sensitive to DV coding and sample. Your DV construction and/or sample is not matching.

**Fix:** Recreate DV exactly as Bryson did (same “dislike” threshold, same genre list, same missing rules) and use the correct sample.

---

## 5) Practical checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996)

1. **Rebuild DVs exactly**
   - Confirm the **6 “minority-linked” genres** and the **12 remaining genres** match Bryson’s list.
   - Confirm “dislike” coding (e.g., dislike vs like vs neutral; whether “don’t know” is missing).
   - Confirm the DV is a **count** and ranges match (0–6, 0–12).

2. **Use Bryson’s analytic samples**
   - Target **N=644** for Model 1 DV and **N=605** for Model 2 DV.
   - Audit which variable(s) cause your drop to N=257 (likely ETHNIC/DENOM missingness rules).

3. **Fix key predictors**
   - **Hispanic:** do not set to missing when ETHNIC not present; use a variable defined for all cases.
   - **Conservative Protestant:** use a proper religious tradition classification; don’t proxy as “Baptist only.”
   - **No religion:** verify coding; include it (do not drop).
   - **Southern:** recode correctly using proper region categories.
   - **Occupational prestige:** ensure you’re using the same prestige measure Bryson used (and correct year/version; PRESTG80 may not be the one or may require cleaning).

4. **Match estimation details**
   - Standardize predictors the same way Bryson did (z-scores) to produce standardized betas.
   - Apply the same weights if used.
   - Use OLS with the same inclusion rules.

If you want, paste (a) your exact variable mapping to GSS names, (b) your DV construction rules, and (c) your sample filter code; I can pinpoint which step is producing the N collapse and the sign flips (prestige, South) and specify the precise recodes.
