============================================================

### 1) Sample size / model fit mismatches (major)

**Mismatch**
- **N**: Generated uses **261 (Model 1)** and **259 (Model 2)** vs true **644** and **605**.
- **R² / Adj. R²**: Generated **0.178 / 0.142** (M1) and **0.151 / 0.114** (M2) vs true **0.145 / 0.129** and **0.147 / 0.130**.
- **Constant**: Generated **2.593*** and **5.185*** vs true **2.415*** and **7.860** (note: in the paper the Model 2 constant is shown as 7.860 with no stars).

**Why this happens**
- You are not using the same dataset, year(s), weighting, missing-data rules, and/or variable construction as Bryson (1996). The analytic sample shown in the generated output is far smaller and clearly not the published GSS sample.

**How to fix**
1. **Use the identical data source and wave(s)** Bryson used (GSS mid-1990s music module; exact year(s) matter).
2. **Reproduce the paper’s case selection**: same age restrictions (if any), same handling of “don’t know,” “not applicable,” refusals, and item nonresponse.
3. **Apply weights** if Bryson did (GSS analyses often use WTSSALL/WTSSNR depending on design). If you run unweighted when the paper is weighted (or vice versa), coefficients and N won’t match.
4. **Recreate the two DVs exactly** (see section 4 below). If your DV composition differs, fit stats and constants will differ even if Xs match.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (variable-by-variable)

Below I compare **standardized coefficients** (the paper reports standardized OLS betas).

#### Model 1 coefficients (DV: minority-linked 6 genres)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.140* | 0.130** | size slightly high; **sig level wrong** |
| Education | -0.260*** | -0.175*** | **too negative** |
| Income pc | -0.012 | -0.037 | too close to zero |
| Occ prestige | 0.058 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.034 | -0.057 | smaller magnitude |
| Age | 0.175** | 0.163*** | similar size; **sig wrong** |
| Black | -0.177* | -0.132*** | **too negative; sig wrong** |
| Hispanic | -0.007 | -0.058 | far too close to zero |
| Other race | -0.005 | -0.017 | too close to zero |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.120 | 0.063 | **too large** |
| No religion | dropped (NaN) | 0.057 | **should not be dropped** |
| Southern | -0.059 | 0.024 | **wrong sign** |
| Constant | 2.593*** | 2.415*** | too high |

#### Model 2 coefficients (DV: remaining 12 genres)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.013 | 0.080 | **wrong sign and magnitude** |
| Education | -0.165* | -0.242*** | **not negative enough; sig wrong** |
| Income pc | -0.077 | -0.065 | close-ish (direction matches) |
| Occ prestige | -0.079 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.082 | -0.070 | close-ish |
| Age | 0.127* | 0.126** | size matches; **sig wrong** |
| Black | 0.039 | 0.042 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.023 | -0.029 | close-ish |
| Other race | 0.122* | 0.047 | **too large** (and sig differs) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.142* | 0.048 | **too large** |
| No religion | dropped (NaN) | 0.024 | **should not be dropped** |
| Southern | 0.104 | 0.069 | somewhat high |
| Constant | 5.185*** | 7.860 | **far too low; sig presentation differs** |

**How to fix coefficient mismatches**
- These patterns (wrong sign on prestige & southern; racism flipping sign in Model 2; big education gap; “no religion” dropped) strongly indicate **your variables are not constructed/coded the same way** and/or you are using a **different sample**.
- Rebuild each variable to match Bryson’s definitions and reference categories (see next sections), then re-run on the correct sample/weights.

---

### 3) Standard errors mismatch (conceptual/reporting error)

**Mismatch**
- The prompt asks to compare standard errors, but:
  - **Generated output provides no SEs**, only betas and significance stars.
  - **True Table 2 provides no SEs either**; it reports standardized coefficients only.

**How to fix**
- If you want to match the paper: **do not report SEs**; report standardized betas with the same star cutoffs.
- If you want to add SEs: you *can*, but then it will no longer “match Table 2,” because Table 2 does not contain them. You’d need to clearly label them as “not in Bryson (1996).”

---

### 4) DV construction/scale mismatches (likely driving big differences)

**Mismatch**
- The DV labels match, but the generated DV variables look like **small integer counts** (e.g., `dv1_minority6_dislikes` ranges 0–6; `dv2_remaining12_dislikes` ranges 0–12).
- Bryson’s table is consistent with **additive indices**, but to match coefficients/constants you must match **exact coding of “dislike”** (e.g., 1–5 like/dislike scale recoding, what counts as “dislike,” how neutral is treated, etc.).

**How to fix**
1. Confirm the original music rating response categories and **recode exactly** as Bryson did.
2. Ensure the two indices are created from the **same exact genre lists**:
   - Model 1 index: Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin.
   - Model 2 index: the other 12 genres (verify the exact set from the module).
3. Handle missing genre ratings exactly: Bryson may require a minimum number answered or use listwise deletion across all genres used in the index.

### 5) Variable name mismatches / ambiguous coding

These aren’t just cosmetic—several imply definitional drift.

**Mismatch / issue**
- Generated uses labels like:
  - “Hispanic (from ETHNIC; coding-dependent)” (ambiguous)
  - “Conservative Protestant (RELIG==1 & DENOM==1 proxy)” (explicitly a proxy)
  - “Southern (REGION==3)” (may not match paper’s South definition)
- True table uses clean categories: Racism score, Education, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern.

**How to fix**
- Recreate *exact* indicators used in Bryson:
  - **Race/ethnicity**: ensure Hispanic is defined the same way (GSS has multiple ethnicity/race variables; using `ETHNIC` “coding-dependent” is a red flag). Bryson’s “Hispanic” typically means a Hispanic origin indicator; confirm which variable/year measure he used.
  - **Conservative Protestant**: do **not** use an ad hoc RELIG/DENOM proxy. Use the standard fundamentalist/evangelical/conservative Protestant classification (often derived from denominational codes via RELTRAD-type schemes). If the paper defines it differently, follow that.
  - **Southern**: verify whether it is “South” Census region or a different coding (sometimes South vs non-South, sometimes includes Border states depending on scheme).
  - **No religion**: must be a valid category with variation (see next section).

---

### 6) “No religion” dropped due to “no variation” (definite error)

**Mismatch**
- Generated: **No religion dropped (no variation)** in both models.
- True: No religion is included with coefficients **0.057 (M1)** and **0.024 (M2)**.

**Why this happens**
- You likely coded `no_religion` incorrectly so that it is all 0s (or all 1s) in your analytic sample, possibly because:
  - you filtered the sample in a way that excludes nonreligious respondents,
  - you used the wrong RELIG coding,
  - you inadvertently recoded missing as a category and then dropped,
  - or your “no religion” condition doesn’t match the GSS coding (RELIG categories can vary across years).

**How to fix**
- Verify frequencies **before modeling**:
  - `table(RELIG)` (or the relevant variable) on the analytic sample.
  - `table(no_religion)` should have both 0 and 1.
- Correct the dummy definition to match Bryson’s:
  - e.g., `no_religion = 1 if RELIG == "None"` (exact numeric code depends on the wave).
- Only drop a category if Bryson did (he did not).

### 7) Significance-star mismatches

Even where betas are close, stars often differ.

**Mismatch examples**
- Model 1 racism: generated `*`, true `**`.
- Model 1 age: generated `**`, true `***`.
- Model 1 black: generated `*`, true `***`.
- Model 2 age: generated `*`, true `**`.
- Model 2 education: generated `*`, true `***`.

**Why this happens**
- Different N, weights, and variable construction will change p-values.
- Also possible: you are computing significance for **standardized** coefficients incorrectly (should be same p-value as unstandardized slope in the same model), or using robust SEs vs classical OLS, etc.

**How to fix**
1. Match **sample and weights** first (this is the main driver).
2. Use the same inference method:
   - If Bryson used classical OLS SEs, don’t switch to robust/clustered without noting it.
3. Ensure your star mapping matches the paper: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001 (two-tailed).

### 8) Interpretation mismatch (what your generated results would imply vs the true table)

**Mismatch**
- Generated Model 2 implies racism has ~zero/negative association with disliking the remaining genres (beta = -0.013), while true table shows a **positive** association (0.080).
- Generated flips signs for occupational prestige (both models vs true) and for Southern in Model 1.

**How to fix**
- Do not interpret any substantive pattern until:
  1) the DV indices are identically coded,
  2) the religious tradition and Hispanic coding are corrected,
  3) the correct GSS sample and weights are used.
- Once corrected, your interpretation should align with Table 2’s directional findings (e.g., education strongly reduces “dislike” in both models; age increases; racism positive in Model 1 and also positive in Model 2 though smaller and not significant in the printed table).

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996) Table 2

1. **Data**: use the same GSS year(s)/module as Bryson; no accidental subsetting.
2. **Weights**: apply the same weighting scheme as the paper (or confirm unweighted).
3. **DV indices**: reconstruct the 6-genre and 12-genre “dislike” indices with identical recoding and missing rules.
4. **Key predictors**:
   - Racism scale: same items, same range, same averaging/summing.
   - Conservative Protestant: use the paper’s classification (not a RELIG/DENOM shortcut).
   - Hispanic: use the same Hispanic-origin indicator as Bryson.
   - Southern: match the paper’s region coding.
   - No religion: correctly define and keep it in the model.
5. **Output**: report **standardized OLS coefficients** (no SEs), with the same star thresholds.

If you share (a) the code you used to build the two DVs, (b) which GSS year(s), and (c) how you created “conservative Protestant,” “Hispanic,” and “no religion,” I can pinpoint exactly which construction choices are causing each coefficient/sign flip.
