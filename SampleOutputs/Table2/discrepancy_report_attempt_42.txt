Score: 34/100
============================================================

### 1) Model naming / mapping is wrong

**Mismatch**
- Generated output labels the two regressions as **Model 2A** (minority-linked 6) and **Model 2B** (remaining 12).
- True table calls them **Model 1** (minority-linked 6) and **Model 2** (remaining 12).

**Fix**
- Relabel:
  - Generated “Model 2A” → **Model 1**
  - Generated “Model 2B” → **Model 2**
- Make sure any narrative refers to “Model 1” and “Model 2” exactly as in Bryson (1996).

---

### 2) Sample sizes (N) are wildly incorrect

**Mismatch**
- Generated N: **261** (minority-linked 6) and **259** (remaining 12).
- True N: **644** (Model 1) and **605** (Model 2).

**Fix**
- Your analytic sample construction is not matching the paper’s (almost certainly due to filtering, missing data handling, and/or using the wrong dataset/year/wave).
- To match Bryson:
  1. Use the **same source data** Bryson used (GSS/music items from the relevant year(s) in the paper).
  2. Reproduce the paper’s **missing-data rule** (likely listwise deletion on all variables in the model, but on the *correct* variables/items).
  3. Ensure your DV construction uses **all respondents who answered the music battery** (you may be accidentally dropping many cases via merges, recodes, or requiring non-missing on items that weren’t required in the paper).

Until N matches (644 / 605), coefficients will not match.

### 3) R² / Adjusted R² do not match

**Mismatch**
- Generated:
  - Minority-linked 6: R² **0.182**, Adj **0.145**
  - Remaining 12: R² **0.152**, Adj **0.114**
- True:
  - Model 1: R² **0.145**, Adj **0.129**
  - Model 2: R² **0.147**, Adj **0.130**

**Fix**
- This is a consequence of the **wrong sample** and likely **wrong coding** of one or more predictors (religion dummies, region, etc.).
- Once (a) the sample and (b) variable coding match, R² should align closely.

---

### 4) Constant/intercept is wrong (especially Model 2)

**Mismatch**
- Generated constants:
  - Minority-linked 6: **2.647*** (true **2.415***)
  - Remaining 12: **5.328*** (true **7.860**, and notably the table shows no stars)
  
**Fix**
- Intercepts depend on DV scaling/coding and included predictors.
- The Model 2 intercept discrepancy strongly suggests your **DV for “remaining 12” is not constructed the same way** (wrong set of genres, wrong “dislike” definition, different missing handling, etc.).
- Rebuild DVs to match exactly:
  - DV1 = count of **dislikes** across the 6 “minority-linked” genres as defined in Bryson.
  - DV2 = count of **dislikes** across the *other 12* genres (ensure the set of 18 total genres matches the paper’s battery).

---

### 5) “No religion” is incorrectly dropped (should not be)

**Mismatch**
- Generated: **No religion (RELIG==4)** is `NaN` and marked “dropped (no variation)” in both models.
- True: “No religion” has coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**

**Fix**
- Your `no_religion` dummy has become constant in your analytic sample (likely all 0), which is a **coding/filtering error**, not a real property of the population.
- Common causes and fixes:
  1. **Wrong RELIG coding**: In GSS, RELIG codes are typically 1=Protestant, 2=Catholic, 3=Jewish, 4=None, 5=Other (verify for the year). Confirm RELIG==4 really means “None” in your extract.
  2. **Sample restriction inadvertently excludes “None”**: Check any filters like `RELIG==1` somewhere upstream, or merges that drop cases with RELIG not in a subset.
  3. **Recode after listwise deletion**: If you compute `no_religion` after dropping missings but the drop step used an incorrect condition (e.g., `RELIG.notna() & RELIG!=4`), you can eliminate “None.”
- Correct implementation: create religion dummies from the full sample *before* deletion, verify variation, then listwise delete on the model variables.

---

### 6) Conservative Protestant variable is not comparable to Bryson’s

**Mismatch**
- Generated uses a **proxy**: `RELIG==1 & DENOM in {1,6}`.
- True table variable is “Conservative Protestant” (Bryson’s operationalization may differ).

**Fix**
- You must replicate Bryson’s definition (often based on denominational family/fundamentalist classification, not just a couple of DENOM codes).
- Action:
  - Read Bryson’s appendix/methods for how “Conservative Protestant” is coded.
  - Implement the **same coding scheme** (potentially using a denomination-to-family crosswalk used in the 1990s GSS literature).
- Without matching this, the coefficient will not match (and yours differs: 0.116 vs true 0.063 in Model 1; 0.116 vs true 0.048 in Model 2).

---

### 7) Southern coding likely wrong (sign and magnitude differ)

**Mismatch**
- Generated Southern:
  - Minority-linked 6: **-0.039** (true **+0.024**)
  - Remaining 12: **+0.134*** (true **+0.069**, not starred)
  
**Fix**
- Verify REGION coding and the “South” category used by Bryson.
  - In GSS, REGION is typically 1=NE, 2=MW, 3=South, 4=West (but verify year).
- Ensure:
  - `southern = 1` iff REGION corresponds to “South” in the used coding.
  - You didn’t accidentally code “South” as REGION==something else, or invert the dummy, or use a different region variable (e.g., `REGION` vs `REGION1` in some extracts).

---

### 8) Education coefficients do not match (both models)

**Mismatch**
- Generated Education:
  - Minority-linked 6: **-0.266*** (true **-0.175***)
  - Remaining 12: **-0.177*** (true **-0.242***)

**Fix**
- This pattern is consistent with **not reproducing the same sample and/or DV coding**.
- Also verify education measure:
  - Bryson’s “Education” may be years (EDUC), but confirm no transformations (e.g., centering) were applied.
- Once N and DV match, these should move toward the reported values.

---

### 9) Racism coefficient significance is wrong in Model 1 and sign/size wrong in Model 2

**Mismatch**
- Model 1 (minority-linked 6):
  - Generated racism: **0.129***with one star* (p<.05)
  - True: **0.130\*\*** (p<.01)
- Model 2 (remaining 12):
  - Generated racism: **-0.019** (negative, near zero)
  - True: **+0.080** (positive)

**Fix**
- First model: the coefficient is close, but the **significance marking is not comparable** because:
  - Bryson prints significance based on **his** standard errors and N (644), while your N is 261.
- Second model: sign flip indicates **major mismatch** in DV construction and/or sample and/or racism scale construction.
  - Confirm racism scale is **0–5 sum of five dichotomies** exactly as Bryson did (same items, same dichotomization direction, same missing rule).
  - Confirm DV2 is exactly “12 remaining genres” and “dislike” coding matches.

---

### 10) Several predictor coefficients differ in sign and magnitude (Model 1 especially)

Below are direct coefficient mismatches (Generated vs True):

#### Model 1 / minority-linked 6
- Income: **-0.008** vs **-0.037**
- Prestige: **+0.053** vs **-0.020** (sign mismatch)
- Female: **-0.036** vs **-0.057**
- Age: **+0.171** vs **+0.163** (close; but stars differ: you have **, Bryson has ***)
- Black: **-0.160** vs **-0.132** (and stars differ: you have *, Bryson has ***)
- Conservative Protestant: **+0.116** vs **+0.063**
- No religion: **dropped** vs **+0.057**
- Southern: **-0.039** vs **+0.024** (sign mismatch)
- Constant: **2.647** vs **2.415**

#### Model 2 / remaining 12
- Education: **-0.177** vs **-0.242**
- Income: **-0.079** vs **-0.065** (close-ish)
- Prestige: **-0.080** vs **+0.005** (sign mismatch)
- Female: **-0.086** vs **-0.070**
- Age: **+0.118** vs **+0.126** (stars differ: none vs **)
- Black: **+0.068** vs **+0.042**
- Other race: **+0.112** vs **+0.047**
- Conservative Protestant: **+0.116** vs **+0.048**
- No religion: **dropped** vs **+0.024**
- Southern: **+0.134\*** vs **+0.069**
- Constant: **5.328** vs **7.860**

**Fix (global)**
These are not “rounding” issues; they indicate:
1) wrong N/sample, and
2) at least one of: wrong DV definitions, wrong racism scale, wrong Conservative Protestant coding, wrong region coding, wrong prestige/income variable treatment.

---

### 11) Standard errors: generated analysis can’t “match” Bryson by adding SEs

**Mismatch**
- You were asked to compare standard errors, but **true results include no SEs** (explicitly noted).
- Generated tables also do not report SEs; only standardized betas and stars.

**Fix**
- Don’t invent SE comparisons. If you need to align with the paper, remove any SE/t-stat discussion entirely.
- If you want to compute SEs for your replication, present them as **additional** results, but clearly label them as “not reported in Bryson (1996).”

---

### 12) Interpretation/significance logic must be tied to Bryson’s p-values, not yours

**Mismatch**
- Your star patterns (e.g., racism in Model 1; age/black significance levels) don’t match the table because your estimates come from a different N and possibly different model.

**Fix**
- If your goal is “generated analysis matches,” then:
  1. First replicate coefficients with the correct sample/coding (N=644/605).
  2. Then compute p-values; the stars should align closely.
  3. If minor differences remain due to software/weighting, note them.

## What to change in your code/workflow (checklist)

1. **Data source/year**: confirm you’re using the same GSS year(s) and same music battery as Bryson.
2. **DV construction**:
   - Identify the exact 18 genres in Bryson.
   - Identify the exact 6 “minority-linked” genres and the remaining 12.
   - Reproduce “dislike” coding (which response categories count as “dislike”?).
   - Apply Bryson’s missing-data rule for DV counts.
3. **Racism scale**:
   - Use the exact five items and dichotomization thresholds.
   - Sum to 0–5.
   - Match Bryson’s handling of missing items (e.g., require all 5 answered vs allow partial with imputation—whatever he did).
4. **Religion variables**:
   - Implement “Conservative Protestant” exactly per Bryson.
   - Implement “No religion” correctly and ensure it varies in the analytic sample.
5. **Region**:
   - Verify REGION coding; set South correctly.
6. **Listwise deletion / weights**:
   - Match Bryson on listwise deletion and any weighting (if he used weights).
7. **Output**:
   - Report standardized coefficients only (as Bryson does).
   - Use Bryson’s model names (Model 1/Model 2), N, R², Adj R².

If you share the exact code you used to (a) build the two DVs and (b) build the racism and religion variables (plus any filters), I can point to the specific lines causing the N collapse and the dummy-drop for “No religion,” which are the two biggest concrete failures visible from the output.
