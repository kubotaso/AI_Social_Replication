Score: 18/100
============================================================

### 1) Fundamental output-format mismatch (SEs/t/p-values should not exist)
**Mismatch**
- **True Table 2 reports only standardized coefficients + significance stars. It does *not* report standard errors, t-stats, or p-values.**
- Your **Generated Results** include `std_err`, `t`, and `p_value` for both models, implying the table contains inferential statistics that can be read off the PDF.

**Fix**
- Remove/ignore `std_err`, `t`, and `p_value` columns entirely when “matching Table 2.”
- If you want SEs/p-values, you must **re-run the regression on the GSS 1993 microdata with the same variable coding and sample restrictions** used by Bryson (1996). Then you can report SEs—but they still won’t “match Table 2” because Table 2 never printed them.

---

### 2) Sample size (N) and fit statistics do not match
#### Model 1
**Mismatch**
- Generated `ModelA_fit`: **N = 203**, R² = **0.166**, Adj R² = **0.118**
- True Model 1: **N = 644**, R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**

#### Model 2
**Mismatch**
- Generated `ModelB_fit`: **N = 197**, R² = **0.196**, Adj R² = **0.149**
- True Model 2: **N = 605**, R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**

**Fix**
- Your analysis is using a **much smaller (and different) estimation sample**. To match Table 2 you must replicate:
  - **GSS 1993** sample (not pooled years unless Bryson did so—Table title says 1993).
  - The **same missing-data handling** (likely listwise deletion on the included variables, but must yield N=644/605).
  - The **same dependent-variable construction** (see section 5).
  - The **same coding** of predictors (esp. religion, race, region).
- After you align the dataset and coding, N and R² should come close to the published values (minor differences can still occur depending on weighting and exact variable construction).

---

### 3) Dropping `no_religion` is wrong (zero-variance error indicates misconstructed variable)
**Mismatch**
- Generated output says `no_religion` was “dropped_zero_variance” in both models.
- True Table 2 includes **No religion** with nonzero coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**

**Fix**
- `no_religion` should be a **dummy indicator** (1 = no religion, 0 = otherwise) and it must vary in the sample.
- Diagnose and fix:
  - Check frequency table of `no_religion` in the analysis sample. If all 0/1, you filtered incorrectly.
  - Ensure you did **not** accidentally subset to only “no religion” respondents or only religious respondents.
  - Ensure “no religion” is not being computed from an already-filtered religion variable (e.g., recoding missing to 0).
  - If religion is multi-category, include dummies correctly and pick a reference category that matches Bryson.

### 4) Coefficients: variable-by-variable mismatches (Model 1)
Below I compare the **paper’s standardized coefficient** to your **ModelA_table_paper_order `coef`** (which appears to be beta_std).

| Variable | True (Model 1) | Generated (Model A) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130** (**) | **0.129851** (no stars) | Value matches; **stars wrong** (see §7) |
| Education | **-0.175*** | **-0.251490** (**) | **Coefficient too negative; star level wrong** |
| HH income per cap | **-0.037** | **0.021517** | **Wrong sign** |
| Occ prestige | **-0.020** | **0.006175** | Wrong sign |
| Female | **-0.057** | **-0.033233** | Magnitude off |
| Age | **0.163*** | **0.151255** (*) | Magnitude slightly off; **stars too weak** |
| Black | **-0.132*** | **-0.149199** (none) | Magnitude close-ish; **stars wrong** |
| Hispanic | **-0.058** | **-0.049914** | Close |
| Other race | **-0.017** | **-0.003730** | Off |
| Cons Protestant | **0.063** | **0.074571** | Close-ish |
| No religion | **0.057** | **NaN / dropped** | **Incorrect (should be included)** |
| Southern | **0.024** | **-0.010731** | **Wrong sign** |
| Constant | **2.415*** | **2.858389*** | Different intercept (often indicates DV construction/sample mismatch) |

**Fix (Model 1)**
- The widespread sign and magnitude differences strongly imply **you are not estimating the same model**:
  1. Rebuild **DV1 exactly**: “number of genres disliked” among the 6 listed genres (rap, reggae, blues/R&B, jazz, gospel, latin).
  2. Use the same **predictor coding** (income per capita, occupation prestige scale, education measure).
  3. Use the correct **sample and missingness** to reach N=644.
  4. Use **standardized coefficients** computed the same way as the paper (see §6).

### 5) Coefficients: variable-by-variable mismatches (Model 2)
Compare true Model 2 vs your generated Model B:

| Variable | True (Model 2) | Generated (Model B) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.080** | **-0.021652** | **Wrong sign** |
| Education | **-0.242*** | **-0.258700** (**) | Close-ish magnitude; **stars wrong** |
| HH income per cap | **-0.065** | **-0.069405** | Close |
| Occ prestige | **0.005** | **-0.095336** | **Very wrong (sign + magnitude)** |
| Female | **-0.070** | **-0.088840** | Somewhat off |
| Age | **0.126** (**) | **-0.004827** | **Wrong sign** |
| Black | **0.042** | **0.065680** | Off |
| Hispanic | **-0.029** | **-0.059801** | More negative |
| Other race | **0.047** | **0.158341** (*) | Too large; stars wrong |
| Cons Protestant | **0.048** | **0.117408** | Too large |
| No religion | **0.024** | **NaN / dropped** | **Incorrect** |
| Southern | **0.069** | **0.198937** (**) | Too large |
| Constant | **7.860** | **7.127766*** | Different; also **paper constant has no stars** |

**Fix (Model 2)**
- Again suggests **DV2 is not the “12 remaining genres” dislike count**, or that key predictors were miscoded (especially **age** and **occupational prestige**, which flip sign drastically).
- Recreate DV2 as a **count of disliked among the other 12 genres** exactly as in the paper and confirm range/mean against what Bryson reports (if available).
- Verify `age_years` is numeric age (not centered, not reversed, not a cohort code).
- Verify occupational prestige uses the correct prestige score (not an occupational category id).

---

### 6) Standardization inconsistency (what “standardized coefficient” means here)
**Mismatch**
- You’re mixing:
  - `ModelA_table_full` shows both `b_unstd` and `beta_std`
  - `ModelA_table_paper_order` uses `coef` that appears to be **beta_std**
- But your betas do not reproduce the paper even when the racism beta does.

**Fix**
- To match Bryson’s “standardized OLS coefficients,” compute betas as:
  \[
  \beta_j = b_j \times \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
  \]
  using the **same estimation sample**.
- Do **not** standardize Y and X *before* listwise deletion on a different subset; SDs must come from the final analytic sample used in the regression.

---

### 7) Significance stars are inconsistent with the paper (and with your own p-values)
**Mismatches**
- Model 1 racism: paper **0.130\*\***, generated shows **no stars** despite your p=0.085 (which wouldn’t justify ** either way).
- Model 1 age: paper **0.163\*\*\***, generated only `*` (p=0.044).
- Model 1 black: paper **-0.132\*\*\***, generated none (p=0.055).
- Model 2 racism: paper has positive 0.080 (no stars); generated negative.
- Model 2 age: paper **0.126\*\***; generated near zero with p=0.948.

**Fix**
- You cannot “fix stars” without fixing the **data/model** first, because stars depend on the correct coefficient and SE.
- Once the regression is replicated on the correct sample, apply the paper’s rule:
  - * p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001 (two-tailed)
- Also note: the paper’s table stars correspond to their (unreported) p-values; you must recompute them from replicated SEs.

---

### 8) Intercept/constant reporting inconsistency
**Mismatch**
- Paper Model 2 constant is **7.860** with **no stars**.
- Generated Model B constant is **7.127766*** (highly significant).
- Paper Model 1 constant **2.415*** vs generated **2.858***.

**Fix**
- Intercepts will differ if:
  - DV counts are constructed differently (most likely here),
  - sample differs (definitely here),
  - or you used different scaling/centering.
- Rebuild DVs and sample first; then check intercepts.

---

### 9) Variable name alignment (mostly OK) but category definitions likely mismatched
**Mismatch risk (interpretation/coding)**
- Names line up superficially (`south`, `cons_protestant`, race dummies), but sign flips for `south`, `occ_prestige`, `age` in Model 2 indicate **coding/reference category problems**.

**Fix**
- Ensure dummies match Bryson’s:
  - Race: white as reference; include indicators for black, hispanic, other.
  - Religion: include conservative Protestant and no religion with the same reference group as paper.
  - South: 1 = Southern, 0 = non-Southern (not reversed).
- Verify you did not include additional controls or different references.

## What to change so the generated analysis matches Table 2
1. **Stop claiming SEs are from the PDF**; remove SE/t/p columns when “matching the paper table.”
2. **Recreate DV1 and DV2 exactly as dislike-count outcomes** for the specified genre sets.
3. Use **GSS 1993** and replicate **sample restrictions + listwise deletion** to get **N=644** (Model1) and **N=605** (Model2).
4. Fix `no_religion` so it varies and is included.
5. Verify coding for **age**, **occupational prestige**, **south**, and income per capita; fix any reversals or wrong variables.
6. Compute **standardized betas** using the SDs from the final analytic sample.
7. After replication, apply the paper’s star thresholds to your recomputed p-values (but do not pretend they came from Table 2).

If you paste your code (or at least: how you built the two DVs, how you coded religion and prestige, and how you filtered to N≈200), I can pinpoint exactly which transformation/filter is causing the massive N drop and the sign reversals.
