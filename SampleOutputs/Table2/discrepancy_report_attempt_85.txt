Score: 47/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name mismatches / construction problems

1. **Hispanic variable**
   - **Generated:** `Hispanic (proxy from ETHNIC; see notes)` (and analytic sample column `hispanic`)
   - **True:** `Hispanic`
   - **Mismatch:** The generated output explicitly uses a *proxy* rather than the table’s variable. That means it is not guaranteed to match Bryson’s coding (and the coefficients won’t match either).
   - **Fix:** Recreate **exactly** Bryson’s Hispanic indicator from the original data and codebook used in the paper (same survey year, same race/ethnicity question, same reference category). Do **not** use an ad-hoc proxy.

2. **Conservative Protestant**
   - **Generated:** `Conservative Protestant (proxy: Protestant & Baptist)` with analytic sample `cons_prot`
   - **True:** `Conservative Protestant`
   - **Mismatch:** “Protestant & Baptist” is not necessarily Bryson’s “Conservative Protestant.” Bryson likely used a denomination/fundamentalist classification (often based on RELTRAD-style groupings or equivalent), not simply “Protestant and Baptist.”
   - **Fix:** Implement the same religious tradition classification as in Bryson (1996). If RELTRAD wasn’t available, replicate her rule set from the paper/appendix (or from the survey’s denomination variable). Don’t substitute.

3. **Dependent variables (DV) construction**
   - **Generated DVs:** `dv1_minority6` (count of 6), `dv2_remaining12` (count of 12)
   - **True DVs:** same labels conceptually, but **Table 2 N’s imply different valid-data handling**.
   - **Mismatch:** Your DV construction/validity rules yield **much smaller N** than the table, which implies the generated DV coding or missing-data treatment differs from Bryson.
   - **Fix:** Reproduce Bryson’s exact “dislike” definition (e.g., “dislike” vs “strongly dislike,” treatment of “never heard,” DK, inapplicable), and her rule for requiring valid responses across genres (count computed with partial data vs listwise across items). Then ensure the sample matches the reported Ns.

### 2) Sample size (N) and model fit mismatches (major)

1. **Model 1 N**
   - **Generated:** N = **438**
   - **True:** N = **644**
   - **Mismatch:** -206 cases (massive). This alone guarantees coefficient differences.
   - **Fix:** Match Bryson’s inclusion rules:
     - same survey/sample frame
     - same age restrictions (if any)
     - same handling of missing on any IVs (likely **listwise deletion** on the regression variables, but your N suggests you may be dropping far more—possibly by requiring complete data on all 18 genre items, or by recoding that creates extra missingness)
     - same weights (see below)

2. **Model 2 N**
   - **Generated:** N = **406**
   - **True:** N = **605**
   - **Mismatch:** -199 cases.
   - **Fix:** Same as above.

3. **R² / Adjusted R²**
   - **Generated:** Model1 R² **0.125**, Adj R² **0.100**; Model2 R² **0.129**, Adj R² **0.102**
   - **True:** Model1 R² **0.145**, Adj R² **0.129**; Model2 R² **0.147**, Adj R² **0.130**
   - **Mismatch:** Both models’ R²/Adj R² are too low in generated output, consistent with wrong sample/variable construction and/or unweighted vs weighted estimation.
   - **Fix:** After fixing DV/IV coding and sample definition, verify whether Bryson used **survey weights**. If she did and you did not, both coefficients and R² can differ. Replicate the estimator (OLS but possibly weighted).

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (by variable)

Below I list **every coefficient** where generated ≠ true (i.e., all of them). “Generated” uses your `Std_Beta` values.

#### Model 1 (DV: minority-linked genres, 6)

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | 0.127** | 0.130** | Slightly off | Will likely align once N/coding/weights match. |
| Education | -0.205*** | -0.175*** | Too negative | Sample/coding mismatch; ensure education scale matches Bryson and standardization done the same way. |
| Household income per capita | +0.032 | -0.037 | **Sign flips** | Income construction differs (per-capita definition, inflation, log vs raw, top-coding) and/or wrong coding direction. Use Bryson’s exact income-per-capita computation and missing treatment. |
| Occupational prestige | +0.007 | -0.020 | Sign/size mismatch | Wrong prestige measure (different prestige scale) or coding. Use the same prestige index Bryson used. |
| Female | -0.075 | -0.057 | Too negative | Sample/coding differences (female dummy, coding of sex). Should converge with correct sample. |
| Age | 0.146** | 0.163*** | Too small + wrong significance | Your SE/p-values are not from Bryson; also N differs. With correct N, coefficient and stars should match. |
| Black | -0.155** | -0.132*** | Too negative + wrong significance | Race coding differs and/or sample differs; also your significance differs because your p-values differ. |
| Hispanic | +0.030 | -0.058 | **Sign flips** | Hispanic proxy/coding is wrong relative to Bryson. Must replicate true Hispanic variable. |
| Other race | 0.000 | -0.017 | Wrong magnitude/sign | Race categories likely differ (how “other” defined, multiracial handling). Use Bryson’s race coding scheme. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.100 | 0.063 | Too large | Proxy definition is wrong. Use Bryson’s classification. |
| No religion | 0.066 | 0.057 | Slightly off | Should improve after sample match. |
| Southern | -0.019 | 0.024 | **Sign flips** | Region coding differs (South definition, migration, census region vs “South” dummy) and/or sample differs. Use Bryson’s “Southern” definition. |
| Constant | 2.575*** | 2.415*** | Off | Intercept depends on DV coding and whether variables are centered/standardized in computation; also sample differs. Match DV/IV coding and estimation exactly. |

#### Model 2 (DV: remaining 12 genres)

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | -0.034 | 0.080 | **Sign flips** | This is a strong signal your DV construction and/or sample differs; also could be coding of racism scale reversed. Confirm racism scale direction matches Bryson and DV coding matches. |
| Education | -0.223*** | -0.242*** | Too small (less negative) | Education coding/standardization/sample mismatch. |
| Household income per capita | -0.030 | -0.065 | Too small | Income construction mismatch and sample/weights. |
| Occupational prestige | -0.032 | 0.005 | **Sign flips** | Wrong prestige measure/coding. |
| Female | -0.073 | -0.070 | Close | Likely fine once sample/weights fixed. |
| Age | 0.114* | 0.126** | Too small + wrong sig | Again, significance stars won’t match unless you replicate Bryson’s sample/estimation. |
| Black | 0.050 | 0.042 | Close | Should align after sample match. |
| Hispanic | -0.051 | -0.029 | Too negative | Hispanic proxy/coding mismatch. |
| Other race | 0.078 | 0.047 | Too large | Race coding mismatch. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.104 | 0.048 | Too large | Proxy definition mismatch. |
| No religion | 0.015 | 0.024 | Too small | Sample/weights mismatch. |
| Southern | 0.083 | 0.069 | Too large | South definition and/or sample/weights. |
| Constant | 5.534*** | 7.860 (no stars shown in your excerpt) | Very different | DV coding and sample mismatch; also you’re adding significance stars to an intercept that Bryson’s table does not present the same way here. |

---

### 4) Standard errors: reported vs not reported (interpretation mismatch)

- **Generated:** You present significance stars but **do not show standard errors**; however your prompt asks to check SEs too.
- **True Table 2:** **No standard errors are reported at all**.
- **Mismatch in interpretation/reporting:** Any SEs (or p-values derived from your model) are **not comparable** to Table 2 because Table 2 doesn’t provide them. Also, your significance stars are therefore not verifiable against the printed table unless your coding/sample match exactly (and even then, rounding/df choices matter).
- **Fix:** To “match the paper,” output **only standardized coefficients with Bryson’s stars**, and match the exact Ns and R². If you also want SEs, label them clearly as “computed from replication model; not reported in Bryson (1996).”

---

### 5) Significance/star mismatches (interpretation)

Even where coefficient magnitudes are close, your **stars differ** (e.g., Age and Black in Model 1; Age in Model 2). This is expected because:

- Your **N is much smaller**, changing SEs/p-values.
- Your **variables are proxies** (Hispanic, Conservative Protestant).
- Your **DV coding/validity rules** likely differ.
- Potentially **weights** differ.

**Fix:** After you match the exact variable coding + sample + weights, then compute p-values/stars using the same rule (two-tailed, same df). Also apply Bryson’s rounding (Table values are typically rounded to 3 decimals).

---

### 6) One more key issue: “standardized OLS coefficients” vs what you actually standardized

- **True:** Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas). Intercepts are shown but betas are standardized.
- **Generated:** You label columns `Std_Beta` but also include an “intercept (unstandardized).”
- **Potential mismatch:** If you computed “standardized betas” by standardizing variables manually (z-scores) *and still included the intercept*, you’ll get an intercept near ~mean(DV) (often ≈ 0 if DV standardized). Your intercepts don’t reflect that, implying you did *not* fully standardize the DV (or you computed betas via a post-hoc formula). That’s okay, but it must match Bryson’s method.
- **Fix:** Compute standardized betas in a way consistent with Bryson:
  - run OLS on original scales
  - compute beta = \(b \times \frac{SD(X)}{SD(Y)}\)
  - keep intercept from the unstandardized regression (that’s consistent with showing a nonzero constant)

---

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1. **Use Bryson’s exact dataset/sample** (same survey wave, same respondents).
2. **Rebuild the two DVs exactly** (same 6 genres and same 12 genres; same “dislike” threshold; same missing-data handling across items).
3. **Recode IVs to match the paper** (not proxies):
   - Hispanic (true Hispanic indicator)
   - Conservative Protestant (true classification)
   - Income per capita (same definition and transformation)
   - Occupational prestige (same prestige scale/index)
   - Southern (same definition)
   - Racism scale direction (verify it matches)
4. **Match the estimation procedure**:
   - OLS
   - same weighting (if used)
   - same missing-data rule (likely listwise on regression vars, but not overly restrictive item-wise missingness)
5. **Report outputs in the same format**:
   - standardized coefficients (rounded like the table)
   - R², adjusted R², N exactly as printed
   - do not introduce SEs as if they were in Table 2; if you add them, label as replication-only.

If you paste the code (or describe your DV/IV construction rules and missing-data steps), I can point to the exact step(s) that are driving the big N drop and the sign flips (income, Hispanic, Southern, racism Model 2).
