Score: 13/100
============================================================

## 1) Variable-name and row-alignment mismatches (major)

### A. Your generated tables have **no variable labels**
- **Problem:** The “paper style” and “full” tables list coefficients by row only, so it’s impossible to verify which coefficient corresponds to which Table 2 variable. This is a *critical discrepancy* because any row-order mismatch will silently produce wrong comparisons and interpretations.
- **Fix:** Output results with an explicit `term` column (e.g., `Racism score`, `Education`, etc.) and enforce a deterministic ordering that matches Bryson’s Table 2.

### B. You dropped **“No religion”** due to “zero variance”
- **Generated fit section:** `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: no_religion` in both models.
- **True table:** “No religion” is included and has coefficients **0.057** (Model 1) and **0.024** (Model 2).
- **Implication:** Your estimates for other religion-region variables (esp. Conservative Protestant, Southern) can shift because the model specification differs.
- **Fix:**  
  1) Verify the coding of `no_religion` (likely mis-coded to all 0/1, or merged incorrectly).  
  2) Ensure missing values aren’t being recoded into a single category that collapses variance.  
  3) If you are subsetting to music-genre respondents, confirm `no_religion` isn’t accidentally filtered to one value.

### C. You appear to have **11 predictors used** but Table 2 has **12 predictors + constant**
- **True predictors (12):** Racism, Education, Income pc, Prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern.
- **Generated:** requested 12, used 11, plus constant; also shows a NaN row (see below).
- **Fix:** Make sure the design matrix includes all 12 predictors (and does not omit a factor level unintentionally). Print `model.matrix()` (R) / `X.columns` (Python) to verify.

### D. There are **mysterious NaN rows** (blank coefficient rows)
- **Generated tables:** there is a row of `NaN` in both ModelA and ModelB tables.
- **Problem:** This usually indicates a term that failed estimation, a placeholder row (e.g., for a reference category), or a formatting bug that inserted an empty row.
- **Fix:** Remove placeholder rows and instead:
  - If you have categorical predictors, report only estimated (non-reference) levels with clear labels.
  - Validate that no column is entirely missing/constant after listwise deletion.

## 2) Sample size and fit-statistic mismatches (fatal to “matching the paper”)

### A. **N is wrong**
- **Generated:** ModelA n=203; ModelB n=197  
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605
- **Fix:** Use the same dataset/wave and inclusion criteria as Bryson (GSS 1993) and the same construction of the DV(s). Your current pipeline is using a much smaller analytic sample (likely due to:
  - using a different year,
  - using only respondents with complete data on many items,
  - building the DV from a different set of genre items,
  - or accidentally subsetting to a narrow population).
  - Bryson’s DV is **count of genres disliked** for two specific sets; replicate that exactly.

### B. **R² / Adjusted R² do not match**
- **Generated:**  
  - ModelA R²=0.165; adj R²=0.117  
  - ModelB R²=0.194; adj R²=0.146  
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R²=.145; adj R²=.129  
  - Model 2 R²=.147; adj R²=.130
- **Fix:** Once N and predictors match, re-check:
  - DV construction (counts of disliked genres as Bryson defines),
  - standardization method (see below),
  - weighting (GSS often uses weights; Bryson may have used them—if the paper did and you didn’t, fit will differ).

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (direction/magnitude/significance)

Because your generated output is unlabeled, I can only compare *likely* matches by pattern, but there are still clear contradictions with the true table.

### Model 1 (true) vs Generated ModelA (standardized “beta_std”)
True Model 1 standardized coefficients (key ones):
- Racism **0.130** **(positive, sig **)**
- Education **-0.175*** 
- Income pc **-0.037**
- Prestige **-0.020**
- Female **-0.057**
- Age **0.163*** (positive, strongly sig)
- Black **-0.132*** (negative, strongly sig)
- Hispanic **-0.058**
- Other race **-0.017**
- Cons Prot **0.063** (ns)
- No religion **0.057** (ns)
- Southern **0.024** (ns)
- Constant **2.415***  

Generated ModelA has (in row order shown):  
0.138, -0.253**, 0.024, 0.005, -0.037, 0.150*, -0.192, 0.063, -0.009, 0.073, NaN, -0.023, constant 2.823***

**Mismatches that are evident even without labels:**
- **Education magnitude too large:** -0.253** vs true -0.175*** (and wrong sig level).
- **Age significance too weak:** generated has ~0.150* whereas true Age is 0.163***.
- **Black coefficient too negative and not significant:** generated -0.192 (no stars) vs true -0.132***.
- **Constant too large:** 2.823*** vs 2.415***.
- **No religion missing entirely** (dropped), but should be 0.057.

**Fixes:**
1) Correct sample and DV; these shifts (Age/Black/Constant) often indicate different coding or different outcome definition.  
2) Ensure standardized betas replicate Bryson’s method (see Section 5).  
3) Include `no_religion` properly.  
4) Apply the same controls and reference categories.

### Model 2 (true) vs Generated ModelB (standardized “beta_std”)
True Model 2 highlights:
- Racism **0.080** (positive, ns)
- Education **-0.242*** (strong)
- Income pc **-0.065** (ns)
- Prestige **0.005** (ns, positive)
- Female **-0.070**
- Age **0.126** **(positive, sig **)**
- Black **0.042** (positive, ns)
- Hispanic **-0.029**
- Other race **0.047**
- Cons Prot **0.048**
- No religion **0.024**
- Southern **0.069**
- Constant **7.860** (no stars reported in the paper table)

Generated ModelB (row order shown):  
-0.013, -0.260**, -0.068, -0.098, -0.093, -0.006, 0.012, 0.071, 0.154*, 0.114, NaN, 0.186**, constant 7.077***

**Clear mismatches:**
- **Racism sign likely wrong:** generated first coefficient is **negative (-0.013)** but true racism is **positive (0.080)**.
- **Age appears wrong sign/placement:** true Age is +0.126**; in your list, the only clearly positive moderate one is 0.071 (too small, ns) and 0.154* (too large and only *).
- **Prestige should be +0.005 (≈0)** but you have a large negative around -0.098 or -0.093 if that row corresponds to prestige.
- **Constant is off:** 7.077 vs 7.860 (and you mark it *** though Bryson’s table shows no stars for the constant in Model 2).
- Again **No religion missing** (dropped).

**Fixes:**
- Rebuild the model with correct variable mapping and ensure the “racism score” variable is actually what Bryson uses (and coded in the same direction).
- Ensure your “ModelB” DV is truly “12 remaining genres” and not a different subset.
- Fix standardization and weighting; both can change magnitude and significance.

## 4) Standard errors: your output invents something the paper doesn’t provide

### Discrepancy
- **True:** Bryson Table 2 reports *standardized coefficients + significance markers only*; **no SEs are reported**.
- **Generated:** you report `std_err`, `t`, `p_value` for each coefficient.

### Why this is a mismatch
Even if your regression is correct, you cannot “match” SEs to Table 2 because the target table has none. Also, your significance stars are then based on your computed p-values, which may not align with the paper if:
- sample differs,
- weighting differs,
- or Bryson used different variance estimation.

### Fix options
- If the goal is to match the paper table: **remove SE/t/p columns** and report only standardized betas and Bryson-style stars (but then you must match his model/sample).
- If the goal is to extend the analysis: keep SEs, but explicitly state: “SEs not available in the paper; these are from our replication using [method].”

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)

Examples where stars diverge from the true table (even ignoring labels):
- **Model 1 Age:** true ***; generated only *.
- **Model 1 Black:** true ***; generated none.
- **Model 2 Education:** true ***; generated **.
- **Model 2 Age:** true **; generated pattern doesn’t clearly show a +0.126** anywhere.

**Fix:** Stars will not match until:
1) N matches (644/605),
2) predictors match (including no religion),
3) DV construction matches Bryson’s genre groupings,
4) any survey weights / design effects match,
5) standardization method matches.

## 6) What to change so the generated analysis matches Bryson Table 2

Checklist that will usually resolve all mismatches:

1) **Use the correct data**: GSS 1993 (not pooled years unless the paper did).  
2) **Construct the DVs exactly**: counts of disliked genres for:
   - Model 1: Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin
   - Model 2: the “12 remaining” genres (verify the exact list in Bryson’s measurement section)
3) **Replicate coding of predictors**:
   - Racism score: same items, same direction, same scaling
   - Race dummies: Black, Hispanic, Other (reference = White)
   - Religion: Conservative Protestant and No religion dummies (with correct reference)
   - Southern dummy: same definition
4) **Do not drop `no_religion`**: fix coding so it varies in the analytic sample.
5) **Apply the same missing-data rule** as Bryson (likely listwise deletion, but confirm).
6) **Match weighting/design** (if used): apply GSS weight variable and decide whether to use robust SEs; at minimum, weighting affects coefficients in many cases.
7) **Standardization**: Bryson reports standardized OLS coefficients (betas). Ensure you compute betas in the same way:
   - either regress on standardized X and standardized Y,
   - or compute beta = b_unstd * (sd(X)/sd(Y)) using the same SDs from the estimation sample (and with weights if weighted).
8) **Report format**: Provide a table with exact variable names from Bryson and only the standardized coefficients + stars.

If you paste your variable list (with labels) for each row in ModelA/ModelB and how you built both dependent variables, I can map row-by-row exactly which generated coefficient is supposed to correspond to which true coefficient and pinpoint the precise mis-orderings in addition to the specification/sample problems above.
