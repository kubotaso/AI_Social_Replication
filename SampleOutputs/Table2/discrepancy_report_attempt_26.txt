Score: 24/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / coding mismatches

**1.1 Racism score label vs. true table**
- **Generated:** “Racism score (0–5; strict sum of 5 items)”
- **True:** “Racism score”
- **Mismatch:** The generated label asserts a *specific construction* (“strict sum of 5 items”, 0–5) that may or may not match Bryson’s exact index construction in Table 2. Even if it’s correct, it’s not how the table names it.
- **Fix:** Use the same variable naming as the table (“Racism score”) unless you can verify the index construction matches the paper exactly; if you keep the construction detail, put it in a footnote, not the variable name.

**1.2 Conservative Protestant definition**
- **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy: Protestant & Baptist)”
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant”
- **Mismatch:** Your generated model uses a proxy definition that almost certainly does **not** reproduce Bryson’s classification (fundamentalist/conservative Protestant traditions are typically defined with denomination/fundamentalism measures, not “Protestant & Baptist”).
- **Fix:** Recreate Bryson’s “Conservative Protestant” exactly per the paper’s coding rules. If the original uses denominational family or FUND measure, replicate that; don’t substitute “Baptist” unless that’s what Bryson did.

**1.3 Hispanic construction**
- **Generated:** “Hispanic (derived from ETHNIC codes 1–4 when available)”
- **True:** “Hispanic”
- **Mismatch risk:** This indicates ad hoc derivation (“when available”) that could differ from Bryson’s GSS-based Hispanic indicator. Also your generated coefficient sign differs (see below), suggesting coding mismatch (0/1 reversed, different source variable, or sample restrictions).
- **Fix:** Use the exact Hispanic indicator used in the GSS year(s) and as described in Bryson. Ensure coding is 1=Hispanic, 0=not; confirm missing-handling.

**1.4 “No religion” dropped / NaN**
- **Generated:** “No religion” appears as **NaN** and the model fit says `Dropped_no_variation: no_religion`.
- **True:** “No religion” has nonzero coefficients in both models (0.057 in M1, 0.024 in M2).
- **Mismatch:** In your analytic sample, “no religion” is constant (or becomes constant after listwise deletion), which is not true for Bryson’s samples.
- **Fix:** This is a *sample construction/listwise deletion* problem (see section 3). Rebuild the analytic sample to match Bryson’s N, and/or correct the religion variable coding so it varies. Also check if you accidentally subset to a group where “no religion” is absent.

### 2) Coefficient and significance mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I compare **Generated Std_Beta** to **True coefficient** (standardized OLS beta from Table 2). Any sign, magnitude, or star mismatch is a discrepancy.

#### Model 1 (DV: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”)

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | 0.144* | 0.130** | Stars wrong (** vs *); slightly different magnitude | Match sample + weights + exact racism index + exact DV construction; ensure same SE/p-value method if you are re-testing |
| Education | -0.260*** | -0.175*** | Magnitude too large | Sample mismatch (N 261 vs 644), missingness, weighting, and/or education coding differences |
| Income pc | -0.013 | -0.037 | Too small | Same: sample/weights/income construction differences |
| Occ prestige | 0.057 | -0.020 | **Sign reversed** | Prestige variable mismatch (different prestige scale) or coding error; confirm you used the same occupational prestige measure (e.g., Duncan SEI vs NORC prestige) and same coding for “in labor force”/missing |
| Female | -0.036 | -0.057 | Magnitude off | Sample/weights and/or sex coding |
| Age | 0.174** | 0.163*** | Stars wrong (*** vs **); magnitude close | p-values differ because your N is much smaller and/or you’re not using same weighting/design assumptions |
| Black | -0.207 | -0.132*** | Stars wrong (should be significant); magnitude too large | Race coding likely ok but sample/weights and listwise deletion distort effect and SE |
| Hispanic | 0.040 | -0.058 | **Sign reversed** | Hispanic coding reversed, or you derived Hispanic differently than Bryson, or sample composition differs due to missingness rules |
| Other race | -0.005 | -0.017 | Close (minor) | Sample/weights |
| Cons Protestant | 0.117 | 0.063 | Too large | Your proxy definition likely inflates effect; fix measure |
| No religion | NaN | 0.057 | Variable dropped | Fix sample + coding so it varies |
| Southern | -0.059 | 0.024 | **Sign reversed** | South coding mismatch (region variable, coding reversed), or sample/weights differences |

#### Model 2 (DV: “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”)

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | -0.009 | 0.080 | **Sign reversed and near zero** | Racism index mismatch and/or DV mismatch and/or sample mismatch; also possible you accidentally residualized/standardized differently |
| Education | -0.165* | -0.242*** | Too small and under-significant | Sample mismatch, weights, and/or education coding |
| Income pc | -0.079 | -0.065 | Close | Main problem is elsewhere |
| Occ prestige | -0.083 | 0.005 | **Sign reversed** | Prestige variable mismatch/coding issue |
| Female | -0.084 | -0.070 | Close | Mostly sample/weights |
| Age | 0.125 | 0.126** | Stars missing | p-values differ due to N/weights |
| Black | 0.025 | 0.042 | Close | Sample/weights |
| Hispanic | 0.018 | -0.029 | **Sign reversed** | Hispanic coding/definition mismatch |
| Other race | 0.124* | 0.047 | Too large and over-significant | Sample composition and/or misclassification in race categories |
| Cons Protestant | 0.141* | 0.048 | Too large and over-significant | Proxy definition mismatch |
| No religion | NaN | 0.024 | Dropped | Fix sample + coding |
| Southern | 0.101 | 0.069 | Somewhat larger | Sample/weights |

### 3) Model fit / N / constants: major mismatches

**3.1 Sample size (N)**
- **Generated:** N=261 (Model 1), N=259 (Model 2)
- **True:** N=644 (Model 1), N=605 (Model 2)
- **Mismatch:** This is the single biggest driver of coefficient and significance differences. Your “missingness_1993” table shows huge missingness on racism_score (~48%) and cons_prot (~36%), and you used **listwise deletion**, collapsing N drastically.
- **Fix:** Reproduce Bryson’s *actual analytic sample*:
  - Confirm the year(s): Table 2 is not necessarily “1993 only” in the way you implemented (your output repeatedly labels “1993”). If Bryson pooled years or used a different year, your restriction is wrong.
  - Use the same handling of missing data as Bryson. If Bryson used a larger sample, they either (a) had far less missingness on the racism battery than your extraction, (b) used different items/years, or (c) used different missing rules (e.g., mean imputation for the scale or allowing partial completion rather than “strict sum of 5 items”).
  - Don’t “strict-sum” requiring all 5 items if Bryson allowed partial responses (very plausible). That alone can halve the sample.

**3.2 R² and adjusted R²**
- **Generated:** R²=0.178 (M1), 0.151 (M2)
- **True:** R²=0.145 (M1), 0.147 (M2)
- **Mismatch:** Different sample, different variable constructions, and/or different weighting explain this.
- **Fix:** Once N and variable definitions match, R² should move toward the published values.

**3.3 Constant/intercept**
- **Generated constants:** 2.599 (M1), 5.198 (M2)
- **True constants:** 2.415 (M1), 7.860 (M2; no stars shown in the excerpt)
- **Mismatch:** Intercepts depend heavily on DV coding, sample, and whether predictors are centered/standardized before estimating. Table 2 reports standardized betas, but the **constant is from the unstandardized regression** (as typically reported). Your DV construction for Model 2 especially looks off given the constant gap (5.2 vs 7.86).
- **Fix:** Ensure:
  - You run OLS on the original (unstandardized) variables and compute standardized betas post hoc (or use software that outputs standardized betas but leaves intercept in original units).
  - The DV counts match Bryson’s exact item set and coding (see 4.1).

---

### 4) Interpretation/reporting mismatches

**4.1 DV construction likely mismatched**
- **Generated DV wording:** “0–6 dislike count” and “0–12 dislike count,” with “12 remaining genres.”
- **True DV wording:** same concept, but your descriptive stats and constants suggest your genre list/coding may not match exactly (especially Model 2 constant and mean).
- **Fix:** Verify:
  - Exact list of the 6 “minority-liked” genres in Bryson and exact 12 remaining genres in that survey year.
  - Definition of “dislike” (e.g., “dislike” vs “strongly dislike,” treatment of “neutral,” “never heard,” etc.). If you counted “never heard” as dislike (or excluded it) incorrectly, betas and intercept shift.

**4.2 Significance stars not matching**
- **Generated:** stars computed from your regression p-values (implied).
- **True:** stars as printed in Table 2.
- **Mismatch:** With different N, weights, and potentially different SE assumptions, stars will differ even if coefficients are close.
- **Fix:** To match Table 2 stars, you must match Bryson’s:
  - sample (N),
  - weights (if any),
  - model specification,
  - and their p-value computation (likely conventional OLS).
  If you can’t replicate those, you should not claim star-level agreement; report your p-values separately and note differences.

**4.3 Standard errors**
- **Generated:** you do **not** report SEs (only betas + stars).
- **True:** Table 2 also does **not** report SEs.
- **So:** No SE mismatch to flag. The mismatch is instead that you *implicitly* rely on SEs for stars, but you haven’t shown them—making auditing harder.
- **Fix:** If the goal is verification, add p-values/t-stats (even if the paper omitted them) so we can diagnose why stars differ.

### 5) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996) Table 2

1. **Use the correct dataset/year(s)** used for Table 2 (do not assume “1993” unless the paper explicitly says so).
2. **Rebuild the DVs** to match the paper:
   - identical genre set,
   - identical “dislike” threshold/coding,
   - identical handling of “don’t know/never heard.”
3. **Rebuild key predictors to match the paper:**
   - Racism scale: same items, same scoring, and crucially same missing rule (avoid “strict sum” if Bryson didn’t require complete data).
   - Conservative Protestant: use Bryson’s actual classification, not “Protestant & Baptist.”
   - Region (Southern): confirm coding (South vs non-South) and source variable.
   - Prestige: use the same prestige index and the same inclusion rules for nonworkers.
4. **Match missing-data handling** to recover N≈644 and N≈605:
   - If Bryson used partial scale scoring or imputation for racism items, replicate it.
   - Avoid listwise deletion if that is not what Bryson did (or at minimum, confirm it is).
5. **Match estimation details:**
   - OLS with the same weight (if any).
   - Compute standardized betas in the same way (standardize X and Y or use post-estimation beta formula).
6. **Then re-check** coefficients, R², adjusted R², constants, and significance marks.

If you share (a) the exact code you used to build the racism scale and the two DV counts, and (b) the survey year(s) and source variables for religion/region/prestige, I can pinpoint which construction choices are causing each sign flip (Hispanic, Southern, Prestige, and Model 2 Racism are the clearest red flags).
