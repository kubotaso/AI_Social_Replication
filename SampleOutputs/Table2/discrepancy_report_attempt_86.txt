Score: 0/100
============================================================

### 1) Table structure / variable-name mismatches (major)
**Problem:** Your generated `ModelA_table` and `ModelB_table` contain only a column of coefficients with sig stars, but **no variable names**, and they include a **`NaN` row**. Because Table 2’s coefficients are tied to specific covariates, the generated output is not auditable and cannot be matched reliably to the paper.

**How to fix:**
- Output a table with an explicit `variable` column in the exact order used in the paper:
  1. racism_score  
  2. education  
  3. hh_income_pc  
  4. occ_prestige  
  5. female  
  6. age  
  7. black  
  8. hispanic  
  9. other_race  
  10. cons_protestant  
  11. no_religion  
  12. southern  
  (and constant separately)
- Remove the `NaN` coefficient row: it indicates a failed computation (often from a perfectly collinear/missing variable, a parsing bug, or accidentally including an empty row).
- Ensure each coefficient is labeled with the correct predictor name.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (Model 1 / your “ModelA”)
True Model 1 coefficients (standardized) vs. your generated `ModelA_table` values do not match (and signs often differ). Since your rows are unlabeled, below I compare by the *paper’s variable order* (the only defensible mapping).

| Variable | True (Table 2 Model 1) | Generated (ModelA row) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.113 | **Wrong size + missing sig** |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.237** | **Wrong size + wrong sig level** |
| Income pc | -0.037 | 0.022 | **Wrong sign** |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.020 | **Wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.065 | close-ish (but still not matching) |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.132 | **Too small + wrong sig** |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.177* | **Wrong size + wrong sig** |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.030 | **Wrong size** |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.029 | **Wrong size** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.063 | 0.111 | **Wrong size** |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN | **Computation failure** |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.045 | **Wrong sign** |

**Constant mismatch (ModelA_fit vs. true):**
- True constant: **2.415***  
- Generated constant_b: **2.921794**  
This is not a small difference.

**How to fix (Model 1):**
- Use the correct analytic sample (see Section 4): the paper’s **N=644**, your fit reports **n=181**.
- Make sure the DV is constructed exactly as the paper: count of **disliked** among the 6 specified genres, coded **0–6**.
- Run **OLS with standardized coefficients** (or compute standardized betas correctly from the unstandardized model).
- Apply the paper’s significance cutoffs (two-tailed) and compute p-values from the model (but note: the paper table does not show SEs).

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (Model 2 / your “ModelB”)
Again comparing in paper order:

| Variable | True (Table 2 Model 2) | Generated (ModelB row) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.001 | **Wrong sign/near zero** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.223* | **Wrong size + wrong sig** |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.073 | close-ish (still not matching) |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.092 | **Wrong sign, much larger** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.113 | **Wrong size** |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.015 | **Too small + missing sig** |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.100 | **Wrong size** |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | 0.001 | **Wrong sign** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.161* | **Way too large + wrong sig** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.048 | 0.140 | **Too large** |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN | **Computation failure** |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.147* | **Too large + wrong sig** |

**Constant mismatch (ModelB_fit vs. true):**
- True constant: **7.860**  
- Generated constant_b: **6.497292**  

**How to fix (Model 2):**
- Same core fixes: correct sample (**N=605**, not 178), correct DV construction (count of dislikes among the **other 12 genres**, **0–12**), and correct standardized-beta computation.
- The near-zero/negative racism coefficient suggests you’re either (a) using the wrong DV, (b) miscoding racism_score direction, or (c) filtering to a very different subset.

---

### 4) Sample size and missing-data handling mismatches (the biggest driver)
**Problem:** The paper’s models use **N=644** and **N=605**. Your model fits report **n=181** and **n=178**—an order-of-magnitude difference. Your diagnostics table shows large non-missing Ns for many variables (often >1500), but racism_score has **841** non-missing, cons_protestant **939**, etc. So the drop to ~180 likely comes from an overly strict filter, a join/merge error, or requiring complete cases on variables that shouldn’t be in the model.

**How to fix:**
- Recreate the paper’s inclusion rule: listwise deletion on **exactly** the variables in the model and the DV—nothing extra.
- Verify you are using **GSS 1993** only (the paper: “General Social Survey, 1993”).
- Check for accidental restrictions (e.g., keeping only respondents who answered *all music items* plus extra variables; or subsetting to a race group; or dropping cases due to a miscoded factor).
- Confirm `hispanic` is not causing massive loss: your diagnostics show `hispanic` non-missing **1044** while other core vars are ~1600. If you require non-missing `cons_protestant` (939) AND `racism_score` (841) AND `hispanic` (1044) AND all music items, you can easily crater N—but you should still not be at 181 unless additional constraints exist.

### 5) R² / Adjusted R² mismatches
- True Model 1: **R²=.145; adj R²=.129**  
  Generated ModelA_fit: **R²=0.157686; adj R²=0.102861** (adj R² far lower; inconsistent with paper)
- True Model 2: **R²=.147; adj R²=.130**  
  Generated ModelB_fit: **R²=0.179462; adj R²=0.125089** (R² higher; adj R² slightly lower)

**How to fix:**
- The wrong N alone will change R²/adj R² materially.
- Ensure the DV is counted identically (same set of genres, same dislike coding, same handling of “don’t know/refused/not asked”).
- Ensure you’re using OLS (not Poisson/negative binomial) and not adding/removing predictors.

---

### 6) Standard errors: interpretation and reporting mismatch
**Problem:** You asked to compare “standard errors,” but the **true table provides no SEs**. If your generated workflow is producing SEs (not shown here, but you requested them), they cannot be compared to Table 2.

**How to fix:**
- Do **not** claim SEs are “from Table 2.” If you compute SEs from the GSS microdata, label them as your own replication outputs.
- If the goal is to match the published table, compare only:
  - standardized coefficients
  - significance stars (based on p-values from your replication model)

---

### 7) Significance-star mismatches
Your stars do not match the paper even where coefficients are in the ballpark (e.g., education in Model 1; education in Model 2; age in both).

**How to fix:**
- Use the paper’s two-tailed thresholds: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.
- Compute p-values from the same model and same N (again: your current N makes stars incomparable).
- Ensure standardization is not altering inference incorrectly (in OLS, standardizing variables changes coefficient scale but not t-stats if done properly; bugs often arise when standardizing with missingness handled inconsistently across variables).

---

### 8) DV construction and labeling issues
Your DV labels resemble the paper, but the sample sizes and constants suggest the DVs may not be constructed the same way.

**How to fix:**
- Explicitly show how each DV is built:
  - Which exact genre items are included
  - Which response category counts as “dislike”
  - Whether neutral/indifferent is excluded or treated as not-dislike
  - How missing/“not asked” is handled (drop case vs. treat as 0 vs. impute)
- Confirm the counts are bounded exactly (0–6 and 0–12) and match the paper’s approach.

---

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match the paper
1. Restrict to **GSS 1993**.
2. Construct DVs exactly as in Bryson (1996): two counts (0–6 and 0–12) from the specified genre “dislike” items.
3. Include exactly the 12 predictors listed (plus constant); no extras.
4. Use listwise deletion on those variables; verify N ≈ **644** and **605**.
5. Run OLS; compute **standardized betas** correctly.
6. Apply the paper’s star cutoffs; don’t invent SE comparisons to Table 2.
7. Output a labeled coefficient table (variable names + betas + stars) with no `NaN` rows.

If you paste the code (or the variable mapping/order used to build `ModelA_table`/`ModelB_table`), I can pinpoint exactly what created the `NaN` row and why the sample collapsed to ~180.
