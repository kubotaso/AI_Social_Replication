Score: 40/100
============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of the **Generated Results** against the **True Results (Bryson 1996, Table 2)**, covering **variable names, coefficients, significance markers, missing variables, fit statistics, N, constants, and interpretation**—and exactly what to change so the generated output matches the table.

---

## 1) Model naming mismatch (Model2A/2B vs Bryson’s Model 1/Model 2)

### Mismatch
- Generated labels: **Model 2A** and **Model 2B**
- True table labels: **Model 1** (minority-linked genres, count of 6) and **Model 2** (remaining 12)

### Fix
- Rename:
  - `Model 2A (Minority-linked genres: 6)` → **Model 1**
  - `Model 2B (Remaining genres: 12)` → **Model 2**

This matters because otherwise readers will incorrectly think these are “Model 2” variants rather than the paper’s two models.

---

## 2) Variable set mismatch: “Hispanic” is missing in generated output

### Mismatch
True table includes **Hispanic** in both models:
- Model 1: Hispanic = **-0.058**
- Model 2: Hispanic = **-0.029**

Generated tables include only:
- Black, Other race (but **no Hispanic**)

### Fix
- Add a `hispanic` dummy to both regression specifications.
- Ensure the race reference category matches Bryson (implicitly White, non-Hispanic).
- Update the output tables to include a row labeled **Hispanic** with the correct standardized coefficients and (lack of) significance stars.

---

## 3) Variable naming mismatches (table labels must match exactly)

### Mismatches (labels)
Generated uses:
- **“Household income per capita”** (OK label-wise, but coefficient differs; see below)
- **“Occupational prestige”** (OK label-wise)
- **“Conservative Protestant”** (OK label-wise)
- **Age** (OK label-wise)

But for consistency with Bryson’s table, ensure:
- **Hispanic** is present (see #2)
- Race categories should be labeled exactly: **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race**

### Fix
- Add “Hispanic”
- Keep “Other race” (don’t rename it to something else like “Other”)
- Don’t introduce “Nonwhite” or other regroupings.

---

## 4) Coefficient mismatches: Model 1 (Bryson Model 1 vs generated Model2A)

True Model 1 coefficients (standardized):
- Racism score **0.130**\*\*
- Education **-0.175**\*\*\*
- Income per capita **-0.037** (ns)
- Occ prestige **-0.020** (ns)
- Female **-0.057** (ns)
- Age **0.163**\*\*\*
- Black **-0.132**\*\*\*
- Hispanic **-0.058** (ns)
- Other race **-0.017** (ns)
- Cons Prot **0.063** (ns)
- No religion **0.057** (ns)
- Southern **0.024** (ns)
- Constant **2.415**\*\*\*

Generated Model2A “Std_Beta”:
- Racism score **0.131833**\*\*  ✅ close (rounding), stars match
- Education **-0.180139**\*\*\* ❌ coefficient off (too negative)
- Income per capita **0.008961** ❌ **wrong sign** (should be -) and wrong magnitude
- Occ prestige **-0.019019** ✅ close
- Female **-0.071658** ❌ too negative (vs -0.057)
- Age **0.156851**\*\*\* ❌ too small (vs 0.163)
- Black **-0.141030**\*\* ❌ coefficient off and **stars wrong** (should be ***)
- Other race **0.010867** ❌ wrong sign (should be -0.017)
- Cons Prot **0.083766** ❌ too large (vs 0.063)
- No religion **0.068263** ❌ too large (vs 0.057)
- Southern **0.026711** ✅ close
- Constant **2.461148**\*\*\* ❌ too high (vs 2.415)

### Fixes (Model 1)
To match Bryson exactly, you must ensure the generated model replicates Bryson’s:

1. **Include Hispanic** (missing variable can shift other coefficients).
2. **Use the same sample definition and missing-data handling** as Bryson (see #7 on N).
3. **Use standardized coefficients computed the same way** (see #9).
4. **Use the same operationalization of income per capita** (sign flip suggests you are not using Bryson’s transformation/measure; see #8).

---

## 5) Coefficient mismatches: Model 2 (Bryson Model 2 vs generated Model2B)

True Model 2 coefficients:
- Racism score **0.080** (ns)
- Education **-0.242**\*\*\*
- Income per capita **-0.065** (ns)
- Occ prestige **0.005** (ns)
- Female **-0.070** (ns)
- Age **0.126**\*\*
- Black **0.042** (ns)
- Hispanic **-0.029** (ns)
- Other race **0.047** (ns)
- Cons Prot **0.048** (ns)
- No religion **0.024** (ns)
- Southern **0.069** (ns)
- Constant **7.860** (no stars shown in your excerpt; note Bryson prints it but table conventions vary)
- R² **0.147**, Adj R² **0.130**, N **605**

Generated Model2B “Std_Beta”:
- Racism score **-0.002233** ❌ wrong sign and far from 0.080
- Education **-0.194316**\*\*\* ❌ too small in magnitude (should be -0.242)
- Income per capita **-0.035654** ❌ too close to zero (should be -0.065)
- Occ prestige **-0.012431** ❌ wrong sign (should be +0.005)
- Female **-0.069205** ✅ essentially matches
- Age **0.119317**\*\* ✅ close
- Black **0.066914** ❌ too large (vs 0.042)
- Other race **0.076128** ❌ too large (vs 0.047)
- Cons Prot **0.101269**\* ❌ too large and **stars wrong** (should be 0.048 ns)
- No religion **0.018895** ✅ close to 0.024
- Southern **0.075385** ✅ close
- Constant **4.957739**\*\*\* ❌ totally inconsistent with 7.860 and star treatment

### Fixes (Model 2)
1. Add **Hispanic**.
2. Fix sample/N to match Bryson (see #7).
3. Fix standardization procedure (see #9).
4. Fix DV construction and scaling (constant discrepancy suggests DV mismatch and/or unstandardized modeling differences; see #6).

---

## 6) Dependent variable / intercept inconsistency (constants are a red flag)

### Mismatch
- True constants:
  - Model 1 constant: **2.415*** (matches DV range 0–6)
  - Model 2 constant: **7.860** (matches DV range 0–12)
- Generated constants:
  - Model2A: **2.461*** (close-ish but off)
  - Model2B: **4.958*** (**far too low** for a 0–12 count DV)

### What this implies
Your **Model2B DV is likely not the same measure** as Bryson’s “dislike of the 12 remaining genres (count of 12)”, or:
- you standardized DV internally but still reported an “unstandardized intercept,” or
- you used a different coding (e.g., reverse-coded dislike/like, different thresholds for “dislike”, missing genre items, or rescaled counts).

### Fix
- Recreate DV exactly as Bryson did:
  - **Count of disliked genres** out of the relevant set (6 or 12).
  - Ensure the “dislike” definition (e.g., rating categories counted as dislike) matches the paper.
  - Ensure you included all 12 “remaining” genres items that Bryson used.
- Fit the OLS on the **raw count DV** (not z-scored DV), then compute **standardized betas** for reporting (Bryson reports standardized betas but still prints a constant from the unstandardized equation).

---

## 7) Sample size (N) mismatch and downstream effects on coefficients

### Mismatch
True N:
- Model 1: **644**
- Model 2: **605**

Generated N:
- Model2A: **549** (short by 95)
- Model2B: **507** (short by 98)

This is not minor—different N will change coefficients and significance.

### Fix
- Apply the **same inclusion rules** as Bryson:
  - same survey year/wave,
  - same age restrictions (if any),
  - same handling of missing genre responses (did Bryson allow partial completion?),
  - same handling of missing predictors (listwise deletion vs imputation).
- Practically: audit missingness variable-by-variable and replicate the paper’s deletion strategy. If unknown, you need to locate Bryson’s appendix/methods or replication notes.

---

## 8) Income per capita sign error in Model 1

### Mismatch
- True Model 1 income per capita: **-0.037**
- Generated Model2A income per capita: **+0.008961**

A sign reversal strongly suggests you constructed income differently (e.g., raw household income rather than per capita, reversed coding, logged vs not, top-coding differences, or wrong denominator).

### Fix
- Recompute `income_pc` exactly:
  - household income / household size (or equivalent used by Bryson),
  - apply any transformations Bryson used (if logged, top-coded, etc.),
  - ensure higher values mean higher income.

---

## 9) “Standard errors” mismatch (and why you cannot match them)

### Mismatch
User requested checking standard errors, but:
- True results: **no standard errors reported**
- Generated: **also no SEs** (only stars)

### Fix
- Don’t invent or claim standard errors for “matching Bryson Table 2.”
- If you want SEs, you must compute them from the underlying data, but you **cannot validate them against Table 2**.

So: remove any narrative implying the paper reported SEs/t-stats.

---

## 10) Significance markers mismatch (stars)

### Model 1: Black
- True: Black **-0.132***  
- Generated: Black **-0.141** **(only **)**

### Model 2: Conservative Protestant
- True: **0.048** (ns)
- Generated: **0.101**\* (significant)

### Fix
Stars depend on:
- the **exact sample**, and
- the **exact model specification** (including Hispanic), and
- correct **standard errors** computation.

Once you replicate Bryson’s N/specification, your p-values (and stars) should align much more closely.

---

## 11) Fit statistics mismatch (R² and Adjusted R²)

### Mismatch
True:
- Model 1 R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**
- Model 2 R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**

Generated:
- Model2A R² = **0.133**, Adj R² = **0.115**
- Model2B R² = **0.120**, Adj R² = **0.100**

### Fix
Again: sample/specification/DV construction. R² discrepancies are consistent with:
- missing Hispanic,
- wrong DV definition,
- different missingness handling (N too low).

---

## 12) Interpretation mismatch: Racism in Model 2

### Mismatch
True Model 2: Racism score = **+0.080** (ns)
Generated Model2B: Racism score = **-0.002** (ns but near zero and wrong sign)

### Fix
After fixing:
- DV construction for “remaining 12”
- sample size
- inclusion of Hispanic
- standardization method

the racism coefficient should become positive and closer to 0.080.

---

# Summary of required corrections to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1. **Rename models** to Bryson’s Model 1 and Model 2.
2. **Add Hispanic** predictor in both models (currently missing).
3. **Rebuild both DVs** exactly as counts of disliked genres (6 and 12) using Bryson’s dislike definition and item set.
4. **Match Bryson’s analytic samples**: N must be **644** and **605**; replicate missing-data rules.
5. **Fix income per capita construction** (Model 1 sign is wrong).
6. **Compute standardized betas the same way Bryson did**, but report the intercept from the unstandardized model in the table (as Bryson does).
7. **Do not claim SEs** are being matched to Table 2, because the table doesn’t report them.

If you tell me (a) what dataset you used (e.g., GSS year), (b) which genre items you counted as “remaining 12,” and (c) how you coded “dislike,” I can point to the most likely source of the DV/intercept and N discrepancies much more precisely.
