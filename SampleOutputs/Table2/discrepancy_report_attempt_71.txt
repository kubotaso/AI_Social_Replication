Score: 10/100
============================================================

### 1) Table structure / reporting: SEs and t-stats are not recoverable from the “true” table
**Mismatch**
- Your **Generated Results** report `t`, `p_value`, and (implicitly) standard errors (since \(t=\beta/SE\)).
- The **True Results** (Bryson Table 2) **do not report SEs, t-stats, or p-values**—only standardized coefficients and significance stars.

**Fix**
- If you want to match Table 2, **remove SE/t/p columns entirely** and keep only:
  - standardized coefficient (`beta_std`)
  - significance stars (as shown in the paper)
- If you insist on SEs/t/p, you must compute them from the original GSS microdata and model specification; they **cannot** be validated against Table 2.

---

### 2) Sample size and fit statistics: N, R², adjusted R² do not match
#### Model 1 (paper) vs Generated ModelA_fit
**Mismatch**
- Generated ModelA_fit: **N=203, R²=0.16468, adj R²=0.1166**
- True Model 1: **N=644, R²=.145, adj R²=.129**

**Fix**
- Your analytic sample is wrong (likely due to:
  - using a different dataset/year than GSS 1993
  - listwise deletion on variables that shouldn’t be included / coded as missing
  - filtering to a subgroup
  - using the wrong dependent variable construction)
- To match:
  1) Use **GSS 1993** and reproduce Bryson’s inclusion/exclusion rules.
  2) Recreate the DV exactly (see Section 4).
  3) Ensure the same missing-data handling (Bryson likely uses listwise deletion but on the correct set of variables and correct coding).
  4) Ensure weights (if used) match the paper’s approach.

#### Model 2 (paper) vs Generated ModelB_fit
**Mismatch**
- Generated ModelB_fit: **N=197, R²=0.194, adj R²=0.146**
- True Model 2: **N=605, R²=.147, adj R²=.130**

**Fix**
- Same as above: your sample construction and/or DV construction is not the one used in the paper.

---

### 3) Variable list / row alignment: your tables have missing rows and likely wrong ordering
Both generated tables show **13 lines**, including **two rows with NaN** and a final row with `t` and `p` but **no coefficient** (looks like the intercept got separated/mangled).

**Mismatch**
- Paper models include **12 predictors + constant** (13 rows total).
- Your `k_predictors = 11` suggests you have **11 predictors** (plus intercept), meaning you are **missing one predictor** relative to the paper or you combined categories incorrectly.
- The NaN rows indicate a formatting/join/merge bug (e.g., variable names failed to merge with results, or intercept handled differently).

**Fix**
- Build a clean results dataframe keyed by an explicit variable-name column (not row position).
- Ensure you estimate exactly these predictors (paper’s names):
  1) Racism score  
  2) Education  
  3) Household income per capita  
  4) Occupational prestige  
  5) Female  
  6) Age  
  7) Black  
  8) Hispanic  
  9) Other race  
  10) Conservative Protestant  
  11) No religion  
  12) Southern  
  + Constant
- Ensure the reference group for race/religion is the same as Bryson’s (typically White; and some baseline religion category).

### 4) Coefficients: multiple sign and magnitude mismatches (your results do not reproduce Table 2)
Below I compare the **paper’s standardized coefficients** to your `coef_beta` (which appears to be treated as standardized, but your model clearly isn’t reproducing the table). Because you did not supply variable names for each row, I infer mapping by position according to the paper’s row order.

#### Model 1 (paper) vs Generated ModelA_table (by row order)

| Paper variable | True β_std | Generated (row) | Generated β | Mismatch? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | +0.130** | 1 | +0.1368 | Close in size, but **stars differ** (paper **; generated none) |
| Education | -0.175*** | 2 | -0.2531 | Too large in magnitude; stars differ (paper ***, generated **) |
| Income pc | -0.037 | 3 | +0.0236 | **Wrong sign** |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 4 | +0.0050 | Wrong sign (small) |
| Female | -0.057 | 5 | -0.0360 | Smaller magnitude |
| Age | +0.163*** | 6 | +0.1499* | Similar magnitude but **understarred** (*** vs *) |
| Black | -0.132*** | 7 | -0.1799 | More negative; **missing stars** |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | 8 | +0.0452 | **Wrong sign** |
| Other race | -0.017 | 9 | -0.0097 | Close |
| Cons. Protestant | +0.063 | 10 | +0.0743 | Close |
| No religion | +0.057 | 11 | NaN | **Missing estimate entirely** |
| Southern | +0.024 | 12 | -0.0233 | **Wrong sign** |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 13 | coefficient missing, only t/p shown | **Intercept broken** |

**Key takeaway:** even where magnitudes look “kind of close,” the pattern of sign reversals (income, Hispanic, Southern) plus missing rows means this is **not the same model/DV/sample** as the paper.

#### Model 2 (paper) vs Generated ModelB_table (by row order)

| Paper variable | True β_std | Generated (row) | Generated β | Mismatch? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | +0.080 | 1 | -0.0133 | **Wrong sign** |
| Education | -0.242*** | 2 | -0.2601** | Close magnitude; stars differ (*** vs **) |
| Income pc | -0.065 | 3 | -0.0675 | Close |
| Occ prestige | +0.005 | 4 | -0.0977 | **Very wrong** (sign and magnitude) |
| Female | -0.070 | 5 | -0.0928 | Somewhat close |
| Age | +0.126** | 6 | -0.0060 | **Wrong sign and near zero** |
| Black | +0.042 | 7 | +0.0122 | Smaller |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | 8 | +0.0708 | **Wrong sign** |
| Other race | +0.047 | 9 | +0.1541* | Much larger; stars differ (none vs *) |
| Cons. Protestant | +0.048 | 10 | +0.1141 | Larger; paper has no stars |
| No religion | +0.024 | 11 | NaN | **Missing estimate** |
| Southern | +0.069 | 12 | +0.1860** | Much larger; stars differ |
| Constant | 7.860 | 13 | coefficient missing, only t/p shown | **Intercept broken** |

**Key takeaway:** Model 2 is clearly not aligned (racism and age even flip sign; occupational prestige wildly off).

### 5) Significance coding: you’re using p-values from your (non-matching) model
**Mismatch**
- Stars in your generated tables are driven by your computed p-values.
- Paper stars reflect *their* model, *their* N, and likely *their* weighting/SE assumptions.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to reproduce the paper table: assign stars to match the paper exactly (based on Table 2), **not** from your current p-values.
- If the goal is a new analysis: then you must stop calling it “true results from Table 2” and present it as a replication attempt that differs (and explain why).

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatch: you present results as if directly comparable, but they are not
**Mismatch**
- Generated output implies you successfully estimated the same models and can compare t/p/SE.
- True table is standardized coefficients only, different N, different fit, and likely different DV construction.

**Fix**
- In the writeup, explicitly state:
  - whether coefficients are standardized or not (paper: standardized)
  - how DVs are constructed (counts of disliked genres in two bundles)
  - the final analytic N and why it differs if it does
- To match the paper, reproduce:
  1) the DV bundles exactly (6 “minority-associated” genres; 12 remaining)
  2) the racism score construction
  3) coding of religion and region
  4) correct year/sample and missing-data rules

## Concrete “make it match” checklist
1) **Rebuild DV1 and DV2** exactly as Bryson:
   - DV1: number of disliked among *Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin*
   - DV2: number of disliked among the other 12 genres
2) Use **GSS 1993** and reproduce the paper’s sample restrictions.
3) Ensure all predictors match the paper and are coded equivalently (esp. religion dummies and race dummies).
4) Estimate OLS and report **standardized betas** (either standardize variables pre-regression or compute beta-weights post hoc).
5) Report **N, R², adj R²** and confirm they match (.145/.129; .147/.130) and N (644; 605).
6) Output table with **exact row labels** and no NaN rows; keep constant as a coefficient (unstandardized constant is fine, but don’t drop its estimate).
7) Do **not** report SE/t/p unless you are using the microdata; they are not in Table 2.

If you paste the variable-name mapping for each row in your generated tables (or the code that produced them), I can pinpoint exactly which predictors are missing/miscoded and why the signs flip (income/Hispanic/Southern in Model 1; racism/age/occ prestige in Model 2).
