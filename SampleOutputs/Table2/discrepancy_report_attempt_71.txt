============================================================

## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### 1.1 Missing **Hispanic** dummy (both models)
- **True table includes:** `Hispanic` (Model 1 = -0.058; Model 2 = -0.029)
- **Generated output:** no Hispanic term anywhere.

**Fix**
- Create the Hispanic indicator exactly as in the paper and include it in both models.
  - If using GSS-style race/ethnicity coding: Hispanic is typically *ethnicity*, not *RACE==?*. So you likely need an ethnicity variable (e.g., `HISPANIC` or `HISP`), not derived from `RACE`.
- Re-run both regressions with `hispanic` included.

---

### 1.2 “Black (RACE==2)” coding/label mismatch vs paper’s “Black”
- **True:** “Black” is a dummy in the table (and the coefficient differs in significance across models).
- **Generated:** explicitly labeled `Black (RACE==2)`.

This is a **potential** mismatch because Bryson’s coding could be different than your `RACE==2` rule, and the sample includes Hispanics separately (so race/ethnicity classification matters).

**Fix**
- Match Bryson’s race/ethnicity construction:
  - Use **separate** dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other race with **White** omitted as the reference.
  - Ensure Hispanics are not accidentally counted as “White” or “Other race” depending on your dataset’s coding.
- Update labels to the paper’s variable names: `Black`, `Hispanic`, `Other race`.

---

### 1.3 “Conservative Protestant (RELIG==1 & DENOM==1; proxy)” likely not the same construct
- **True:** `Conservative Protestant` is a specific classification (Bryson likely used RELTRAD-style or a denomination family coding).
- **Generated:** a “proxy” definition (`RELIG==1 & DENOM==1`), which may not match the paper.

**Fix**
- Recreate **exact** Conservative Protestant classification used in Bryson (1996).
  - If the paper used a denomination-family scheme, implement that scheme (often “fundamentalist/conservative Protestant” is not a single denomination code).
- Only then compare coefficients.

---

### 1.4 “No religion” wrongly dropped / set to NaN
- **True:** `No religion` is included with nonzero coefficients (Model 1 = 0.057; Model 2 = 0.024).
- **Generated:** `No religion (RELIG==4)` is **NaN** and flagged as `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion`.

This is a direct mismatch: you dropped a variable the paper estimated.

**Fix**
- Diagnose why `no_religion` has no variance in your analytic sample:
  - You may have filtered the sample in a way that removes all `RELIG==4`.
  - Or you recoded `RELIG` incorrectly (e.g., mapping all to non-4).
- Confirm counts: `tab(no_religion)` after all filters and listwise deletion.
- Rebuild the analytic sample so `no_religion` varies, then re-estimate.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **exact** coefficient mismatches (Generated vs True). I’m comparing your **ModelA_Std_Beta** to True Model 1, and **ModelB_Std_Beta** to True Model 2.

### Model 1 (Minority-linked 6 genres): generated vs true
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.146 | 0.130 | too large |
| Education | -0.266 | -0.175 | too negative (much larger magnitude) |
| Income pc | -0.048 | -0.037 | slightly too negative |
| Occ prestige | 0.025 | -0.020 | **sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.027 | -0.057 | too small magnitude |
| Age | 0.210 | 0.163 | too large |
| Black | -0.133 | -0.132 | close, but **sig differs** (see §3) |
| Other race | 0.010 | -0.017 | sign differs |
| Conservative Prot | 0.071 | 0.063 | close |
| No religion | NaN | 0.057 | missing (see §1.4) |
| Southern | 0.017 | 0.024 | slightly smaller |
| Hispanic | missing | -0.058 | missing (see §1.1) |
| Constant | 2.657 | 2.415 | too high |
| R² | 0.205 | 0.145 | too high |
| N | 340 | 644 | **way off** |

**How to fix (substantive)**
- The huge N difference and missing Hispanic/no-religion are the biggest drivers. Your model is not being estimated on Bryson’s sample/spec.
- Also, you likely computed the DV differently (see §4) and/or used a restricted subsample.

### Model 2 (Remaining 12 genres): generated vs true
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.008 | 0.080 | far too small |
| Education | -0.205 | -0.242 | not negative enough |
| Income pc | -0.098 | -0.065 | too negative |
| Occ prestige | -0.026 | 0.005 | sign differs |
| Female | -0.079 | -0.070 | close-ish |
| Age | 0.132 | 0.126 | close-ish but sig differs (see §3) |
| Black | 0.092 | 0.042 | too large |
| Other race | 0.116 | 0.047 | too large |
| Conservative Prot | 0.097 | 0.048 | too large |
| No religion | NaN | 0.024 | missing |
| Southern | 0.121 | 0.069 | too large |
| Hispanic | missing | -0.029 | missing |
| Constant | 5.205 | 7.860 | too low |
| R² | 0.167 | 0.147 | slightly too high |
| N | 326 | 605 | **way off** |

**How to fix**
- Same core issue: your model/spec/sample do not reproduce Bryson’s.
- The near-zero racism beta in Model 2 strongly suggests your DV construction or standardization differs from the paper’s.

---

## 3) Significance/interpretation mismatches

### 3.1 Black significance in Model 1
- **True:** Black = **-0.132*** (p < .001)
- **Generated:** Black = -0.132 with only `*`

**Fix**
- Once the **sample size matches (N≈644)** and the **same model terms** are included, p-values should align much more closely.
- Also ensure you’re using the same handling of weights/design if Bryson did (many GSS analyses use weights; if you ignore weights, SEs/p-values can shift).

### 3.2 Age significance in Model 2
- **True:** Age = 0.126**  
- **Generated:** Age = 0.132 with only `*`

**Fix**
- Same: match N, specification, and (if applicable) weights.

### 3.3 Racism significance in Model 2 (interpretation error risk)
- **True:** Racism = 0.080 (not significant)
- **Generated:** Racism = 0.008 (also not significant), but the *coefficient itself* is wrong, which would lead to an incorrect substantive interpretation (“racism unrelated”) for the wrong reason.

**Fix**
- Correct DV and sample first; do not interpret until the coefficients match.

---

## 4) DV construction mismatch (very likely)

Your DVs are:
- `dv1_minority6_dislikes` (count of 6)
- `dv2_remaining12_dislikes` (count of 12)

Bryson’s DVs are phrased similarly, but the mismatched **constants** and **N** strongly suggest your DV isn’t constructed the same way (and/or you used different missing-data rules).

Common pitfalls:
- Using “dislike” thresholds differently (e.g., “dislike” = bottom-box vs below-midpoint).
- Treating “don’t know,” “not asked,” “never heard” as dislike or as missing.
- Using only respondents asked about all genres vs allowing partials.
- Using a different genre list or misassigning which 6 are “minority-linked.”

**Fix**
- Recreate the exact genre coding rules from Bryson (1996):
  - Exact list of genres in each DV.
  - Exact mapping from survey response scale to “dislike” indicator.
  - Exact missing-data handling (listwise deletion at model stage vs DV stage).
- Validate by checking DV distributions: means should be compatible with the reported constants (intercepts) and the maximum counts (0–6; 0–12).

---

## 5) Model fit / N mismatches (fatal discrepancy)

- **True N:** 644 (Model 1) and 605 (Model 2)
- **Generated N:** 340 and 326

That’s not a small deviation; it indicates a different analytic sample.

**Fix**
- Identify every filter you applied (age restrictions, music-item availability, nonmissing income/prestige, etc.).
- Replicate Bryson’s sample definition and missingness decisions:
  - Use the same survey year(s).
  - Same population restrictions (e.g., adults; possibly excluding Black/Hispanic oversamples depending on dataset).
  - Same listwise deletion variables: if Table 2 includes Hispanic and No religion, they must be part of the listwise deletion set.
- After rebuilding, verify N matches before comparing coefficients.

---

## 6) Standard errors: generated includes none (and shouldn’t invent them)

- **True:** Table 2 reports **no standard errors**.
- **Generated:** you didn’t show SEs in the displayed tables, but your instruction asks to compare SEs; none exist in True.

**Mismatch to fix**
- Do **not** claim “SE mismatches” against the paper because the paper doesn’t provide SEs.
- If you compute SEs anyway, present them as *your computed SEs*, but you cannot “match” them to the printed table.

**Fix**
- Restrict matching targets to: standardized betas, significance stars, R²/Adj R², N, constant.

## 7) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996) Table 2

1. **Rebuild predictors to match the paper**
   - Include: Racism, Education, Income pc, Prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern.
   - Ensure White is reference category.

2. **Fix the dropped “No religion”**
   - Confirm it varies; stop filtering it out inadvertently.

3. **Add Hispanic**
   - Use the correct ethnicity variable; don’t infer from RACE unless that’s how the dataset defines it (often it doesn’t).

4. **Recreate Conservative Protestant correctly**
   - Implement the same denomination-family rule as Bryson.

5. **Recreate DVs exactly**
   - Same genre lists, same “dislike” rule, same missing handling.

6. **Match the analytic sample (N)**
   - Aim for N=644 and N=605. Don’t proceed until you do.

7. **Use standardized OLS coefficients**
   - Confirm your “Std_Beta” is computed as standardized regression coefficients (either by standardizing X and Y prior to OLS or via post-hoc beta conversion).

8. **Only then compare**
   - Once N/spec/DVs match, coefficients, stars, and R² should line up closely.

If you share your codebook/coding rules for (a) the dislike indicators, (b) Hispanic, and (c) Conservative Protestant, I can point to the most probable exact source of the N collapse and the sign flips on prestige/other-race.
