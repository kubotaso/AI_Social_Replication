Score: 21/100
============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of **every mismatch** between the Generated Results and Bryson (1996) Table 2 “true” results, plus what you must change to make the generated output match the paper.

---

## 1) Model identification, DV definitions, and sample size (N): mismatches

### A. Sample size (N)
- **Generated**: Model A N = **340**; Model B N = **326**
- **True**: Model 1 N = **644**; Model 2 N = **605**
- **Fix**: You are not replicating Bryson’s analytic sample. To match the paper you must:
  1) Use the same survey year(s) and the same inclusion criteria as Bryson (GSS year(s), and any exclusions).  
  2) Use the same listwise deletion rules (or imputation rules if used—Bryson’s table implies a particular analytic N after exclusions).
  3) Ensure the dependent variables are computed for all respondents with the required music items, not a restricted subset.

### B. DV construction (very likely mismatch)
- **Generated DV ranges**:
  - DV1 max = **6**, DV2 max = **12** (counts of dislikes), which *sounds plausible*, but your **constants** and **means** don’t align with the paper’s constants and N.
- **True constants**:
  - Model 1 constant = **2.415***  
  - Model 2 constant = **7.860** (no stars shown in your excerpt; note also this is *much larger* than your generated constant 5.205)
- **Fix**: Recreate the DVs exactly as Bryson did (including coding of “dislike,” handling of “don’t know,” “not asked,” missing, and whether “neutral” counts as dislike). Small coding differences shift constants and N a lot.

---

## 2) Coefficients and significance stars: variable-by-variable mismatches

Important: Bryson reports **standardized OLS coefficients only** (betas), no SEs. Your generated tables are also “Std_Beta”, so comparison is direct.

### Model 1 (paper) vs Model A (generated)

| Variable | Generated Model A | True Model 1 | Mismatch? | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | **0.146** ** | **0.130** ** | Yes (coef) | Re-run with correct sample/DV; target beta ≈ 0.130 with ** |
| Education | **-0.266*** | **-0.175*** | Yes (coef too negative) | Correct sample/DV; also ensure education measure matches (years vs credentials) |
| Income pc | -0.048 | -0.037 | Yes (coef) | Correct construction/standardization and sample |
| Occ prestige | **+0.025** | **-0.020** | **Yes (sign flip)** | Likely prestige variable coding mismatch (e.g., wrong prestige scale, reversed, or different year’s prestige) |
| Female | -0.027 | -0.057 | Yes (coef) | Ensure coding is Female=1, Male=0 and matches sample |
| Age | **0.210*** | **0.163*** | Yes (coef) | Correct sample/DV; also confirm age is continuous years |
| Black | -0.133 * | **-0.132*** | **Yes (stars)** | Your coef matches closely, but significance is wrong. With correct N=644, it should be *** |
| Hispanic | **Dropped (unavailable)** | -0.058 | **Yes (missing variable)** | Include Hispanic variable from the data; do not drop |
| Other race | +0.010 | -0.017 | Yes (sign/coef) | Fix race coding: “Other race” must be defined the same way as Bryson (likely nonwhite, nonblack, nonhispanic) |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.071 | +0.063 | Yes (coef) | Use Bryson’s exact definition (not a “proxy”) |
| No religion | **Dropped (no variation)** | **+0.057** | **Yes (missing variable)** | Your “no variation” claim is an error; fix coding so it varies and is included |
| Southern | +0.017 | +0.024 | Yes (coef) | Ensure region coding matches Bryson’s “South” definition |

**Key interpretation mismatch (Model 1):**
- You implicitly treat missing Hispanic and no religion as “can’t estimate”; in the paper they are estimated. That is a substantive mismatch because it changes the model specification.

---

### Model 2 (paper) vs Model B (generated)

| Variable | Generated Model B | True Model 2 | Mismatch? | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | **0.008** | **0.080** | **Yes (large difference)** | DV and/or sample construction mismatch is severe here |
| Education | -0.205 ** | **-0.242*** | Yes (coef + stars) | With correct N and DV, should be more negative and *** |
| Income pc | -0.098 | -0.065 | Yes (coef) | Recompute income per capita exactly as Bryson |
| Occ prestige | -0.026 | **+0.005** | Yes (sign/coef) | Prestige measure/coding mismatch |
| Female | -0.079 | -0.070 | Slight mismatch | Likely resolves with correct sample |
| Age | 0.132 * | **0.126** ** | Yes (stars) | With correct N and DV, should be ** not * |
| Black | **+0.092** | +0.042 | Yes (coef) | Race coding/sample mismatch |
| Hispanic | Dropped (unavailable) | -0.029 | **Yes** | Must include Hispanic |
| Other race | **+0.116** * | +0.047 | Yes (coef + stars) | Race coding mismatch (too strong) |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.097 | +0.048 | Yes (coef) | Use Bryson’s definition, not proxy |
| No religion | Dropped (no variation) | +0.024 | **Yes** | Fix coding so it varies and include it |
| Southern | **+0.121** * | +0.069 | Yes (coef + stars) | Region coding mismatch or sample composition mismatch |

## 3) R² / Adjusted R²: mismatches

- **Generated**:
  - Model A R² = **0.205**, Adj R² = **0.181**
  - Model B R² = **0.167**, Adj R² = **0.141**
- **True**:
  - Model 1 R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**
  - Model 2 R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**

**Fix**: These won’t match until:
1) N matches (644/605),
2) you include the same covariates (Hispanic, No religion),
3) you use the same DV coding and same variable codings (prestige, region, conservative Protestant).

---

## 4) Constants: mismatches (and a conceptual issue)

- **Generated**:
  - Model A constant = **2.656***  
  - Model B constant = **5.205***  
- **True**:
  - Model 1 constant = **2.415***  
  - Model 2 constant = **7.860**  

**Two problems:**
1) **Numeric mismatch** (both models).
2) **Interpretation issue**: When reporting *standardized coefficients*, constants are often still unstandardized intercepts from the original DV scale, but they depend heavily on how predictors were entered (standardized or not) and how missingness/sample selection works.

**Fix**:
- Confirm whether you standardized predictors in-model or computed standardized betas post-estimation. To mirror Bryson, estimate OLS on raw variables and compute standardized betas in the same way the paper did (or use software option that reproduces it).
- Ensure the DV scales and coding match exactly.

---

## 5) Variable naming / definition mismatches

These are not just cosmetic—your definitions differ from the paper’s.

### A. Education label
- **Generated**: “Education (years)”
- **True**: “Education”
- **Potential mismatch**: Bryson likely used **years**, but you must confirm. If Bryson used categorical education recoded to years or vice versa, betas change.
- **Fix**: Use the exact education variable as in Bryson’s data prep.

### B. Conservative Protestant
- **Generated**: “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”
- **True**: “Conservative Protestant”
- **Mismatch**: Your own label admits it’s a proxy; that will not reproduce Bryson.
- **Fix**: Rebuild Conservative Protestant using Bryson’s classification scheme (likely FUND/EVANGELICAL coding or a denomination-based typology, not RELIG==1 & DENOM==1).

### C. Southern (REGION==3)
- **Generated**: explicitly REGION==3
- **True**: “Southern”
- **Mismatch risk**: GSS region codes can differ by year/recode; “South” might combine multiple categories.
- **Fix**: Verify the exact region mapping used by Bryson (and whether it includes “border states” etc.).

### D. Race categories
- **Generated**: Black, Other race, plus Hispanic dropped
- **True**: Black, Hispanic, Other race
- **Mismatch**: If Hispanic is treated as ethnicity separate from race, Bryson’s coding may allow “Black Hispanic” etc. Your dummy scheme may be different.
- **Fix**: Implement Bryson’s mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories exactly as in the paper:
  - Determine reference category (almost certainly White non-Hispanic),
  - Code Black, Hispanic, Other as in Bryson.

---

## 6) “Dropped (unavailable)” and “Dropped (no variation)” are errors relative to the true table

### Hispanic
- **Generated**: dropped (unavailable)
- **True**: included with coefficients in both models
- **Fix**: Retrieve/construct Hispanic variable in the dataset extract. If your extract truly lacks it, you cannot claim replication—get the complete data.

### No religion
- **Generated**: dropped (no variation)
- **True**: included (0.057 in Model 1; 0.024 in Model 2)
- **Fix**: Your construction `RELIG==4` is likely wrong for “no religion” or you filtered the sample such that RELIG==4 never occurs.
  - Check GSS RELIG coding for that year.
  - Ensure you didn’t inadvertently subset out nonreligious respondents.
  - Recode “no religion” to match Bryson (may combine “none” with other secular categories).

---

## 7) Interpretation/significance mismatches

Even when coefficients are close, your **significance stars** often don’t match the paper, because:
- You used a much smaller N (340/326 vs 644/605),
- You dropped predictors (Hispanic, no religion),
- Your variable definitions differ.

**Concrete examples:**
- **Black (Model 1)**: true is **-0.132*** but you show only `*`.
- **Age (Model 2)**: true is `0.126**` but you show `*`.
- **Racism (Model 2)**: true is 0.080 (no stars shown), but you estimate near zero.

**Fix**:
- After matching DV/sample/specification, compute p-values using the OLS model’s standard errors (even though Bryson doesn’t print SEs, significance comes from t-tests). Then assign stars using Bryson’s thresholds.

---

## 8) Missing standard errors: not a “mismatch,” but your comparison request includes SEs

- **Generated**: You do **not** report standard errors anywhere (only betas and stars).
- **True**: The paper **does not report SEs**.
- **So**: There is **no true SE to compare to**, and you should not invent “true SE” values.
- **Fix (presentation)**:
  - Either (a) remove any mention of SE comparison, or
  - (b) add SEs to your generated output but explicitly label them as “not reported in Bryson (1996); shown here for transparency,” and do *not* treat them as replication targets.

---

## What you need to change (minimal checklist to match Bryson)

1) **Match the analytic sample** to get N=644 and N=605.
2) **Reconstruct the two DVs exactly** as in Bryson (including missing handling).
3) **Use Bryson-consistent codings** for:
   - Hispanic,
   - No religion,
   - Conservative Protestant (not proxy),
   - Occupational prestige variable and year-specific prestige scale,
   - South/region,
   - Race/ethnicity mutually exclusive categories and reference group.
4) **Run OLS and compute standardized betas** in the same way as the paper.
5) **Apply the same significance thresholds** to the resulting p-values.

If you share your code/data dictionary (especially how you built the two DV indices and how you defined Conservative Protestant and race/ethnicity), I can pinpoint which single coding choice is driving each major coefficient deviation (e.g., the prestige sign flip and the near-zero racism effect in Model 2).
