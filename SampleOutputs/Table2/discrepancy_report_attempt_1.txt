Score: 23/100
============================================================

Below is a complete discrepancy audit between your **Generated Results** and the paper’s **True Results (Bryson 1996 Table 2)**, plus concrete fixes to make the generated analysis match what the table reports.

---

## 1) Fundamental reporting mismatch: standardized vs. unstandardized (and SEs shown vs. not shown)

### What the true table reports
- **Standardized OLS coefficients (betas)**.
- **No standard errors, t-stats, or p-values are printed** in Table 2 (only significance stars).

### What the generated output reports
- Coefficients labeled `beta` with accompanying `se`, `t`, `p`.
- The coefficients look like *standardized betas* (many are in ~[-.30, .30]), but the **constant is near 0**, which is typical of a regression on standardized DV—or of reporting a standardized intercept—whereas Table 2 reports **large unstandardized constants** (2.415 and 7.860).

### Why this is a mismatch
You are mixing two different reporting conventions:
- **Table 2:** standardized slopes + **unstandardized intercept** (as printed), and no SEs.
- **Generated:** standardized slopes + a **standardized intercept** (near 0) *and* SE/t/p.

### How to fix
Choose one target and align everything:

**If your goal is to replicate Table 2 exactly:**
1. Report **standardized slopes** (betas) *but keep the intercept unstandardized* (or at least match the table’s intercept).
2. Suppress SE/t/p in the table output (or compute them but do not present them as “matching Table 2”).

**Implementation options**
- If you use software that returns standardized betas (e.g., by z-scoring X and Y), then the intercept will be ~0. To match Table 2, you must:
  - Fit the model on the **original DV scale** (so the intercept matches), and compute standardized betas separately, e.g.  
    \[
    \beta_j^{std} = b_j \cdot \frac{s_{x_j}}{s_y}
    \]
  - Then display `beta_std` for slopes and display the original model’s intercept.

## 2) Model/DV definition mismatch (your DV names do not match the paper’s DVs)

### True DV definitions
- **Model 1 DV:** “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” (a specific 6-genre index).
- **Model 2 DV:** “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres” (a 12-genre index).

### Generated DV labels/descriptives
- `dv1_minority_dislike` / `model_dv1_minority_linked`
- `dv2_remaining_dislike` / `model_dv2_remaining`

Those labels are plausible, but your *descriptives strongly suggest the DV construction is not the same scale as the paper*:
- Generated `dv2_remaining_dislike` has max **12** (suggesting you may be summing binary dislikes across 12 genres).
- Generated `dv1_minority_dislike` has max **6** (same idea for 6 genres).

In Table 2, the constants (2.415 and 7.860) imply the DV is likely on a **count scale**, but the exact construction (and any weighting, missing-data handling, and coding of “dislike”) must match the author’s. Your N_used is also far smaller (see §4).

### How to fix
Replicate the DV construction exactly:
- Confirm how “dislike” is defined (e.g., bottom category only? bottom two? a reverse-coded liking scale?).
- Confirm whether the index is a **sum**, **mean**, or something else.
- Confirm missing-data rules: are indices computed if some genres are missing? Is there imputation? Listwise deletion?

Until DV construction and missingness handling match the paper, coefficients/R²/N will not line up.

## 3) Variable-name/content mismatches (Hispanic is missing and replaced; “No religion” sign mismatch)

### (A) “Hispanic” in the true table vs. absent in generated
**True models include:**
- `Hispanic` (separate from `Other race`)

**Generated includes:**
- `other_race`
- but **no `hispanic`**
  
So your race coding does not match Table 2.

#### Fix
Recreate Bryson’s race dummy specification:
- Include **both** `hispanic` and `other_race`, with the same omitted reference category as the paper (almost certainly White non-Hispanic).
- Keep `black` as a separate dummy as in the table.

### (B) “No religion” coefficient sign differs (Model 1 especially)
- **True Model 1:** `No religion = +0.057`
- **Generated Model 1:** `no_religion = -0.0218` (and oddly shares the same t/p as const—see §6)

This could indicate:
- The dummy is coded opposite (1 = has religion instead of none),
- The reference category differs,
- Or it’s not the same variable (e.g., “none” vs “other”),
- Or your model is mis-specified (collinearity / dropped category issues).

#### Fix
- Verify coding: `no_religion = 1` only if respondent reports none.
- Verify reference group for religion is the same as the paper (e.g., mainline Protestant/Catholic/etc.).
- Ensure you did not accidentally include both a full set of religious dummies plus intercept (dummy trap).

## 4) Massive mismatch in sample size and model fit statistics (N and R²)

### True
- Model 1: **N = 644**, **R² = 0.145**, **Adj R² = 0.129**
- Model 2: **N = 605**, **R² = 0.147**, **Adj R² = 0.130**

### Generated
- Model 1: **N_used = 340**, **R² = 0.205**, **Adj R² = 0.181**
- Model 2: **N_used = 326**, **R² = 0.167**, **Adj R² = 0.141**

Your N is roughly **half** the true N. That alone guarantees the results won’t match, and it likely changes coefficient magnitudes and significance.

#### Fix
- Reproduce the paper’s inclusion criteria:
  - Same survey/year/sample restrictions.
  - Same handling of missing data (likely **not** listwise deletion across all 10 predictors + all 18 genre items unless that’s what Bryson did).
- Check if you inadvertently restricted to a subgroup (e.g., only people with complete “minority linked” items).
- Ensure you used the same weights (if any). (The paper may use weighted analyses; if you ran unweighted, N may be similar but coefficients/R² can shift.)

## 5) Coefficient mismatches variable-by-variable (direction/magnitude)

Even ignoring N and DV construction, many slopes do not match closely. Here are the direct comparisons.

### Model 1 (minority-linked genres DV)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130 | 0.1396 | close-ish (but inference differs because N differs) |
| Education | -0.175 | -0.2661 | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.037 | -0.0478 | close-ish |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.0239 | **sign flip** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.0258 | attenuated |
| Age | 0.163 | 0.2189 | too large |
| Black | -0.132 | -0.1151 | close-ish |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | (missing) | **omitted** |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.0113 | **sign flip** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.063 | 0.0705 | close-ish |
| No religion | 0.057 | -0.0218 | **sign flip** |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.0155 | close-ish |
| Constant | 2.415 | 0.0688 | **wrong scale/standardization** |

### Model 2 (remaining genres DV)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | 0.0076 | far smaller |
| Education | -0.242 | -0.1996 | not too far but still off |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.0971 | more negative |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.0238 | sign flip (small though) |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.0733 | close |
| Age | 0.126 | 0.1292 | close |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.0849 | about 2× |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | (missing) | omitted |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.1215 | too large |
| Cons Protestant | 0.048 | 0.0944 | too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | -0.0015 | near zero and wrong sign |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.1101 | too large |
| Constant | 7.860 | 0.0046 | wrong scale/standardization |

#### Fixes (to address coefficient mismatches)
These mismatches are exactly what you’d expect from:
1. Wrong sample (your N is ~half).
2. Wrong DV construction or scaling.
3. Missing `hispanic` (race composition effects get absorbed into other coefficients).
4. Possibly different coding of occupational prestige, no religion, or the DV itself.

Once you correct (1)–(3), many coefficients should move toward the table.

## 6) Internal inconsistencies/bugs in the generated regression output (not just “doesn’t match the paper”)

There are red flags that your generated `betas_long` table may be **wrongly assembled**:

### (A) `no_religion` shares identical t and p with `const` in both models
- Model 1: const t=1.552532 p=0.121496 and no_religion t= -1.552532 p=0.121496 (same magnitude, same p)
- Model 2: const t=0.102924 p=0.918089 and no_religion t= -0.102924 p=0.918089

That is extremely unlikely to happen naturally and suggests a join/assignment bug (e.g., you copied the intercept’s stats into the no_religion row, or you computed t/p from the wrong columns).

#### Fix
- Recompute t and p **row-wise**: `t = coef / se`.
- Ensure `se` is the correct standard error for that coefficient from the model covariance matrix.
- When reshaping to long format, ensure the mapping from coefficient names to SE/t/p is aligned (same ordering and keys).

### (B) `black` in Model 2 has the exact same SE as `age` (0.054440)
Not impossible, but suspicious given multiple other issues.

#### Fix
Same as above: verify coefficient-to-SE alignment after reshaping/merging.

## 7) Degrees of freedom/model size inconsistencies

Generated fit shows `DF_model = 10` for both models, but your coefficient table includes:
- const + 11 predictors (racism_score, educ, income_pc, prestg80, female, age, black, other_race, cons_prot, no_religion, southern) = **12 parameters**, implying **11 predictors** → DF_model should be 11 (if intercept counted separately, many packages report DF_model = number of predictors excluding intercept).

But you also appear to be missing `hispanic` compared to the true model, which would change DF_model too.

#### Fix
- Confirm how `DF_model` is computed by your library.
- Ensure the number of predictors in the fit object equals what you print in `betas_long`.
- Add `hispanic` dummy so your predictor set matches the paper (and DF_model should reflect that).

---

## 8) Interpretation mismatch (significance and “stars”)

Your generated results provide p-values and would lead to interpretations like:
- Racism significant in model 1 but not model 2 (generated p=0.887), whereas the paper shows racism is 0.080 (not starred) in model 2—so qualitatively similar there—but many others differ.
- Education and age are significant in both in generated, which is broadly consistent, but magnitudes differ.

However, because Table 2 uses standardized betas + stars (and possibly a different N/weighting), you should not interpret your p-values as “matching Table 2”.

#### Fix
- After you truly replicate N/DVs/predictors/weights, then:
  - either compute stars using your p-values and show them,
  - or just report betas and compare to Table 2 without claiming exact significance replication unless your p-values align.

# Checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Rebuild both DVs** exactly as Bryson defines them (same genres, same dislike coding, same aggregation, same missing-data rule).
2. **Use the correct sample** so N matches (~644 and ~605). Identify why your N collapses to ~340.
3. **Match predictors exactly**, especially add **Hispanic** dummy and ensure race reference category matches.
4. **Compute standardized betas correctly** while keeping intercept on the DV’s original scale (to match constants 2.415 and 7.860), or otherwise acknowledge intercept won’t match if you standardize Y.
5. **Fix the table-building bug** that duplicates/interchanges t/p values (notably const vs no_religion).
6. **Recompute and report R²/Adj R²** from the correctly specified models; they should move toward ~0.145 and ~0.147 once steps 1–3 are correct.

If you paste your model formula(s) and the exact code that constructs `dv1_minority_dislike` and `dv2_remaining_dislike` (plus how you created `hispanic`/race dummies and handled missingness), I can point to the exact lines causing the N drop and the coefficient/SE misalignment.
