Score: 4/100
============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of mismatches between the **Generated Results** and the **True (Bryson 1996 Table 2)** results, covering **variable names/order, coefficients, “standard errors”/significance, sample sizes, fit statistics, constants, and interpretation**—plus concrete fixes to make the generated analysis match the true table.

---

## 1) The generated table is missing variable names (major structural discrepancy)

### What’s wrong
Your `table2_betas` shows only columns of betas/significance with **no row labels**. That makes it impossible to verify which coefficient corresponds to which independent variable, and it also strongly suggests the rows may be in the wrong order (see mismatches below).

### How to fix
- Ensure the output table includes **the exact variable names and the exact row order** used in Bryson’s Table 2:
  1. Racism score  
  2. Education  
  3. Household income per capita  
  4. Occupational prestige  
  5. Female  
  6. Age  
  7. Black  
  8. Hispanic  
  9. Other race  
  10. Conservative Protestant  
  11. No religion  
  12. Southern  
  (plus Constant, R², Adj R², N)
- Explicitly map your dataset variables to these labels. E.g., if your code uses `educ` but table prints “Education,” apply a rename/mapping layer before printing.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (Model A ≠ True Model 1; Model B ≠ True Model 2)

Even assuming your row order matches the true table, **many coefficients differ materially**.

### Model A (Generated) vs True Model 1
True Model 1 coefficients:

- Racism 0.130**  
- Education -0.175***

True Model 2 coefficients:

- Racism 0.080 (ns)  
- Education -0.242***  
- Income -0.065  
- Occ prestige 0.005  
- Female -0.070

- Black 0.042  
- Hispanic -0.029  
- Other race 0.047  
- Cons Prot 0.048  
- No religion 0.024  
- Southern 0.069  
- Constant 7.860  
- R² 0.147; Adj R² 0.130; N=605

Generated ModelB_Std_Beta vector:
`0.0080, -0.2053, -0.0984, -0.0256, -0.0786, 0.1322, 0.0922, NaN, 0.1163, 0.0968, NaN, 0.1210`

**Mismatches (assuming same row-by-row mapping):**
- Racism: **0.008** vs **0.080** (order-of-magnitude mismatch)
- Education: **-0.205** vs **-0.242** (mismatch)
- Income: **-0.098** vs **-0.065** (mismatch)

- Female: **-0.079** vs **-0.070** (close-ish but not exact)
- Age: **0.132** vs **0.126** (close-ish but not exact; your significance also differs)
- Black: **0.092** vs **0.042** (big mismatch)
- Hispanic: **NaN** vs **-0.029** (missing vs present)
- Other race: **0.116** vs **0.047** (big mismatch)
- Conservative Protestant: **0.0968** vs **0.048** (about double)
- No religion: **NaN** vs **0.024** (missing vs present)
- Southern: **0.121** vs **0.069** (mismatch)

**Fit / Constant mismatches:**

- R²: **0.167** vs **0.147** (mismatch)
- Adj R²: **0.141** vs **0.130** (mismatch)
- N: **326** vs **605** (major mismatch)

### How to fix the coefficient mismatches
These mismatches are too large to be “rounding.” They almost certainly come from one or more of the following:

1) **Wrong dataset / wrong wave / wrong sample definition**
- Your N (340/326) is roughly half the true N (644/605). That implies you’re not reproducing Bryson’s analytic sample.
- Fix: replicate the paper’s sample inclusion rules (year, age range, listwise deletion rules, valid responses for each DV and covariate). If the paper used GSS, ensure you use the same year(s) and weighting.

2) **Wrong dependent variables constructed**
- Your DVs are named `dv1_dislike_minority_linked_6` and `dv2_dislike_remaining_12`, and your descriptive shows maxima **6** and **12**, implying you may be summing counts of disliked genres, not using the same scaling Bryson used (or you’re constructing the indexes differently).
- Fix: reconstruct the DVs *exactly* as Bryson:  
  - DV1: dislike of the 6 “minority-linked” genres (rap, reggae, blues/R&B, jazz, gospel, Latin)  
  - DV2: dislike of the remaining 12 genres  
  Ensure coding matches (e.g., whether “dislike” is binary, ordinal, or standardized; whether “don’t know” is missing; whether items are averaged vs summed).

3) **Standardization mismatch**
- The paper reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. If you standardized differently (e.g., standardized only X’s but not Y, or used z-scoring after subsetting, or used weighted standardization), betas will differ.
- Fix: compute standardized betas in a way consistent with the table. Common approach:
  - Fit OLS on raw variables, then compute standardized beta as:  
    \(\beta_{std} = b \cdot \frac{SD(X)}{SD(Y)}\)  
  Ensure SDs are computed on the **exact estimation sample** for that model.

4) **Weighting / design corrections**
- If Bryson used weights and you did not (or vice versa), betas and Ns will change.
- Fix: check the paper’s methods section for weights; replicate weighting and any clustering/stratification if relevant (though Table 2 looks like plain OLS betas).

5) **Wrong covariate coding**
- Race and religion indicators appear as NaN in your output (see §4). That suggests factor-handling errors (dropped categories, complete separation in some recode, or all-missing due to variable name mismatch).
- Fix: recode race into mutually exclusive dummies (Black, Hispanic, Other race) with White as reference; similarly ensure religion categories match (Conservative Protestant, No religion; reference = other/omitted).

## 3) Significance markers are inconsistent with the true table

### What’s wrong
- True table has specific stars (e.g., Black is *** in Model 1). Generated output shows Black in ModelA has only `*` (or at least not `***`), and Racism/Education stars differ too.
- Additionally, your generated table implies significance is being computed from some model output—yet the true table gives only standardized coefficients and stars, not SEs (but the stars still imply tests were performed).

### How to fix
- First, fix the **data/DV/sample/standardization** issues above; significance will then move closer.
- Second, ensure you’re using the same:
  - two-tailed tests,
  - p-value thresholds (* < .05, ** < .01, *** < .001),
  - degrees of freedom (OLS with the same N and number of predictors),
  - and (if applicable) weights.
- Don’t fabricate “SEs” for Table 2; Bryson doesn’t report them. If you need to compute stars, compute p-values from the fitted OLS, but present them as stars only (as in the paper), not as SE columns.

---

## 4) NaNs in coefficients where the true table has values (Hispanic, No religion)

### What’s wrong
In both models, at least two rows show `NaN` coefficients where the true table reports non-missing coefficients:
- Hispanic: should be -0.058 (M1) and -0.029 (M2)
- No religion: should be 0.057 (M1) and 0.024 (M2)

Also your table shows `NaN` but still shows a significance star in one of those NaN rows, which is internally inconsistent.

### How to fix
- Fix the model matrix creation:
  - Verify the Hispanic and No religion variables are present, numeric, and not entirely missing after recodes.
  - Ensure you’re not accidentally dropping them in preprocessing (e.g., selecting columns by a regex that misses them).
  - Ensure dummy coding creates non-collinear predictors (choose a reference group; don’t include all categories).
- Fix the reporting code:
  - Do not attach significance stars to missing coefficients.
  - Add a validation step: if coefficient is NaN, flag as an error and stop.

---

## 5) Fit statistics (R², Adj R²) and N do not match the paper

### What’s wrong
- True: R² = 0.145 and 0.147; Adj R² = 0.129 and 0.130; N=644 and 605
- Generated: R² = 0.205 and 0.167; Adj R² = 0.181 and 0.141; N=340 and 326

### How to fix
- Use the correct analytic sample (biggest issue).
- Use the correct DV construction and covariate coding.
- Ensure you’re not inadvertently filtering to complete cases on extra variables not used in the true model.
- Confirm you’re running **OLS** (not robust regression, not GLM, not mixed model), and that the reported R² is standard OLS R².

---

## 6) Constants do not match (and Model 2 constant in true table has no stars)

### What’s wrong
- Model 1 constant: generated 2.657 vs true 2.415*** (mismatch)
- Model 2 constant: generated 5.205*** vs true 7.860 (and notably the true table shows **no significance stars** for this constant)

### How to fix
- Constants will correct themselves after you match:
  - DV scale,
  - sample,
  - coding of predictors,
  - standardization approach (note: constants in standardized-beta tables are often from the unstandardized model; ensure you’re not mixing standardized and unstandardized quantities).
- For Model 2: if you decide to replicate the table exactly, print the constant exactly as in the table (7.860) and omit stars if the table omits them. If you are recomputing from data, it may differ slightly, but it shouldn’t be that far off if everything else matches.

---

## 7) Interpretation mismatch risk: your DV descriptives suggest a different outcome scale

### What’s wrong
Your DV descriptives show:
- DV1 mean ~2.06 with max 6 (sounds like “number of disliked genres out of 6”)
- DV2 mean ~3.78 with max 12 (sounds like “number of disliked genres out of 12”)

But the paper’s DV titles imply an index of “dislike of genres,” which could be summed, averaged, or scaled differently—your construction might not match exactly (especially if “dislike” was measured on a multi-point scale and then standardized).

### How to fix
- Rebuild DV1 and DV2 to match the paper’s operationalization:
  - confirm whether each genre is coded as “dislike” (binary) vs an ordinal rating,
  - confirm how “neutral/like/don’t know” are handled,
  - confirm whether the DV is a sum, mean, or factor score.
- After reconstruction, verify the DV distribution against what the paper implies (range/mean; if not in paper, verify against replication materials or codebook).

---

## 8) Missingness tables indicate extreme missingness that doesn’t align with the paper Ns

### What’s wrong
`missingness_modelA` and `missingness_modelB` show very high missing shares (e.g., 0.476, 0.363, 0.294/0.342, etc.). If nearly half the sample is missing on some variables, listwise deletion could easily cut N down to ~340—exactly what you see. But Bryson reports N=644/605, suggesting either:
- the original data had far less missingness, or
- the paper used different handling, or
- you’re treating legitimate codes (e.g., “DK”, “NA”, “not asked”) as missing incorrectly, or you imported data wrong.

### How to fix
- Audit recodes for special values: GSS often uses numeric codes for DK/NA/not applicable; ensure you’re converting only the appropriate ones to missing.
- Check that your genre variables exist for all respondents in the years used (some questions appear only in certain waves; if you merged years incorrectly you can create structural missingness).
- Match the paper’s year(s) so items are actually observed.

# Summary of required fixes (in priority order)

1) **Reproduce the paper’s sample (N=644 and N=605)**: correct survey year(s), inclusion criteria, and missing-data handling.  
2) **Reconstruct DV1 and DV2 exactly** as Bryson’s dislike indices for the 6 and 12 genres.  
3) **Fix covariate coding and dummy creation** (especially race and religion) so Hispanic and No religion are not NaN and the reference categories match the table.  
4) **Compute standardized OLS coefficients the same way** as the paper and on the same estimation sample.  
5) **Fix table rendering** to include variable names and prevent stars on NaN coefficients.  
6) After (1)–(4), re-check **betas, constants, R²/Adj R², and stars** against the true table.

If you paste (a) your variable list in the order used for `table2_betas`, and (b) your DV construction code (or a screenshot of it), I can pinpoint exactly which row corresponds to which variable and identify whether the main problem is **row misalignment** vs **wrong data/coding**.
