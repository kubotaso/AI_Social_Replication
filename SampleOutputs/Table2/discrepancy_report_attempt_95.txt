Score: 50/100
============================================================

## 1) Global/documentation mismatches

### A. You report **standard errors**, but the true table does **not**
- **Generated:** no SEs shown, but your prompt asks to check SEs; your generated tables also don’t contain SE columns (only “Std_Beta” and “Sig”).
- **True:** Bryson Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients only** (plus constants, R²/Adj R², N). **No SEs/t-stats** are printed.
- **Fix:** Do **not** invent or display SEs. If you need inference, reproduce exactly the star markers as printed, not calculated from SEs.

### B. You label coefficients as **standardized** but constants as “intercept (unstandardized)” (that part is fine) — however, your **constants don’t match** and Model 2 constant handling is inconsistent
- **True:** Constant M1 = **2.415***; Constant M2 = **7.860** (no stars shown in table excerpt).
- **Generated:** Constant M1 = 2.436632***; Constant M2 = 4.920468***.
- **Fix:** Replace constants with the published ones and match significance exactly (see section 2). Also note: if the paper’s Model 2 constant truly has no stars, do not add them.

### C. Sample size and fit statistics are wrong (big discrepancy)
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 **N=644**, R²=0.145, Adj R²=0.129  
  - Model 2 **N=605**, R²=0.147, Adj R²=0.130
- **Generated:**  
  - Model 1 **N=549**, R²=0.130469, Adj R²=0.111002  
  - Model 2 **N=507**, R²=0.122193, Adj R²=0.100869
- **Fix:** Your analytic sample is not the same as Bryson’s. To match the published table you must replicate:
  1) the **same dataset/year/wave** used in Bryson (GSS-based; you must confirm exact year(s) and exclusions),
  2) the **same variable construction** (especially DV counts and racism scale),
  3) the **same missing-data rule** (likely listwise deletion on the exact set of variables),
  4) the **same weighting** (GSS weight usage if any), and
  5) the **same recodes** for race, religion, region, etc.
  
If you cannot replicate these, you should explicitly label your output as a *non-replication* and stop calling it “Bryson 1996 Table 2”.

## 3) Interpretation mismatches implied by your generated output

### A. Racism effect in Model 2 is interpreted incorrectly if you follow your generated sign
- **Generated Model 2 racism:** negative (~0), implying racism *reduces* dislike of remaining genres.
- **True:** racism is **positive (0.080)**, implying racism is associated with *more* dislike (though not significant).
- **Fix:** Ensure the Model 2 racism coefficient is positive and interpret as small/non-significant.

### B. Race effects in Model 1 are substantially misrepresented
- **Generated:** Black is weakly negative (*), Hispanic is negative and significant (*).
- **True:** Black is strongly negative (**-0.132***), Hispanic is small negative and **not significant**.
- **Fix:** Correct coefficients/stars and rewrite narrative: Black respondents report *less* dislike of minority-linked genres (strong effect); Hispanic coefficient is modest and ns.

### C. Income and “Other race” signs flip relative to the true table (Model 1) and Hispanic flips in Model 2
- These flips will invert substantive conclusions about class and ethnicity.
- **Fix:** Correct signs by using the published coefficients or reconstruct variables to reproduce them.

## 4) How to make the generated analysis match the true table (practical steps)

1) **Stop mixing sources:** decide whether you are (a) reproducing Bryson’s printed Table 2, or (b) running your own regression on a similar dataset. If (a), you must match *exactly*.
2) **Force exact table values** if your goal is a textual replication:
   - Replace each coefficient and star with the published values.
   - Replace R²/Adj R²/N with published values.
   - Do not report SEs.
3) If your goal is a computational replication, you must align:
   - **DV construction** (count of dislikes across the exact same genres and coding of “dislike”),
   - **Racism scale** (items, direction, scaling, standardization),
   - **Race dummies** (reference category and inclusion rules),
   - **Religion categories** (how “Conservative Protestant” defined),
   - **Income per capita** computation (household income/household size; handling of top-codes),
   - **Occupational prestige** scale used (and how missing occupations handled),
   - **Region (South)** definition,
   - **Listwise deletion** on the same variables,
   - Any **weights**.
4) **Formatting fixes:**
   - Label coefficients as “Standardized OLS coefficients (β)”.
   - For constants, keep them as intercepts (not standardized) but match printed values.
   - Use rounding consistent with the table (typically 3 decimals or 2–3).

If you paste the code (or at least the precise variable definitions and missing-data/weight rules) used to generate your “Generated Results,” I can pinpoint *which* construction choices are producing each sign flip (income, racism in Model 2, occupational prestige in Model 2, Hispanic in Model 2, other race in Model 1).
