Score: 23/100
============================================================

### 0) High-level problem
Your **Generated Results** are *not the same analysis* as Bryson (1996) Table 2. They differ on:

- **Sample size** (you have ~259–261 vs. true 605–644)
- **Which coefficients are being reported** (you report standardized betas, but many values don’t match the published standardized betas)
- **Significance stars** (many are wrong, likely due to wrong SEs/df from the wrong sample/model)
- **Treatment of “No religion”** (you dropped it entirely, but the paper estimates it and reports a coefficient)
- **Model constants and DV scales** (your constants don’t match, and your DV descriptives imply different DV construction and/or a different coding range)

Because Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients only** (no SEs shown), any SE comparison is impossible with the “true” table; but we *can* identify that your star assignments (which require SEs/t/p) are inconsistent with the published stars.

## 1) Mismatches in variable names / inclusion

### 1.1 “No religion” is missing/dropped (major mismatch)
- **Generated:** `No religion` is `NaN` and flagged as `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion` in both models.
- **True:** `No religion` is included with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**

**Fix**
- Your analytic sample likely filtered to a subpopulation where `no_religion` is constant (all 0 or all 1), or you coded it incorrectly.
- Recreate the religion dummies exactly as in Bryson and ensure the analytic sample retains variation.
  - Do **not** drop cases in a way that conditions on religion (e.g., restricting to church members).
  - Verify coding: `no_religion = 1` for “none”, `0` otherwise.
  - Ensure the **reference category** for religion matches the paper (likely mainline/other Protestants/Catholics depending on how Bryson coded; at minimum, don’t create mutually exclusive dummies that sum to 1 without omitting a baseline).

### 1.2 Variable naming mostly matches, but your internal names differ
You use internal names like `age_years`, `income_pc`, `occ_prestige`, etc. That’s fine, but the *reported table* names should match the paper exactly (you mostly do). No direct naming mismatch beyond “No religion” being effectively absent.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (all variables)

Below I list **Generated vs True** standardized coefficients, by model.

### Model 1 coefficient mismatches (DV = minority-linked 6 genres)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.139 | 0.130 | value off; stars also off (see §3) |
| Education | -0.260 | -0.175 | **large mismatch** |
| Household income per capita | -0.015 | -0.037 | mismatch |
| Occupational prestige | 0.058 | -0.020 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.033 | -0.057 | mismatch |
| Age | 0.174 | 0.163 | close, but stars differ |
| Black | -0.176 | -0.132 | mismatch magnitude + stars |
| Hispanic | -0.039 | -0.058 | mismatch |
| Other race | 0.002 | -0.017 | mismatch sign (tiny vs negative) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.115 | 0.063 | mismatch magnitude |
| No religion | NaN | 0.057 | **missing** |
| Southern | -0.051 | 0.024 | **sign mismatch** |

### Model 2 coefficient mismatches (DV = remaining 12 genres)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.014 | 0.080 | **sign + large mismatch** |
| Education | -0.165 | -0.242 | large mismatch |
| Household income per capita | -0.081 | -0.065 | mismatch |
| Occupational prestige | -0.081 | 0.005 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.082 | -0.070 | small mismatch |
| Age | 0.123 | 0.126 | close, but stars differ |
| Black | 0.041 | 0.042 | essentially matches |
| Hispanic | -0.054 | -0.029 | mismatch |
| Other race | 0.132 | 0.047 | **large mismatch** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.138 | 0.048 | **large mismatch** |
| No religion | NaN | 0.024 | **missing** |
| Southern | 0.113 | 0.069 | mismatch |

**What these mismatches imply**
These are not “rounding” differences; several are **sign reversals** and large magnitude shifts. That almost always indicates at least one of:

1) **Different sample** (your N is far smaller)  
2) **Different variable coding** (esp. South, prestige, racism scale direction)  
3) **Different model specification** (different omitted/reference categories; extra controls; weighting)  
4) **Standardization mismatch** (you may be standardizing differently than Bryson, or using standardized DV but not standardized IVs, etc.)  
5) **Different DV construction** (your DV range suggests 0–6 and 0–12 counts; that matches the idea, but the constants and means don’t align with Bryson’s estimation sample)

---

## 3) Significance / interpretation mismatches (stars)

### 3.1 Your stars do not match the paper
Examples:

- **Model 1 Age**
  - Generated: `0.173727 **`
  - True: `0.163 ***`
  - Star mismatch

- **Model 1 Black**
  - Generated: `-0.176134 *`
  - True: `-0.132 ***`
  - Star mismatch

- **Model 2 Racism**
  - Generated: no star and negative coefficient
  - True: positive (0.080) and **no star** in the paper, but the sign/value mismatch breaks any interpretation.

**Fix**
- First, match the **sample and coding** (otherwise p-values are meaningless relative to the published ones).
- Second, compute p-values with the same approach as Bryson:
  - OLS with the same df (so N must match).
  - If Bryson uses **survey weights** or design corrections, you must replicate those (GSS often implies weights; Bryson may or may not use them—check the paper’s methods section).
- Third, use the paper’s star thresholds: *p* < .05, .01, .001 (two-tailed).

### 3.2 Interpretation mismatch: you implicitly treat dropped variables as “not estimated”
Because `No religion` is dropped, any written interpretation that compares it to other religious groups will be wrong relative to Table 2.

## 4) Fit statistics and constants mismatches

### 4.1 Sample size (major)
- **Generated N:** 261 (Model 1), 259 (Model 2)
- **True N:** 644 (Model 1), 605 (Model 2)

**Fix**
- Recreate Bryson’s analytic sample rules. Your N indicates you’re doing **complete-case deletion across many items** or applying extra filters.
- Typical causes:
  - You required non-missing for **all 18 genre items** even when constructing each DV separately (this can slash N).
  - You dropped cases with any missing on income, prestige, etc., without using Bryson’s imputation/recodes.
  - You might have restricted to a subgroup (e.g., only whites) accidentally.

Concrete fix approach:
- Construct **DV1** using only the 6 relevant genre dislike items and require non-missing only for those 6 (and the predictors).
- Construct **DV2** using only the remaining 12 items and require non-missing only for those 12 (and predictors).
- Then apply the same predictor-missingness rule Bryson used. If Bryson used listwise deletion, it should still yield ~600+, not ~260—so you are likely requiring too much nonmissingness or mis-merging files.

### 4.2 R² / Adjusted R² mismatch
- **Generated:** R² 0.179 (M1), 0.154 (M2)
- **True:** R² 0.145 (M1), 0.147 (M2)

With a different N and different coefficients, you’ll get different fit—this is expected given the mismatch. Fixing sample/spec will move these toward the published values.

### 4.3 Constant mismatch (and even scale mismatch)
- **Generated constants:** 2.628 (M1), 5.270 (M2)
- **True constants:** 2.415 (M1), 7.860 (M2)

Model 2 constant is *dramatically* different, suggesting your DV2 is on a different scale and/or your predictors are centered/standardized differently than Bryson.

**Fix**
- Bryson reports **standardized coefficients** but the **constant** in the table is in the original DV units given the original X coding (standardized betas do not force an intercept of 0 unless you also center everything and/or standardize DV and all IVs before estimating).
- To match Bryson:
  - Estimate OLS on the **raw DV** and **raw IVs** (with dummies), obtain unstandardized coefficients.
  - Then compute **standardized betas** via \( \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{s_{x_j}}{s_y} \) (keeping intercept as the unstandardized intercept).
  - Do **not** run regression on z-scored variables if you want the intercept to match Bryson’s intercept.

---

## 5) “Standard errors” mismatches
The “True Results” explicitly: **no SEs are reported** in Table 2. So:

- If your generated output includes SEs anywhere (not shown in your tables, but implied by stars), you cannot compare them to Table 2.
- Any claim like “SE mismatch vs paper” would be invalid because the paper doesn’t provide SEs in that table.

**Fix**
- If your goal is to “match Table 2”, remove SE columns from the generated table (or clearly label them as *your computed SEs, not reported in paper*).
- Only compare: coefficients, stars, R²/Adj R², N, and intercept—because those are what the table provides.

---

## 6) Checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1) **Reproduce Bryson’s analytic sample**
   - Use the same year(s) and dataset (Bryson uses 1993 GSS module).
   - Apply the same inclusion rules (music items asked only of certain respondents).
   - Avoid over-restricting to complete cases across *all* music items simultaneously.

2) **Recode variables exactly**
   - Confirm racism scale direction and range; ensure higher = more racist if that’s Bryson’s coding.
   - Confirm South coding (Southern = 1 for South).
   - Confirm race dummies and **reference group** (almost certainly White is baseline).
   - Confirm religion dummies and baseline; ensure `No religion` varies and is not collinear.

3) **Estimate the correct model**
   - OLS with the same predictors as Table 2 (no extra controls, no interactions).
   - Use the same weighting/design if Bryson did (check paper methods).

4) **Compute standardized coefficients the same way**
   - Run OLS with raw variables → compute standardized betas from unstandardized slopes.
   - Do not standardize dummy variables unless you are explicitly replicating Bryson’s method (most published “standardized coefficients” for models with dummies still use the same formula, but you must match his approach).

5) **Apply significance stars using the same p-value computation**
   - After the correct model/sample is matched, stars should align closely.
   - If they still don’t, weighting/design-based SEs are the next suspect.

If you paste your code (or at least: how you construct DV1/DV2, your missing-data rules, and how you compute “Std_Beta”), I can pinpoint exactly which step produces the N collapse and the sign reversals (especially for **Southern**, **Occupational prestige**, and **Racism score in Model 2**).
