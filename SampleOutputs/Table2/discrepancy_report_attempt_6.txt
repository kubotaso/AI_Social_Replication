Score: 22/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name mismatches (and omissions)

**Mismatch A: Model labels / dependent variables**
- **Generated:** `model_2A` and `model_2B` with DVs implied by `dv1_dislike_minority_linked_6` (0–6) and `dv2_dislike_remaining_12` (0–12).
- **True table:** “Model 1” = *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin* (6 genres) and “Model 2” = *Dislike of the 12 remaining genres*.
- **Fix:** Rename generated models to match the paper’s naming:
  - `model_2A` → **Model 1 (6 genres disproportionately liked by Black/Hispanic respondents)**
  - `model_2B` → **Model 2 (12 remaining genres)**

**Mismatch B: Missing predictor in generated output**
- **True table includes:** **No religion** (coef 0.057 in Model 1; 0.024 in Model 2).
- **Generated predictors used:** do **not** include `no_religion`.
- **Fix:** Add the “No religion” indicator to both regressions exactly as the paper does (and ensure the reference category for religion matches Bryson’s coding). Update the predictors list accordingly.

**Mismatch C: Variable naming differences (minor but must be aligned)**
Generated uses shorthand names; true table uses readable labels:
- `educ` → **Education**
- `income_pc` → **Household income per capita**
- `prestg80` → **Occupational prestige**
- `cons_prot` → **Conservative Protestant**
- `southern` → **Southern**
- `racism_score`, `female`, `age`, `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` align conceptually.
- **Fix:** In the output table, relabel variables to match the paper’s labels (or rename variables before modeling) so the table is directly comparable.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (every coefficient that differs)

Below I align generated Model 2A with **True Model 1**, and generated Model 2B with **True Model 2**.

#### Model 1 (True) vs Generated model_2A

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.140* | 0.130** | value + stars differ |
| Education | -0.259*** | -0.175*** | too negative |
| Income per capita | -0.012 | -0.037 | too close to 0 |
| Occupational prestige | 0.058 | -0.020 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.034 | -0.057 | smaller magnitude |
| Age | 0.175** | 0.163*** | value + stars differ |
| Black | -0.177* | -0.132*** | too negative + stars differ |
| Hispanic | -0.007 | -0.058 | too close to 0 |
| Other race | -0.005 | -0.017 | too close to 0 |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.120 | 0.063 | too large |
| **No religion** | (missing) | 0.057 | omitted variable |
| Southern | -0.059 | 0.024 | wrong sign |

#### Model 2 (True) vs Generated model_2B

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.013 | 0.080 | wrong sign |
| Education | -0.165* | -0.242*** | too small magnitude + stars differ |
| Income per capita | -0.077 | -0.065 | close but not exact |
| Occupational prestige | -0.079 | 0.005 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.082 | -0.070 | close-ish but not exact |
| Age | 0.127* | 0.126** | stars differ |
| Black | 0.039 | 0.042 | close-ish but not exact |
| Hispanic | -0.023 | -0.029 | close-ish but not exact |
| Other race | 0.122* | 0.047 | much too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.142* | 0.048 | much too large |
| **No religion** | (missing) | 0.024 | omitted variable |
| Southern | 0.104 | 0.069 | too large |

**Core implication:** the generated regressions are not reproducing Bryson’s Table 2 coefficients. Some differences could be sampling/weights/coding; others (wrong sign for racism score in Model 2; wrong sign for prestige and southern; missing “No religion”) strongly suggest specification/coding mismatches.

---

### 3) Standard errors: generated includes them implicitly (stars), but the true table does not report SEs

- **True results:** “Table 2 … does not report standard errors.”
- **Generated:** provides significance stars, which implies the analysis computed SEs/t-tests and then assigned stars.
- **Mismatch:** You cannot “match” Bryson’s table on SEs because none are provided; also your star pattern should match the paper’s stars if you want comparability, but it currently does not.
- **Fix options:**
  1. **Remove SEs/t-tests/stars from the generated table** and present only standardized betas (closest to what the paper prints), OR
  2. Keep stars but ensure they match by replicating Bryson’s exact estimation setup (sample, weights, listwise deletion, variable coding). Then compare stars as a secondary check.

---

### 4) Fit-statistic and sample-size mismatches (major)

**N**
- **Generated:** N=261 (Model 2A) and 259 (Model 2B)
- **True:** N=644 (Model 1) and 605 (Model 2)
- **Fix:** Your analytic sample is far smaller than the paper’s. To match:
  - Use the same dataset/wave and same inclusion criteria as Bryson.
  - Apply the same handling of missing data (Bryson likely used **listwise deletion**, but on a much larger starting sample; your missingness output suggests extremely high missingness).
  - Ensure you’re not accidentally restricting to a subsample (e.g., only one race, only one module, only complete cases on extra variables not in the table, etc.).

**R² / Adjusted R²**
- **Generated:** R²=0.178 (A) and 0.151 (B)
- **True:** R²=0.145 (Model 1) and 0.147 (Model 2)
- **Fix:** Once you fix sample size/coding/weights and include “No religion,” R² should move. But as long as N is ~260, you’re not replicating the same model.

**Constant**
- **Generated:** 2.592*** (A) and 5.185*** (B)
- **True:** 2.415*** (Model 1) and 7.860 (Model 2; notably printed without stars)
- **Fix:** Intercept differences reflect:
  - different DV scaling/construction,
  - different sample,
  - possibly standardization choices (see next section).
  Also: if the paper standardized only *predictors* but not DV (or vice versa), the intercept will differ. You need to match the paper’s standardization exactly.

---

### 5) Standardization/interpretation mismatch (standardized OLS coefficients)

- **True table:** explicitly **standardized OLS coefficients**.
- **Generated:** columns are called `beta_model_2A` / `beta_model_2B`, which *suggest* standardized betas, but:
  - Your intercept is nonzero and your DV descriptives show raw scales (0–6, 0–12). That’s fine if you standardized only X’s and not Y, but the paper says “standardized OLS coefficients” (usually meaning standardized betas; many authors standardize variables or compute beta post-hoc).
- **Fix:** Determine how Bryson computed “standardized coefficients.” Two common approaches:
  1. **Post-estimation beta**: run OLS on unstandardized variables, then convert slopes to betas:  
     \(\beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}\)
  2. **Z-score standardization**: regress z(Y) on z(X)’s (then intercept ≈ 0).
  
  To match Bryson, you must replicate the method used in the paper (or its codebook/appendix). If you standardize differently, the betas won’t match even with identical raw coefficients.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatches implied by signs/stars

Because several signs differ from the true table, any narrative interpretation based on the generated results would contradict Bryson. The biggest interpretation errors you would make if you used the generated output:

- **Racism score (Model 2):** Generated is slightly negative; true is positive (0.080).  
  *Fix:* correct coding of racism scale (reverse coding is a common culprit), and ensure you’re using the same items/scale construction.
- **Occupational prestige:** Generated wrong sign in both models relative to true (true ≈ 0/negative small in Model 1; ≈ 0 positive in Model 2).  
  *Fix:* verify prestige variable coding and whether it’s logged/standardized; also verify you didn’t swap in a different prestige measure.
- **Southern (Model 1):** Generated negative; true positive.  
  *Fix:* check regional dummy coding (1=south vs 1=non-south reversed).
- **Education magnitude:** Generated much more negative in Model 1 and much less negative in Model 2 than true.  
  *Fix:* check education coding (years vs categories; reversed; or inclusion of different education measure).

---

### 7) Missingness outputs indicate the replication setup is not comparable

- Generated missingness shares (e.g., 0.476, 0.363, etc.) suggest a very high fraction missing on key variables, leading to N≈260.
- **Fix:**
  - Ensure you’re using the correct base sample (paper N’s are >600).
  - Recode “don’t know / refused / not asked” consistently with Bryson (often set to missing, but if you treat valid skips incorrectly you can drop half the sample).
  - Don’t include extra variables in the model frame beyond those in Table 2 (extra controls with missing data will shrink N).

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true Table 2

1. **Add the missing predictor:** include **No religion** (and match the reference group for religion).
2. **Match the sample:** reproduce Bryson’s inclusion criteria so N≈644 and N≈605 (not ~260). This is the single biggest problem.
3. **Match coding precisely:**
   - Racism scale direction (higher = more racism? make sure it matches).
   - Southern dummy direction.
   - Occupational prestige measure and direction.
   - Education and income-per-capita construction.
4. **Match the standardization method** used for “standardized OLS coefficients.”
5. **Match weighting/design** if Bryson used survey weights (common in GSS-style analyses). If weights were used and you didn’t, coefficients and significance can shift.
6. **Align reporting to the paper:**
   - If you want to match exactly, report **only standardized coefficients** (no SEs) and use the paper’s star scheme only if you can reproduce it.

If you share (a) your model formula/code, (b) how each variable is coded/constructed, and (c) what dataset/sample restriction you used, I can pinpoint which specific coding choice is causing each sign/magnitude discrepancy (especially racism score, southern, and prestige).
