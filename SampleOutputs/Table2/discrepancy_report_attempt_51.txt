### 1) Variable-name / model-specification mismatches

**A. Missing predictors in the generated tables**
- **True Table 2 includes:** `Hispanic` and `No religion` (both models).
- **Generated models:** explicitly report **dropping** `hispanic, no_religion` as “zero variance predictors,” and they do **not appear** in the coefficient tables.

**Why this is a mismatch**
- In the paper, those variables clearly vary (nonzero variance) and are estimated.
- Dropping them changes the model specification and can change *all* coefficients.

**How to fix**
- Recreate `hispanic` and `no_religion` correctly from the GSS 1993 data (and ensure they’re coded with variation).
- Most common causes of “zero variance” here:
  1. You filtered to a subsample with no Hispanics / no nonreligious respondents (e.g., race-restricted sample, or listwise deletion accidentally removed them all).
  2. You miscoded them (e.g., set all missing to 0, or created a constant due to a faulty recode).
- Validate with:
  - `table(hispanic)` and `table(no_religion)` (or value counts)
  - check after **all** filtering and listwise deletion used for each model.

---

**B. Different dependent variables / sample definitions**
- **True Model 1 DV:** “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin”
- **Generated ModelA name:** `dislike_minority6` (sounds consistent), **but**
  - **True N = 644**, generated **N = 327** (about half).
- **True Model 2 DV:** “Dislike of the 12 remaining genres”
- **Generated ModelB name:** `dislike_other12` (sounds consistent), **but**
  - **True N = 605**, generated **N = 308** (again about half).

**Why this is a mismatch**
- Even if the DV construction is right, the sample is not: your N is ~50% of the paper’s.
- Coefficients and significance won’t match if you use a different sample (e.g., wrong year(s), wrong age restriction, missing-data handling, or different weighting).

**How to fix**
- Confirm you are using **GSS 1993** and the same inclusion rules as Bryson (1996).
- Replicate the paper’s missing-data approach:
  - If the paper used listwise deletion, you should too—but your N should then match roughly.
  - If you are inadvertently applying extra filters (e.g., complete cases on variables not in the model; dropping “don’t know/refused” too aggressively; restricting to whites only), remove them.
- Check each model’s analytic sample size step-by-step (start from GSS1993 music module respondents, then apply each exclusion).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (signs, magnitudes, and significance)

Below I compare **standardized coefficients** (because Table 2 reports standardized betas). Your “paper style” tables appear to be using `beta_std`, so that’s the right quantity to compare—except your stars are often wrong (see section 4).

#### Model 1 (True) vs Generated ModelA (beta_std)

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130** (**) | **0.139** (*) | close magnitude, **significance marker differs** |
| Education | -0.175 (***) | -0.261 (***) | too negative (larger in magnitude) |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | close |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | +0.030 | **sign flips** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.026 | smaller (closer to 0) |
| Age | 0.163 (***) | 0.191 (***) | larger |
| Black | -0.132 (***) | -0.127 (*) | magnitude close, **stars way off** |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | **missing/dropped** | **spec mismatch** |
| Other race | -0.017 | +0.004 | **sign flips** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.063 | 0.079 | somewhat larger |
| No religion | 0.057 | **missing/dropped** | **spec mismatch** |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.022 | close |
| Constant (unstandardized) | 2.415 (***) | 2.654 (***) | differs (likely sample/spec differences) |

Key substantive problems in Model 1:
- Wrong **sign** for occupational prestige and other race.
- Missing Hispanic and no religion.
- Stars don’t match the paper (even where betas are close).

#### Model 2 (True) vs Generated ModelB (beta_std)

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 (ns) | -0.005 (ns) | **sign + magnitude wrong** |
| Education | -0.242 (***) | -0.224 (***) | close |
| HH income pc | -0.065 | -0.095 | too negative |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.012 | small but **sign flips** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.091 | more negative |
| Age | 0.126 (**) | 0.091 (ns) | too small; lost significance |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.112 (≈p .056) | much larger |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **missing/dropped** | **spec mismatch** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.132 (*) | much larger; significance differs |
| Cons Protestant | 0.048 | 0.080 | larger |
| No religion | 0.024 | **missing/dropped** | **spec mismatch** |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.142 (**) | much larger |
| Constant | 7.860 (no stars in paper) | 5.674 (***) | not comparable; likely different DV scaling/sample |

Key substantive problems in Model 2:
- Racism effect is completely different (true positive .080 vs generated ~0).
- Several covariates inflated (south, other race, black).
- Missing Hispanic and no religion again.

**How to fix coefficient mismatches (general)**
These mismatches overwhelmingly point to **different data, coding, weighting, or sample selection**, not just random noise:
1. **Use the same dataset/year and module** (GSS 1993 music questions).
2. **Reproduce the DV construction exactly** (which genres count in each DV).
3. **Recode predictors to match the paper** (especially racism scale construction and category codings for race/religion/region).
4. **Apply the same weights** if the paper did. (Bryson’s table may be weighted; if you ran unweighted OLS, you can shift betas and p-values.)
5. **Match missing-data handling** (listwise deletion on exactly the table variables, not on extras).

### 3) Standard errors: generated vs true

**True results:** Table 2 **does not report standard errors at all.**  
**Generated results:** include `std_err`, `t`, `p_value`.

**Mismatch**
- You cannot “compare” SEs to Table 2 because they aren’t provided there.
- Any claim that your SEs “match the paper” would be invalid.

**How to fix**
- If your goal is to match Table 2, **do not present SEs as if they came from Table 2**.
- Instead:
  - report only standardized coefficients and stars **based on your fitted model’s p-values**, while clearly stating these are computed from your replication dataset, not extracted from the table; or
  - if you must compare SEs, use another source (appendix, replication files, or compute them and label them as *replication-estimated SEs*).

### 4) Significance stars and interpretation mismatches

Even when coefficients are close, your **stars often conflict** with the paper.

#### Examples (Model 1)
- **Racism score**
  - True: **0.130\*\*** (p<.01)
  - Generated: 0.139\* with p=0.0125 (so * by your p-values)
  - This indicates your model yields weaker evidence than the paper—again consistent with wrong sample/weights/spec.

- **Black**
  - True: -0.132\*\*\* (p<.001)
  - Generated: -0.127\* with p=0.0256
  - That’s a *major* inferential mismatch.

#### Example (Model 2)
- **Age**
  - True: 0.126\*\*
  - Generated: 0.091 (no star) with p≈0.11

**How to fix**
- Stars must be based on the same p-values the original authors would have obtained, which requires:
  1. same sample,
  2. same model specification (including hispanic and no religion),
  3. same weighting and variance estimation choices (robust vs conventional),
  4. same DV construction and scaling.

---

### 5) “Standardized coefficients” vs what you produced

**True Table 2:** reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas).  
**Generated tables:** show:
- a “paper style” table that looks like it uses the standardized coefficients (`coef` matches `beta_std` values),
- plus “full” tables with both unstandardized and standardized.

**Potential mismatch**
- Your “Constant” is treated like the other terms in the “paper style” table, but constants are not standardized. In the paper, they still show a constant, but the table is described as standardized coefficients; this is a known presentation quirk. Still, be careful not to imply the constant is standardized.

**How to fix**
- In your “paper style” table, label columns clearly:
  - `beta` for standardized coefficients for predictors
  - `constant (unstd)` separately
- Or omit the constant if you want a purely standardized table.

### 6) Bottom-line: what you must change to match the paper

To make the generated analysis match Table 2, you need to align **four things**, in this order:

1. **Analytic sample (N must match):** get Model 1 N≈644 and Model 2 N≈605.  
2. **Include all predictors from Table 2:** do not drop `hispanic` and `no_religion`; fix their coding/filters.  
3. **Correct variable coding/scale construction:** especially `racism_score`, race dummies, religion categories, region, and DV genre groupings.  
4. **Use the same estimation conventions:** weighting (if used), and same handling of missing values and category exclusions.

If you share your variable construction code (or at least: how you built `racism_score`, the two DVs, and the filters that lead to N=327/308), I can pinpoint exactly where the divergence starts and specify the exact recode/selection changes needed.
