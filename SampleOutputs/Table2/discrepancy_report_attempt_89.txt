Score: 40/100
============================================================

Below is a variable-by-variable audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True Results (Bryson 1996 Table 2)**, plus what you must change so the generated analysis matches the published table.

---

## 0) Global / structural mismatches (affect everything)

### A. Wrong sample sizes (N)
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=438; Model 2 N=406  
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605  
**Fix:** Your analytic sample construction is not replicating Bryson’s. To match Table 2 you must:
1. Use the same survey/wave and inclusion criteria as Bryson (1996).
2. Apply the same missing-data handling (likely **listwise deletion on the full model** but with a larger starting N than yours).
3. Ensure DV construction uses the same “strict” definition Bryson used (your labels say “strict”—but your N collapse suggests you’re dropping many more cases than Bryson).
4. Verify you are not inadvertently dropping cases via merges, recodes, or filtering to a subset.

### B. Fit statistics don’t match (R², Adj R²)
- **Generated:**  
  - Model 1 R²=0.1258; Adj R²=0.1011  
  - Model 2 R²=0.1265; Adj R²=0.0998
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R²=0.145; Adj R²=0.129  
  - Model 2 R²=0.147; Adj R²=0.130  
**Fix:** Once you fix the **sample** and **DV coding**, R² should move toward the published values. If it still doesn’t:
- confirm you are running **OLS** on the **count DV** exactly as Bryson did (not Poisson/negative binomial; not weighted vs unweighted mismatch).
- confirm all predictors are coded identically (especially region, religion, race categories).

### C. Intercepts (constants) don’t match—and Model 2 constant is especially wrong
- **Generated:** Constant M1=2.594***; M2=5.496***  
- **True:** Constant M1=2.415***; M2=7.860 (no sig stars shown in the paper)  
**Fix:** Intercepts will not match until (i) sample and (ii) DV scaling match. The Model 2 constant discrepancy (5.50 vs 7.86) strongly suggests your **DV2 scale/distribution** differs from Bryson’s (e.g., different count range, different “strict” rule, or different set of genres).

### D. You report “standard errors” nowhere, which is fine—but don’t imply them
- **True note:** “does not report standard errors.”
- **Generated:** also does not show SEs, but your prompt asks to check SEs. There are **no SEs to compare**, so any SEs you generated would be non-comparable to Table 2.
**Fix:** If you want to match Table 2, **do not output SEs** (or clearly separate your computed SEs from the published table). Only compare standardized betas and significance stars.

### E. Potential standardization mismatch
Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients**, but your intercept is **unstandardized** (as it should be; standardized models typically omit a meaningful intercept).
**Fix:** Ensure the coefficients you compare to Bryson are **standardized betas**, not unstandardized b’s. (Your tables label them “Beta (standardized)”—good—but mismatches below indicate the underlying data/coding is off.)

## 1) Model 1 coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches

DV: *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music*

For each variable: **Generated vs True** (and significance), then fix.

### Racism score
- **Generated:** 0.125593 *  
- **True:** 0.130 **  
**Mismatch:** coefficient slightly smaller; **significance level wrong** (* vs **).  
**Fix:** With correct N (644) and correct coding, the p-value should tighten. Also ensure racism scale coding direction matches Bryson (higher = more racist).

### Education
- **Generated:** -0.205293 ***  
- **True:** -0.175 ***  
**Mismatch:** effect too negative.  
**Fix:** education coding likely differs (years vs categories, or top-coding). Use Bryson’s exact education measure.

### Household income per capita
- **Generated:** +0.033918 (ns)  
- **True:** -0.037 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** **sign reversed**.  
**Fix:** You almost certainly constructed income incorrectly relative to Bryson:
- per-capita transformation differs, or
- coding reversed, or
- you used raw income rather than the paper’s per-capita measure, or
- inflation/units scaling not the issue for standardized beta sign—sign reversal suggests **conceptual inversion** or recode error.
Replicate Bryson’s “household income per capita” definition exactly.

### Occupational prestige
- **Generated:** +0.007852 (ns)  
- **True:** -0.020 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** sign reversed (though both small).  
**Fix:** Use the same prestige index and coding; verify that higher values mean **higher prestige** (not lower). Also check whether Bryson used respondent vs household prestige.

### Female
- **Generated:** -0.072497 (ns)  
- **True:** -0.057 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** magnitude off.  
**Fix:** minor; likely resolves with correct sample and weights (if any).

### Age
- **Generated:** 0.147219 **  
- **True:** 0.163 ***  
**Mismatch:** coefficient smaller; significance too weak (** vs ***).  
**Fix:** sample size/weights again; confirm age is in years (and not capped or grouped).

### Black
- **Generated:** -0.157248 **  
- **True:** -0.132 ***  
**Mismatch:** coefficient more negative; significance level wrong (** vs ***).  
**Fix:** race dummy construction and reference category must match. With proper N, it should likely become ***. Also check if Bryson’s “Black” excludes multiracial cases (your “other_race” handling may differ).

### Hispanic
- **Generated:** -0.039695 (ns)  
- **True:** -0.058 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** smaller magnitude.  
**Fix:** race/ethnicity coding differences or sample restriction.

### Other race
- **Generated:** +0.006195 (ns)  
- **True:** -0.017 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** sign reversed.  
**Fix:** “Other race” category definition differs (e.g., includes Asians vs multiracial vs Native American). Harmonize to Bryson’s coding.

### Conservative Protestant
- **Generated:** 0.094829 (ns)  
- **True:** 0.063 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** too large.  
**Fix:** your religious tradition coding likely doesn’t match Bryson’s “Conservative Protestant” classification scheme.

### No religion
- **Generated:** 0.066177 (ns)  
- **True:** 0.057 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** small magnitude difference.  
**Fix:** probably resolves with sample/weights.

### Southern
- **Generated:** -0.016474 (ns)  
- **True:** +0.024 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** **sign reversed**.  
**Fix:** your South indicator is likely miscoded (e.g., 1=non-South). Verify region coding and reference.

### Constant
- **Generated:** 2.594476 ***  
- **True:** 2.415 ***  
**Mismatch:** intercept too high.  
**Fix:** DV scaling/sample.

## 2) Model 2 coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches

DV: *Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres*

### Racism score
- **Generated:** -0.033146 (ns)  
- **True:** +0.080 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** **sign reversed and much smaller**.  
**Fix:** This is a major red flag for either:
- DV2 is not constructed the same way (genres included differ, strict rule differs), and/or
- racism scale coding reversed, and/or
- sample differs substantially (it does: 406 vs 605).
Rebuild DV2 exactly from Bryson’s “12 remaining genres” list and replicate the racism scale.

### Education
- **Generated:** -0.219268 ***  
- **True:** -0.242 ***  
**Mismatch:** too weak (less negative).  
**Fix:** education coding + sample.

### Household income per capita
- **Generated:** -0.030556 (ns)  
- **True:** -0.065 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** magnitude too small.  
**Fix:** income construction.

### Occupational prestige
- **Generated:** -0.029396 (ns)  
- **True:** +0.005 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** sign reversed.  
**Fix:** prestige coding/measure mismatch again.

### Female
- **Generated:** -0.076595 (ns)  
- **True:** -0.070 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** small.

### Age
- **Generated:** 0.111361 *  
- **True:** 0.126 **  
**Mismatch:** coefficient smaller; sig level too weak.  
**Fix:** sample size and/or weights.

### Black
- **Generated:** 0.048495 (ns)  
- **True:** 0.042 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** small.

### Hispanic
- **Generated:** -0.013671 (ns)  
- **True:** -0.029 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** smaller magnitude.

### Other race
- **Generated:** 0.079242 (ns)  
- **True:** 0.047 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** too large.

### Conservative Protestant
- **Generated:** 0.104997 (ns)  
- **True:** 0.048 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** much too large.  
**Fix:** religion coding scheme mismatch.

### No religion
- **Generated:** 0.015341 (ns)  
- **True:** 0.024 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** small.

### Southern
- **Generated:** 0.083143 (ns)  
- **True:** 0.069 (ns)  
**Mismatch:** slightly larger.

### Constant
- **Generated:** 5.496123 ***  
- **True:** 7.860 (no stars printed)  
**Mismatch:** very large.  
**Fix:** DV2 construction (almost certainly) and sample.

---

## 3) Variable name mismatches / presentation issues

### A. Age naming
- **Generated variable shown in sample:** `age_years` but table label is “Age”
- **True:** “Age”
**Fix:** This is cosmetic unless you accidentally used a different variable in modeling. Ensure the model actually used `age_years` and label consistently.

### B. Race/ethnicity categories
- **Generated:** `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` are 0/1 indicators.  
- **True:** same conceptual categories, but “Other race” definition is ambiguous and often differs across datasets.
**Fix:** Document and match Bryson’s race coding rules exactly.

### C. DV naming suggests “strict” construction
- **Generated:** DV described as “(count of 6; strict)” and “(count of 12; strict)”
- **True:** doesn’t use your “strict” wording; but the genre sets are specific.
**Fix:** Make sure your “strict” rule matches Bryson’s (e.g., what response categories count as “dislike”; how neutrals/missing are handled; whether “don’t know” is excluded vs treated as not-dislike).

---

## 4) Interpretation mismatches (direction and substantive claims)

Even if you didn’t write narrative text, the **sign reversals** force different interpretations than Bryson:

- **Model 1 income:** Generated implies higher income → *more* dislike of minority-linked genres; True implies higher income → *less* dislike (though ns).  
- **Model 1 South:** Generated implies Southerners dislike minority-linked genres *less*; True implies *more* (ns).  
- **Model 2 racism:** Generated implies higher racism → *less* dislike of remaining genres; True implies *more* dislike (ns).  
These are not trivial: they change the story.

**Fix:** Do not write substantive interpretation until your coding/sample replicate the published direction for these variables.

---

## 5) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Reconstruct both DVs exactly as Bryson (1996):**
   - Confirm the exact 6 “minority-linked” genres list and the exact “remaining 12” list.
   - Confirm what response options count as “dislike” and how missing/DK are treated.
   - Confirm the DV range (0–6 and 0–12) matches Bryson’s.

2. **Replicate the analytic sample sizes (644 and 605):**
   - Start from the same base dataset and population restrictions.
   - Apply the same missingness rules.
   - Check you aren’t dropping cases by requiring non-missing on variables not in Bryson’s model.

3. **Replicate predictor coding:**
   - **Income per capita:** same transformation and direction.
   - **Prestige:** same prestige scale and direction.
   - **South:** verify 1=South, 0=non-South (not reversed).
   - **Religion:** recreate “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” using Bryson’s classification.

4. **Run OLS and report standardized betas + sig stars:**
   - Use standardized coefficients for predictors.
   - Keep intercept unstandardized (fine), but expect it to match only once DV/sample match.
   - Match star thresholds (*, **, ***) and use two-tailed tests.

5. **Only then compare coefficients:**
   - Your remaining differences in magnitude should shrink substantially once the above are aligned.

If you share (a) the exact genre list and dislike coding you used, (b) how you computed income per capita and prestige, and (c) your missing-data filtering code, I can pinpoint which specific recode/filter is producing each sign reversal and the N drop.
