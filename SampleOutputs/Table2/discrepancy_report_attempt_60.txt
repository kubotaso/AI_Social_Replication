Score: 23/100
============================================================

### A. First, a structural mismatch: what the paper reports vs what you generated
**True Table 2 reports only standardized coefficients (beta) and significance stars. It does *not* report standard errors, t-stats, or p-values.**  
Your “Generated Results” include **unstandardized coefficients, standard errors, t, p-values, and posthoc standardized betas**. That cannot be directly compared to Table 2, and any SE/p-value comparison is invalid.

**Fix:** To match the paper, output **only standardized coefficients** (and optionally stars computed from p-values if you have the microdata). Do **not** present SEs as if they came from the PDF. If you don’t have the data, you cannot recreate p-values/stars.

## B. Model-level mismatches (N, R², Adj. R², and k)

### Model A (paper Model 1)
- **N**
  - Generated: **456**
  - True: **644**
  - **Mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** Use the correct sample and missing-data handling consistent with Bryson (1996). Your analysis is using a restricted subset (complete-case listwise deletion, different GSS year, different recodes, or different DV construction).

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.1403, Adj R² = 0.1210**
  - True: **R² = .145, Adj R² = .129**
  - **Mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** Once N and variable construction match the paper, refit with the same covariates and coding. Small R² differences can also come from weighting decisions (GSS weights) or slightly different item lists in the DV.

- **Number of predictors (k)**
  - Generated fit table says **k = 11**
  - True table includes **12 predictors + constant** (Racism, Education, Income, Prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern) + Constant.
  - Your *full* output shows **11 rows including the constant**, i.e., **10 predictors + constant**.
  - **Mismatch: you are missing (at least) two covariates** relative to the paper.
  - **Fix:** Ensure all Table 2 covariates are included. Specifically, your generated coefficient table has 11 rows total; the paper’s model has 13 rows total (12 covariates + constant).

### Model B (paper Model 2)
- **N**
  - Generated: **456**
  - True: **605**
  - **Mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** Same as above; your sample construction is not reproducing the paper.

- **R² / Adjusted R²**
  - Generated: **R² = 0.1214, Adj R² = 0.1016**
  - True: **R² = .147, Adj R² = .130**
  - **Mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** Correct DV construction (“12 remaining genres”), correct sample, correct weights, correct predictors.

- **k / missing predictors**
  - Generated: again **11 rows including constant**
  - True: **12 predictors + constant**
  - **Mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** include the missing variables (and confirm Southern is included; it appears in the true table but is not identifiable in your output due to missing variable names).

---

## C. Variable-name/reporting mismatches (you omitted variable labels)
Your “paper_style” tables list **only numeric rows**, no variable names. That makes it impossible to verify correspondence row-by-row.

**Fix:** Add the variable names exactly as in the paper (or an explicit crosswalk). E.g., output:

- Racism score  
- Education  
- Household income per capita  
- Occupational prestige  
- Female  
- Age  
- Black  
- Hispanic  
- Other race  
- Conservative Protestant  
- No religion  
- Southern  
- Constant  

Right now, your results cannot be audited for mapping errors.

---

## D. Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas compared to true standardized betas)

Your only comparable quantity to Table 2 is **`beta_std_posthoc`** (since the paper reports standardized coefficients). Comparing those to the true coefficients:

### Model A (true Model 1 betas vs generated standardized betas)
Below I match by *expected sign/magnitude*; because you didn’t provide variable names, this mapping is tentative, but mismatches are clear.

- **Racism score**
  - True: **0.130** (**)  
  - Generated: **0.124** (*)  
  - **Mismatch in significance (and slightly in beta).**
  - **Fix:** With correct N/model spec/coding, it should typically become **~0.13 and p<.01**. The weaker significance is consistent with your smaller N and/or different DV.

- **Education**
  - True: **-0.175***  
  - Generated: **-0.259***  
  - **Mismatch in magnitude (too negative).**
  - **Fix:** Education coding may differ (years vs degree categories), DV may be constructed differently, or sample differs. Use Bryson’s coding and genre list.

- **Income per capita**
  - True: **-0.037** (ns)  
  - Generated: **-0.051** (ns)  
  - Close-ish; not a major discrepancy.

- **Prestige**
  - True: **-0.020** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.079** (ns)  
  - **Sign mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** You may be using a different prestige measure, reverse-coded prestige, or an occupational status proxy.

- **Female**
  - True: **-0.057** (ns)  
  - Generated: **-0.010** (ns)  
  - **Magnitude mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** verify coding (female=1 vs male=1), sample composition, and whether sex is included at all (remember you appear to be missing predictors).

- **Age**
  - True: **0.163***  
  - Generated: **0.096** (*)  
  - **Magnitude and significance mismatch (too small; weaker).**
  - **Fix:** Age may be top-coded/centered differently; again, smaller N reduces precision, but the beta size suggests different DV or included controls.

- **Black**
  - True: **-0.132***  
  - Generated: **-0.149** (**)  
  - Similar direction/magnitude, but significance slightly weaker. Could be sample and covariate differences.

- **Hispanic**
  - True: **-0.058** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.027** (ns)  
  - **Sign mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** likely miscoding of Hispanic indicator, different reference category, or misalignment of which row corresponds to Hispanic (again because variable names are missing).

- **Other race**
  - True: **-0.017** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.077** (ns)  
  - **Sign mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** race coding/referencing problem (e.g., using a different baseline or combining categories differently).

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - True: **0.063** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.077** (ns)  
  - Close.

- **No religion**
  - True: **0.057** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.026** (ns)  
  - Smaller.

- **Southern**
  - True: **0.024** (ns)  
  - Generated: (no clear match; you have 11 rows total so you’re likely missing Southern and/or one of the religion/race dummies)
  - **Mismatch / missing variable.**
  - **Fix:** include Southern; ensure region is coded the same as Bryson.

- **Constant**
  - True: **2.415***  
  - Generated unstd constant: **2.682***  
  - **Mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** constant differs when DV construction, sample, and scaling differ. Also: the paper’s constant is not standardized; comparing constants only makes sense if DV and coding match.

### Model B (true Model 2 betas vs generated standardized betas)

Key mismatches (again, only betas are comparable):

- **Racism score**
  - True: **0.080** (ns)  
  - Generated: **-0.015** (ns)  
  - **Sign mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** DV likely not “12 remaining genres” as in paper, or racism scale coded differently (reverse-coded), or row misalignment due to missing labels.

- **Education**
  - True: **-0.242***  
  - Generated: **-0.219***  
  - Close.

- **Income per capita**
  - True: **-0.065** (ns)  
  - Generated: **-0.050** (ns)  
  - Close.

- **Prestige**
  - True: **0.005** (ns)  
  - Generated: **-0.022** (ns)  
  - Slight sign mismatch (small either way).

- **Female**
  - True: **-0.070** (ns)  
  - Generated: **-0.070** (ns, matches your beta -0.0699 row)  
  - This one matches well (but only if that row truly is Female).

- **Age**
  - True: **0.126** (**)  
  - Generated: **0.055** (ns)  
  - **Magnitude/significance mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** confirm age measurement and DV; also confirm you didn’t accidentally include a transformed age (e.g., age^2) without stating it.

- **Black**
  - True: **0.042** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.055** (ns)  
  - Close.

- **Hispanic**
  - True: **-0.029** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.033** (ns)  
  - **Sign mismatch.**  
  - **Fix:** Hispanic coding/reference mismatch or row misassignment.

- **Other race**
  - True: **0.047** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.068** (ns)  
  - Close.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - True: **0.048** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.114** (*)  
  - **Magnitude and significance mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** different religion categorization, different base category, or omitted covariates causing confounding.

- **No religion**
  - True: **0.024** (ns)  
  - Generated: **0.122** (**)  
  - **Major mismatch (too large; becomes significant).**
  - **Fix:** same as above; also suggests the model is not the same specification/sample.

- **Southern**
  - True: **0.069** (ns)  
  - Generated: not clearly present / model too short  
  - **Missing variable.**
  - **Fix:** include Southern and ensure correct coding.

- **Constant**
  - True: **7.860**  
  - Generated: **5.577***  
  - **Mismatch.**
  - **Fix:** DV is almost certainly different (scale/genre count differs), and/or your sample differs.

---

## E. Standard errors & p-values: interpretation mismatches
- You present **p-values and stars** as if they correspond to the paper’s table. But **the paper’s stars attach to standardized coefficients in a specific sample/specification**; your stars reflect your own regression run (with different N/spec), and SEs are not available from the paper table.
- You also imply “standard errors” are comparable to the “true results”—they are not reported in the true table at all.

**Fix:**  
1) If your goal is to replicate Bryson’s Table 2, do not show SEs unless you are explicitly estimating them from the GSS microdata.  
2) If you do have the microdata, then compute standardized coefficients directly (standardize X and Y before regression or compute beta from unstandardized b using SD ratios) and then compute p-values from the fitted model—but don’t claim they come from the PDF.

## F. Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the paper

1) **Recreate the dependent variables exactly**
   - Model 1 DV: count of disliked genres among: *Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin music*.
   - Model 2 DV: count of disliked among the “12 remaining genres” (you must match Bryson’s genre list and the exact “dislike” coding thresholds).

2) **Use the correct GSS year and sample**
   - Paper: **GSS 1993**
   - Match Bryson’s inclusion rules; avoid unintended listwise deletion (or document it and reconcile N).

3) **Match predictor coding**
   - Racism score: same items, same direction, same scaling.
   - Education: same metric (years vs categories).
   - Income per capita: same construction (household income / household size, and any transformations).
   - Occupational prestige: same prestige scale and coding.
   - Race dummies: Black, Hispanic, Other (with White as reference).
   - Religion dummies: Conservative Protestant; No religion (with mainline/other as reference per paper).
   - Southern: same region definition.

4) **Report standardized coefficients**
   - Either:
     - standardize all variables (including DV) and run OLS; coefficients are standardized betas, or
     - compute beta = b_unstd * SD(X)/SD(Y).
   - Then format output exactly like Table 2: coefficient + stars only.

5) **Do not invent SEs from the table**
   - If you have microdata, fine—report SEs as *your* replication output, but then you’re no longer “matching Table 2 presentation.”
   - If you do not have microdata, omit SEs/p-values entirely.

6) **Add variable names to every row**
   - This is required to verify row alignment and prevents silent mislabeling.

If you paste the variable order you intended for the 11 rows in your generated tables (or the code that produced them), I can identify exactly which two predictors are missing and which rows are mis-mapped (e.g., Hispanic vs Southern vs prestige), rather than inferring from signs/magnitudes.
