Score: 20/100
============================================================

You have many mismatches. The “generated results” are **not reproducing Bryson (1996) Table 2** because (a) the *coefficients differ*, (b) the *sample sizes and constants/R² differ*, (c) at least one variable was **incorrectly dropped**, and (d) several **interpretations/significance markings** don’t match the printed table.

Below I list **every mismatch visible from what you provided** and then how to fix each so the generated analysis can match the “true results” table.

---

## 1) Model naming / mapping mismatch

### Mismatch
- **True Results**: “Model 1” = DV “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” (6 genres). “Model 2” = DV “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres.”
- **Generated Results**: calls these **Model 2A** (6 genres) and **Model 2B** (12 genres).

### Fix
- Rename your outputs to match the paper:
  - Model2A → **Model 1**
  - Model2B → **Model 2**
- This doesn’t change numbers, but it’s required for a correct comparison and interpretation.

---

## 2) Sample size (N) mismatch (major)

### Mismatch
- **True**: N=644 (Model 1) and N=605 (Model 2)
- **Generated**: N=257 for both models (in `combined_fit`)

This alone guarantees coefficients/constants/R² won’t match, because you are estimating on a much smaller and likely differently-filtered analytic sample.

### Fix
- Replicate **Bryson’s exact sample restrictions**:
  - Use the same survey year(s), inclusion rules, and missing-data handling.
  - Very likely: you are doing **listwise deletion on more variables** than Bryson, or you recoded “missing” more aggressively (see Section 4 and 5).
- Practical repair steps:
  1. Create the two DVs on the full target dataset/year.
  2. Apply only the exclusions Bryson applied (often: keep valid DV + valid predictors; but *how* missing is defined matters).
  3. Confirm N matches **644** and **605** before running any regression.
  4. If you must use listwise deletion, ensure your missing-value recodes match the paper’s (e.g., treat “DK/NA” as missing only when Bryson did).

---

## 3) R² / Adjusted R² mismatch

### Mismatch
- **True**:
  - Model 1: R²=0.145; Adj R²=0.129
  - Model 2: R²=0.147; Adj R²=0.130
- **Generated**:
  - Model 2A: R²=0.174; Adj R²=0.137
  - Model 2B: R²=0.149; Adj R²=0.111

These are inconsistent with the paper, and the N mismatch explains much of it (Adj R² is especially sensitive to N).

### Fix
- First fix N (Section 2).
- Ensure you are running **OLS on the same DV definitions** (counts of disliked genres; ensure identical coding thresholds for “dislike”).
- Ensure you are using **standard OLS with an intercept**, no weights unless Bryson used them (and if he did, you must match that).
- After N and coding match, R² should converge closely.

---

## 4) Constant/intercept mismatch (large; also suggests DV scaling differences)

### Mismatch
- **True**:
  - Model 1 constant: **2.415***  
  - Model 2 constant: **7.860** (note: no stars printed in what you pasted; in the article it may or may not be starred)
- **Generated**:
  - Model 2A constant: **2.663667*** (higher than true)
  - Model 2B constant: **5.356969*** (far lower than true)

### Fix
- Again, N mismatch is a big driver.
- Also strongly suggests your **DV construction** differs from Bryson’s:
  - Make sure the 12-genre DV truly has the same maximum and genre list as Bryson’s “remaining 12.”
  - Confirm “dislike” coding (e.g., “dislike” vs “like,” handling neutral, etc.).
- After DV and sample match, the constant should get close.

---

## 5) “No religion” incorrectly dropped (and should not be NaN)

### Mismatch
- **True**: “No religion” is included and has coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**
- **Generated**: `No religion (RELIG==4)` is **dropped (no variation)** and shown as NaN in both models.

This is a clear discrepancy in **variable construction and/or sample restriction**.

### Fix
- Your “no religion” dummy has no variation in the analytic sample because of how you filtered or recoded RELIG.
- Repair steps:
  1. Recode RELIG so that “no religion” category is correctly identified.
  2. Ensure you are not inadvertently setting RELIG==4 to missing (or filtering it out).
  3. After recoding, check `value_counts()` of `no_religion` **in the regression sample** before fitting. It must contain both 0 and 1.
- If Bryson used a different coding (e.g., “none” includes atheists/agnostics/none), match that exact category definition.

---

## 6) Variable name mismatches (labeling vs table names)

These are mostly cosmetic, but a couple are substantive because they reveal **proxy/derived variables** that may not match the paper.

### Mismatches and why they matter
- **Racism score**: generated label says “strict 5 items, sum (0–5).” Bryson’s “racism score” may be constructed similarly, but unless you replicate the *exact* items and missing rules, your coefficient will differ.
- **Conservative Protestant**: you used a **proxy** `RELIG==1 & DENOM==1`. That is unlikely to be identical to Bryson’s measure.
- **Hispanic**: you used a complicated rule from ETHNIC. Bryson’s coding may differ.
- Race categories: you coded Black as `RACE==2`, Other as `RACE==3`. Bryson’s “Other race” may not match that coding depending on the survey.

### Fix
- Replace proxies with the exact variables/definitions used in the paper (or as close as possible given the dataset):
  - Reconstruct “Conservative Protestant” using the same classification scheme Bryson used (often RELTRAD-style or denomination-based coding; the simple RELIG/DENOM conjunction is rarely equivalent).
  - Reconstruct Hispanic indicator using the same ethnicity/race scheme Bryson used.
  - Verify race codes against the original codebook for the dataset Bryson analyzed.
- Only after the predictors match will standardized coefficients align.

## 7) Coefficient mismatches (all predictors)

Below I compare **generated standardized betas** to the **true standardized coefficients** from Table 2. Every row listed differs unless noted.

### Model 1 (paper) vs Generated “Model 2A” (6 minority-linked genres)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.142* | **value + sig mismatch** (should be **, not *) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.253*** | **too negative** |
| Income pc | -0.037 | -0.0169 | **magnitude off** |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.0560 | **sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.0358 | **magnitude off** |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.1666** | **sig mismatch** (*** vs **) |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.174* | **magnitude + sig mismatch** |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.0578 | close numerically, **sig differs (none vs none)** OK |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.0074 | **sign wrong** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.063 | 0.1018 | **magnitude off** |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN (dropped) | **wrong (must be included)** |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.0569 | **sign wrong** |

### Model 2 (paper) vs Generated “Model 2B” (12 remaining genres)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.0069 | **sign wrong** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.1577* | **magnitude + sig mismatch** |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.0764 | somewhat close magnitude, sig in paper none; your sig none OK |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.0822 | **sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.0920 | magnitude off |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.1088 | **sig mismatch** (should be **) |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.0459 | close numerically |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.1023 | **too negative** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.1396* | **too large + sig mismatch** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.048 | 0.1235 | **too large** |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN (dropped) | **wrong (must be included)** |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.1047 | **too large** |

### Fix (for coefficient mismatches)
These are not small rounding issues; they indicate your model is not the same. To make coefficients match, you must align:

1. **Analytic N** (Section 2).
2. **Predictor constructions** (Section 6), especially:
   - racism scale (items + missing rules),
   - conservative Protestant classification,
   - race/ethnicity coding,
   - no religion not dropped.
3. **DV coding** (counts and which genres are in each set, and how “dislike” is defined).
4. **Standardization method**: Bryson’s are standardized OLS coefficients. In practice that means:
   - either standardize X and Y then run OLS, or
   - compute beta from unstandardized b using SD ratios.
   You must do it the same way and on the same sample (they’re equivalent if done correctly, but missing-data handling can create differences).

---

## 8) Standard errors reported / implied (should not be there)

### Mismatch
- **True**: Table 2 reports **no standard errors** (and you note that).
- **Generated**: you don’t show SEs, but your prompt asks to check SE mismatches—there are **no SEs** to compare. Also, your significance stars must be based on p-values from your regression, which will not match the paper unless the model matches exactly.

### Fix
- Do **not** present standard errors if you’re claiming to reproduce Table 2.
- If you must compute stars, be clear: “stars computed from our model p-values” unless you reproduce Bryson exactly.
- Best: output only standardized coefficients + stars to mirror Table 2.

---

## 9) Interpretation/significance mismatches

### Mismatch patterns
- Several predictors have different star levels (e.g., Racism and Age in Model 1; Education in Model 2).
- Some coefficients flip sign (prestige, southern, racism in Model 2), which would reverse interpretation.

### Fix
- After fixing coding and sample, re-check:
  - two-tailed tests
  - same alpha thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001)
- Ensure you’re not using robust SEs or clustering if Bryson did not (that changes p-values).
- Ensure you’re not using weights unless Bryson did.

---

## What you should change first (minimal path to matching)

1. **Stop dropping “no religion”**: fix RELIG coding + missing handling so it varies.
2. **Get N to match** (644 and 605). Do not proceed until it does.
3. **Rebuild Conservative Protestant** (your proxy is likely wrong).
4. **Verify DV construction** (genre lists + dislike threshold).
5. Re-run OLS and compute **standardized betas** the same way Bryson reports them.
6. Only then compare coefficients and stars.

If you share (a) your DV construction rules for “dislike,” (b) the exact racism items used and missing rule, and (c) how you created Conservative Protestant and the sample filters, I can point to the specific step most responsible for the N collapsing to 257 and the sign flips.
