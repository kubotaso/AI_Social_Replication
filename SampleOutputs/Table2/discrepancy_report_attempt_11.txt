Score: 20/100
============================================================

### 1) The generated output is not the same estimand as the “true” table (standardized-only), and it fabricates SEs/p-values
**True Table 2:** reports **standardized coefficients only** (with stars), **no standard errors**, and (implicitly) significance from the original author’s tests.  
**Generated tables:** include **unstandardized coefficients (`b_unstd`)**, **standardized betas (`beta_std`)**, and **exact p-values**.

**Mismatch**
- Any comparison of `b_unstd`, p-values, or SEs to Table 2 is invalid because Table 2 does not provide them.
- Even the standardized betas won’t match if the sample/coding differs (and it does—see below).

**Fix**
- To match the paper, output **only standardized coefficients** and significance stars, and **do not report SEs** unless you have the underlying microdata and re-estimate the model yourself.
- If you are re-estimating from microdata, then you *can* report SEs—but then you must label them as *replication estimates*, not “from Table 2”.

### 2) Sample size (N) is wrong in both models
**Generated**
- Model A: **N = 456**
- Model B: **N = 456**

**True**
- Model 1: **N = 644**
- Model 2: **N = 605**

**Mismatch**
- Very large N discrepancies will change coefficients, SEs, and significance.

**Fix**
- Use the **same dataset/year** as the paper (GSS 1993) and the same inclusion rules.
- Ensure you replicate the paper’s **missing-data handling** (likely listwise deletion, but must be checked).
- Ensure the DVs are constructed from the correct genre items and that all predictors exist and are coded as in the paper.

---

### 3) R² and adjusted R² do not match (and Model B is especially off)
**Generated**
- Model A: R² = **0.1403**, Adj R² = **0.1210**
- Model B: R² = **0.1214**, Adj R² = **0.1016**

**True**
- Model 1: R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**
- Model 2: R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**

**Mismatch**
- Model A is close-ish on R² but still off; Model B is materially lower.

**Fix**
- Once you correct **N**, DV construction, and predictor coding, refit and recompute.
- Make sure you are using **OLS** and the same set of predictors (including region, religion dummies, etc.).

---

### 4) Variable set / naming and ordering are not aligned, and one predictor is “dropped”
The generated tables provide **no variable names** per row (critical problem), and they report:
- `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: no_religion`

**True table includes**
- **Conservative Protestant**
- **No religion**
- plus other predictors, and explicitly reports a coefficient for “No religion” in both models.

**Mismatch**
- If `no_religion` is truly zero-variance in your data, you are not using the same sample/coding. In the paper, “No religion” varies and is estimated.

**Fix**
- Ensure `no_religion` is coded correctly (e.g., 1 = no religion, 0 = otherwise) and that your analytic sample actually contains both 0 and 1.
- If you used a restricted subset where everyone has the same religion category, undo that restriction.
- Output a coefficient table **with explicit row names matching the paper**.

---

### 5) Constants (intercepts) do not match
**Generated**
- Model A constant (`b_unstd` first row): **2.6818**
- Model B constant: **5.5768**

**True**
- Model 1 constant: **2.415***  
- Model 2 constant: **7.860** (no stars shown)

**Mismatch**
- Intercepts differ substantially, especially Model B.

**Fix**
- Correct the DV construction and sample selection first. Intercepts are extremely sensitive to DV scaling and which cases are included.

---

### 6) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas) across many predictors

Because your generated tables lack variable names per row, we can only compare where the *pattern* clearly conflicts with the paper. Below are the clear mismatches based on the true table’s expected standardized coefficients and the plausible mapping of your rows (the `beta_std` column is what should be compared to Table 2).

#### Model 1 (paper) vs generated ModelA_table (beta_std)
Paper Model 1 standardized coefficients:
- Racism **+0.130**
- Education **−0.175**
- Income **−0.037**
- Occ prestige **−0.020**
- Female **−0.057**
- Age **+0.163**
- Black **−0.132**
- Hispanic **−0.058**
- Other race **−0.017**
- Cons Prot **+0.063**
- No religion **+0.057**
- Southern **+0.024**

Generated Model A beta_std values (non-NaN):  
`0.124, -0.259, -0.051, 0.079, -0.010, 0.096, -0.149, 0.027, 0.077, 0.026`

**Mismatches (even under the “best” row alignment)**
- **Education**: generated around **−0.259** vs true **−0.175** (too negative).
- **Age**: true is **+0.163***, but the only clear positive medium beta you have is ~**+0.096** (too small). If your −0.051 were age, sign would be wrong.
- **Race dummies**: true Black is **−0.132***; you have **−0.149** (close-ish) but then other race effects in your table are **positive** (e.g., +0.027, +0.077), while the paper’s Hispanic and Other race are **negative** (−0.058, −0.017).
- **Religion/South**: paper has small positives (0.063, 0.057, 0.024). You have small positives (~0.026, ~0.077, ~0.027), but since `no_religion` is missing/dropped, you cannot match the paper’s structure.

**Fix**
- Add variable labels to each row and confirm mapping.
- Recode race categories and ensure the reference category matches the paper (likely White as reference, with Black/Hispanic/Other as dummies).
- Ensure the DV matches “dislike minority genres (6)” exactly.

#### Model 2 (paper) vs generated ModelB_table (beta_std)
Paper Model 2 standardized coefficients:
- Racism **+0.080** (ns)
- Education **−0.242***  
- Income **−0.065** (ns)
- Occ prestige **+0.005**
- Female **−0.070**
- Age **+0.126** **
- Black **+0.042**
- Hispanic **−0.029**
- Other race **+0.047**
- Cons Prot **+0.048**
- No religion **+0.024**
- Southern **+0.069**

Generated Model B beta_std values (non-NaN):  
`-0.015, -0.219, -0.050, -0.022, -0.070, 0.055, 0.033, 0.068, 0.114, 0.122`

**Mismatches**
- **Racism score sign**: paper **+0.080**, generated has a small **negative** beta (−0.015) for one predictor—if that row is racism, the sign is wrong.
- **Age**: paper **+0.126**, generated has only **+0.055** (too small) if that corresponds to age.
- **Southern**: paper **+0.069**, you do have a **+0.068** which could match, but without names it’s guesswork.
- **No religion**: should be included (+0.024), but you report it as dropped.

**Fix**
- Confirm the racism scale construction and direction (higher = more racist?) matches Bryson.
- Ensure the DV is “dislike 12 remaining genres” (not “other12” built differently).
- Keep `no_religion` in the model by fixing coding/sample.

---

### 7) Significance markers don’t match the paper and are driven by your (non-matching) p-values
Example issues:
- In the paper, **racism is significant in Model 1 (0.130\*\*)** but **not significant in Model 2 (0.080)**.
- Your generated Model A shows a significant positive beta around 0.124 (*), which is close but the star level might not match; your Model B shows one positive beta 0.114 with p=0.0167 (starred), which could incorrectly imply racism is significant if that row is racism.

**Fix**
- Once the model is correctly replicated (same N, same coding), compute p-values from the replication and then apply the same star cutoffs.  
- If you are trying to match the *published* stars exactly, you need the exact same sample and specification; otherwise label stars as “replication-based”.

## Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Rebuild the dependent variables exactly as Bryson (1996):**
   - Model 1 DV: number of disliked among **Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin** (and confirm how “dislike” is coded).
   - Model 2 DV: number of disliked among the **other 12** genres.
   - Ensure the counts and missing rules match (e.g., require non-missing for all genre items included in the count).

2. **Use the correct dataset and sample definition:**
   - GSS **1993**, and match the paper’s inclusion criteria.
   - Replicate listwise deletion across all model variables to recover **N=644** and **N=605** (or understand why you cannot).

3. **Match predictor coding and reference categories:**
   - Racism scale: confirm item set, scaling, and direction.
   - Race dummies: White as reference; Black/Hispanic/Other as in table.
   - Religion categories: correctly generate **Conservative Protestant** and **No religion** indicators.
   - “Southern” coding consistent with the paper.

4. **Report the same quantities:**
   - Output **standardized coefficients** (beta) for all predictors.
   - Do **not** report SEs “from the table” because they are not there.
   - Add row labels identical to the paper’s variable names.

5. **Quality control checks before comparing:**
   - Verify each predictor has the same mean/SD (or close) as in GSS 1993 for the analytic sample.
   - Verify `no_religion` has variance and is not inadvertently constant due to filtering.

If you paste the generated tables again **with the row variable names** (or the model formula / design matrix column order), I can produce a line-by-line mismatch list (variable-by-variable) instead of the partial mapping that’s possible from the current unlabeled rows.
