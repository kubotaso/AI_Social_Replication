============================================================

### 1) Table of coefficients (“table2_betas”) is essentially unusable vs. the true Table 2

#### Mismatch: coefficients are all `NaN`
- **Generated:** Every entry in `ModelA_Std_Beta` and `ModelB_Std_Beta` is `NaN`, while significance stars appear in some rows.
- **True:** Table 2 reports **actual standardized coefficients** for 12 predictors in each model (plus constant).

**How to fix**
- You need to actually compute or populate standardized OLS coefficients (beta weights). In practice:
  - Fit OLS on the **same DV definitions** and **same sample** as Bryson.
  - Either (a) standardize all X’s and Y (z-scores) before OLS, or (b) convert unstandardized b’s to standardized betas via:  
    \[
    \beta_j = b_j \times \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
    \]
- Then write those betas into the table instead of NaN. Also ensure row alignment matches variable names (see below).

#### Mismatch: variable names are missing / not shown / not aligned
- **Generated:** `table2_betas` shows **no variable-name column**, only two beta columns and two significance columns, so we cannot map rows to predictors. Given the stars pattern, it also looks like the rows are not aligned to the true ordering.
- **True:** The rows are explicitly:
  1) Racism score  
  2) Education  
  3) Household income per capita  
  4) Occupational prestige  
  5) Female  
  6) Age  
  7) Black  
  8) Hispanic  
  9) Other race  
  10) Conservative Protestant  
  11) No religion  
  12) Southern  
  (plus Constant, R², Adj R², N separately)

**How to fix**
- Include an explicit `Independent Variable` column and enforce exact ordering and naming as in the paper.
- Make sure the model includes **exactly** those predictors (and not extra controls / different codings).
- Ensure your pipeline doesn’t drop labels when pivoting/widening.

#### Mismatch: significance stars don’t correspond to any coefficients
- **Generated:** Stars appear (e.g., `**`, `***`, `*`) even though the coefficient is NaN.
- **True:** Stars are attached to specific coefficients (e.g., racism score 0.130** in Model 1).

**How to fix**
- Only generate significance indicators from actual model statistics (p-values), and only after coefficients exist.
- Or, if you are *reproducing the printed table* rather than estimating anew, copy the stars exactly with the coefficients from the paper.

### 2) Model fit block (“fit”) is wrong on N, R², adjusted R², and constants

#### Mismatch: N is far too small
- **Generated:** Model A N=340, Model B N=326
- **True:** Model 1 N=644, Model 2 N=605

**How to fix**
- Your analytic dataset is being heavily reduced—likely due to:
  - listwise deletion across many music items or racism items,
  - incorrectly requiring complete cases for both DVs simultaneously,
  - or using a different survey wave/subsample.
- To match Bryson:
  - Construct **DV1 and DV2 exactly as Bryson defines** (see Section 3) and then allow cases with nonmissing DV for that model.
  - Recreate the same missing-data handling (likely listwise on variables in that model, but with far fewer missing values than you currently have).
  - Check that you are using the same source sample and weighting rules as the paper (if any). If you are using a different dataset extract, you won’t hit N=644/605.

#### Mismatch: R² and adjusted R² do not match
- **Generated:** R² = 0.2049 (Model A), 0.1674 (Model B); Adj R² = 0.1808, 0.1410
- **True:** R² = 0.145 (Model 1), 0.147 (Model 2); Adj R² = 0.129, 0.130

**How to fix**
- Once you:
  1) use the same N / sample,
  2) use the same DV construction,
  3) use the same predictor coding,
  the R² should move toward the printed values.
- Also ensure you are reporting **OLS R²**, not something else (e.g., weighted R², pseudo-R², or R² after standardization mishandling).

#### Mismatch: constants are wrong
- **Generated:** Constant = 2.656845*** (Model A), 5.205438*** (Model B)
- **True:** Constant = 2.415*** (Model 1), 7.860 (Model 2; notably printed with no stars)

**How to fix**
- Constants depend on **DV scale and coding** and on whether the model is estimated on raw or standardized variables.
- Important: Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients**, but it still prints a **constant on the original DV scale** in the paper. If you standardized Y, your intercept should be ~0, which you do *not* have—so you’re in a mixed/incorrect state.
- Action items:
  - Estimate the model on the **original DV scale** (for intercept comparability).
  - Compute standardized coefficients separately (post-hoc beta conversion) while retaining the unstandardized intercept.
  - Verify DV2 range/mean (your DV2 descriptives look inconsistent with Bryson’s “12 remaining genres” scale; see next section).

---

### 3) DV descriptives strongly suggest your dependent variables do not match Bryson’s

#### Mismatch: DV names differ (and imply different construction)
- **Generated DV names:**  
  - `dv1_dislike_minority_linked_6`  
  - `dv2_dislike_remaining_12`
- **True DV labels:**  
  - “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” (6 genres)  
  - “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres” (12 genres)

Your DV names *sound* similar, but the descriptives raise red flags.

#### Mismatch: DV2 maximum is 12, which is implausible for a 12-item summed dislike index unless items are binary
- **Generated DV2:** min 0, max 12, mean 3.78
- If each of 12 genres is scored, typical “dislike” measures in GSS music batteries are often **1–5** (or similar) per genre; then a sum would range far above 12 (e.g., 12 to 60, or 0 to 48 if recoded).
- The printed constant for Model 2 is **7.860**, which is consistent with a scale that can reach at least that high, but doesn’t prove binary vs. multi-point. However, your DV2 max=12 strongly suggests you recoded each genre to **0/1 dislike** and summed.

**How to fix**
- Re-check Bryson’s measurement:
  - Did Bryson code “dislike” as a binary indicator (1=dislike, 0=not dislike) for each genre? If not, your DV is wrong.
  - If the original is ordinal (e.g., 1=like a lot … 5=dislike a lot), match the paper’s recode rules exactly (e.g., count “dislike” and “dislike a lot” as 1, else 0—*if* that’s what Bryson did).
- Ensure the 6 “minority-linked” genres are exactly the ones listed (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin). Your variable name “minority_linked_6” doesn’t guarantee you used the exact same set.

#### Mismatch: DV1 count shown as 1134 is not N
- **Generated `dv_descriptives`:** first row is 1134 and 1057, which looks like **non-missing count**, but your model N is 340/326.
- That indicates you have much more DV data than you use in regression—pointing to listwise deletion due to X’s (racism items, income, prestige, etc.) or an unintended merge/filter.

**How to fix**
- Compute N for each regression as the count of rows with nonmissing DV and all model covariates. Then identify which covariates drive the drop from ~1100 to ~340 using a missingness-by-variable table restricted to the regression variables.

### 4) Missingness outputs are inconsistent with “matching Bryson” and suggest coding/processing errors

#### Mismatch: “missingness_modelA/B” shows extreme missing shares
- **Generated:** missing shares like 0.476, 0.363, 0.294/0.342, etc.
- If nearly half your cases are missing on key variables, that would explain your very low N—but it likely does not reflect the paper’s analytic sample sizes (644/605).

**How to fix**
- Create a table that maps each missingness row to a specific variable name (right now it’s unlabeled, like your betas table).
- Then:
  - verify recodes didn’t convert valid codes to NA (e.g., treating “Don’t know”, “Not asked”, or “Inapplicable” incorrectly),
  - verify merges didn’t create systematic missingness (join keys mismatched),
  - consider multiple imputation only if the paper did (but Bryson’s printed table suggests conventional complete-case OLS).

#### Mismatch: item_missingness_music has `NaN` in cells
- **Generated:** many `NaN` entries alternating between the two columns.
- That looks like a *computation artifact* (e.g., dividing by zero, or storing missingness only for one group and leaving the other as NaN).

**How to fix**
- Ensure missingness shares are computed as numeric proportions for every item, for both sets, and that you’re not accidentally subsetting items so that one column has no corresponding rows.
- Replace NaN with 0 only if it truly means “no missing”; otherwise fix the calculation so it returns a real proportion.

### 5) Interpretation/significance: generated output cannot match because it lacks the true coefficients

#### Mismatch: you can’t reproduce Bryson’s interpretation without matching signs/magnitudes
The true results include key patterns that should appear in your generated table:
- Model 1: Racism positive (0.130**), Education negative (-0.175***), Age positive (0.163***), Black negative (-0.132***).
- Model 2: Education more negative (-0.242***), Age positive (0.126**), Racism smaller and NS (0.080).

**How to fix**
- Once coefficients are correctly computed and displayed (not NaN), verify:
  - variable codings (e.g., higher racism score = more racist? education higher=more schooling?),
  - reference categories for race and religion,
  - consistent standardization method (standardize continuous variables; for binaries, beta is still computable but depends on SD).

## Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the true Table 2

1) **Rebuild DV1 and DV2 exactly** as in Bryson (same genre list, same dislike coding, same aggregation).
2) **Use the correct sample** (same survey/year/module; same inclusion criteria).
3) **Recode predictors identically** (race dummies, religion categories, South, education, income per capita, prestige, racism scale direction).
4) **Run OLS on the unstandardized DV** and store the intercept.
5) **Compute standardized coefficients** (beta) post-estimation and report them (no standard errors, per the note).
6) **Attach significance stars** based on p-values from the OLS model (two-tailed thresholds matching the note).
7) **Fix tables to include variable names** and ensure row order matches the paper.
8) **Diagnose the N collapse** by listing missingness for exactly the model variables, with labels, and fix the recode/merge steps causing massive missingness.

If you paste (a) the code that constructs DV1/DV2 and (b) the variable list used in Model A/B, I can pinpoint exactly which variable(s) are causing the N drop and which DV coding is producing the 0–12 range.
