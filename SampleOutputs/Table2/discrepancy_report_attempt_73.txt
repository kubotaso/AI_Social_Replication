Score: 44/100
============================================================

Below is a variable-by-variable audit of what the **generated results** report versus what **Table 2 (Bryson 1996)** actually reports, plus concrete steps to fix the generated analysis so it matches the published table.

---

## 0) Structural/reporting mismatches (before coefficients)

### A. Wrong sample sizes (N)
- **Model 1**
  - Generated: **N = 549**
  - True: **N = 644**
  - **Fix:** Use the same dataset/wave and the same inclusion rules as Bryson (1996). Your pipeline is dropping many more observations (likely due to listwise deletion and/or missing handling for income/prestige/religion/region/race). You must replicate Bryson’s missing-data handling and variable construction.

- **Model 2**
  - Generated: **N = 507**
  - True: **N = 605**
  - **Fix:** Same as above; confirm the DV construction and missingness. Model 2 is losing ~98 cases vs. the paper.

### B. Wrong fit statistics (R² and Adjusted R²)
- **Model 1**
  - Generated: R² **0.133**; Adj R² **0.115**
  - True: R² **0.145**; Adj R² **0.129**
- **Model 2**
  - Generated: R² **0.120**; Adj R² **0.100**
  - True: R² **0.147**; Adj R² **0.130**
- **Fix:** Once you match (i) the analytic sample, (ii) the DV construction, and (iii) the coding of race categories and other covariates, the R² should move into line. If not, you’re not running the same model.

### C. “Standard errors” are a required comparison—but none are provided anywhere
- The user request asks to compare **standard errors**, but:
  - Generated tables show **only standardized beta and stars** (no SE).
  - True table **explicitly does not report SE**.
- **Fix options:**
  1. **Remove SE from the comparison criteria** and state “SE not available in the published table; cannot be validated.”
  2. If you computed SEs anyway, you can report them, but you **cannot** claim they match Table 2 because the paper doesn’t provide them.

### D. Hispanic is mishandled in the generated output
- Generated: Hispanic beta = **NaN** in both models; fit_stats says it was “Dropped_all_missing hispanic”
- True: Hispanic is included with coefficients **-0.058 (M1)** and **-0.029 (M2)**.
- **Fix:** Your `hispanic` variable is either entirely missing, incorrectly merged, or incorrectly recoded to missing for all observations. You must:
  - Recreate the race/ethnicity coding exactly as in Bryson.
  - Ensure “Hispanic” is a dummy category (and not a separate ethnicity variable that you accidentally used to filter/NA out).

### E. Constant is mishandled
- Generated tables show Constant beta = **NaN** (but fit_stats reports constants 2.461 and 4.958)
- True constants: **2.415*** (M1) and **7.860** (M2).
- **Fix:** You are mixing concepts:
  - Table columns labeled “Standardized beta” should **not** contain a standardized coefficient for the intercept (many software packages don’t standardize the intercept).
  - But you still must report the **unstandardized intercept** if you want to match the paper.
  - Also, your Model 2 intercept is wildly off (4.96 vs 7.86), indicating DV scaling/coding differences (see below).

## 1) Model 1: coefficient/significance mismatches (variable-by-variable)

True Model 1 coefficients (Bryson) vs generated:

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.131833** ** | **0.130** ** | close (ok) |
| Education | **-0.180139*** | **-0.175*** | slightly off |
| Household income per capita | **0.008961** | **-0.037** | **wrong sign & magnitude** |
| Occupational prestige | **-0.019019** | **-0.020** | close (ok) |
| Female | **-0.071658** | **-0.057** | off |
| Age | **0.156851*** | **0.163*** | slightly off |
| Black | **-0.141030** ** | **-0.132*** | **stars differ** (**, not ***) and value off |
| Hispanic | **NaN** | **-0.058** | **missing entirely** |
| Other race | **0.010867** | **-0.017** | **wrong sign** |
| Conservative Protestant | **0.083766** | **0.063** | off |
| No religion | **0.068263** | **0.057** | off |
| Southern | **0.026711** | **0.024** | close (ok) |
| Constant | **NaN** (but ~2.461 elsewhere) | **2.415*** | missing in table + value off + stars missing |

### Interpretation mismatches implied by these
- Your generated Model 1 implies **income increases dislike** (positive beta), while Bryson shows **income decreases dislike** (negative beta).
- Your generated Model 1 implies **“Other race” increases dislike** (positive), while Bryson shows **decreases dislike** (negative).
- You fail to estimate Hispanic at all, which changes the baseline and likely affects race coefficients and N.

### How to fix Model 1 to match
1. **Rebuild the race dummies** exactly:
   - White is the reference (implicit).
   - Include **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race** as separate dummy variables.
   - Do not drop “Hispanic” as all-missing; diagnose why it is all NA.
2. **Recreate Household income per capita**:
   - Your income values look plausible, but the sign mismatch suggests either:
     - you used the wrong income measure (e.g., household income *level* not *per capita*), or
     - you reversed the DV or one of the components, or
     - you applied standardization incorrectly (e.g., standardized the DV differently or used weights inconsistently).
3. **Use the same weighting strategy (if any)** as the paper:
   - If Bryson used survey weights and you didn’t (or vice versa), standardized betas and significance stars can change.
4. **Match the analytic sample (N=644)**:
   - Don’t do stricter listwise deletion than the original.
   - If you must use listwise deletion, make sure you’re using the same missing codes and recodes (e.g., 8/9/98/99 to missing).

## 2) Model 2: coefficient/significance mismatches (variable-by-variable)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **-0.002233** | **0.080** | **wrong sign & huge discrepancy** |
| Education | **-0.194316*** | **-0.242*** | too small (attenuated) |
| Household income per capita | **-0.035654** | **-0.065** | too small |
| Occupational prestige | **-0.012431** | **0.005** | sign mismatch |
| Female | **-0.069205** | **-0.070** | close (ok) |
| Age | **0.119317** ** | **0.126** ** | close (ok) |
| Black | **0.066914** | **0.042** | off |
| Hispanic | **NaN** | **-0.029** | missing entirely |
| Other race | **0.076128** | **0.047** | off |
| Conservative Protestant | **0.101269** * | **0.048** | magnitude + stars mismatch (you mark significant; Bryson does not) |
| No religion | **0.018895** | **0.024** | slightly off |
| Southern | **0.075385** | **0.069** | close (ok) |
| Constant | **NaN** (but ~4.958 elsewhere) | **7.860** | wrong and missing in table |

### Interpretation mismatches implied by these
- The biggest substantive error: generated Model 2 says racism has **~0 effect and slightly negative**, while Bryson shows racism is **positive (0.080)** (though not starred).
- Generated Model 2 also incorrectly concludes Conservative Protestant is significant (*), while the published table reports it as non-significant (no star).

### How to fix Model 2 to match
1. **Fix DV construction for “12 remaining genres”**
   - Your Model 2 intercept is far too low (4.96 vs 7.86), strongly suggesting your DV scale is not the same as Bryson’s.
   - Verify:
     - which genres are included in the “remaining 12”
     - how “dislike” is coded (direction, range, treatment of “don’t know,” etc.)
     - whether the DV is a sum, mean, factor score, or count. Your sample rows show values like 10, 12, etc., which look like a **count/sum**, but you must confirm the exact scoring.
2. **Fix the Hispanic dummy** (same issue as Model 1).
3. **Re-check standardization method for betas**
   - Bryson reports *standardized OLS coefficients*. Ensure you replicate the same:
     - Standardize X and Y using the analytic sample used in the model.
     - Use the same weights (or none).
     - Don’t standardize after imputing missing differently.
4. **Confirm the racism scale is computed the same way**
   - A near-zero racism coefficient in Model 2 often comes from:
     - using a different racism index (different items or reverse-coding errors),
     - or accidentally centering/standardizing with a different sample or with missing coded as 0.

## 3) Significance-star mismatches

Even where coefficients are “close,” your **stars** often do not match because:
- N is wrong (smaller N → larger SE → fewer stars, or vice versa),
- you may be using different p-value thresholds/two-tailed vs one-tailed,
- you may be using robust SEs, clustering, or weights changing SEs.

Concrete mismatches:
- **Model 1 Black**: Generated ** (true ***)
- **Model 2 Conservative Protestant**: Generated * (true none)

**Fix:** After matching the sample and coding, compute p-values in the same way Bryson did (likely conventional OLS, two-tailed). If the paper used weighted OLS and design-based SEs, replicate that.

---

## 4) Variable-name / specification mismatches

### A. Variable list in generated sample doesn’t include “hispanic”
- Your analytic sample tables show columns: `black`, `other_race` but **not** `hispanic`.
- Yet your regression tables list “Hispanic” with NaN.
- **Fix:** Ensure the model matrix actually includes the Hispanic dummy column and it is not all-missing and not excluded during preprocessing.

### B. “Standardized beta” label is inconsistent with reporting intercept
- You can’t put intercept under “standardized beta” (it will be undefined/NaN).
- **Fix:** Separate intercept into its own “Constant (unstandardized)” column (as Bryson effectively does).

---

## 5) Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1. **Reconstruct both DVs exactly** (genre lists, coding of dislike, aggregation method, range).
2. **Reconstruct race/ethnicity exactly** so Hispanic is present and non-missing.
3. **Use the same sample rules** (missing codes, listwise deletion rules, weights).
4. **Run OLS with the same predictors** (no extra controls, same reference groups).
5. **Report standardized coefficients for predictors only**, and **unstandardized intercept separately**.
6. **Do not claim SE matching**—the published table does not provide SEs.

If you share the code/pseudocode you used to (i) build the two DVs and (ii) code race/ethnicity and income per capita, I can point to the specific lines that most likely created the income sign flip, the missing Hispanic dummy, and the Model 2 intercept/racism discrepancy.
