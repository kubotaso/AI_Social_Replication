### 1) Sample size and fit statistics mismatches (major)

**Model 1 (Generated “ModelA”)**
- **N mismatch:** Generated **419** vs True **644**
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.1587** vs True **0.145**
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.1381** vs True **0.129**

**Model 2 (Generated “ModelB”)**
- **N mismatch:** Generated **412** vs True **605**
- **R² mismatch:** Generated **0.1661** vs True **0.147**
- **Adj. R² mismatch:** Generated **0.1453** vs True **0.130**

**How to fix**
- Ensure you are using the **same dataset and wave** as the paper: **GSS 1993**, and the **same construction of the DV(s)** (see section 4).
- Replicate the paper’s **case inclusion / missing-data handling**. Your N is dramatically lower, implying you likely did **listwise deletion across more variables** than Bryson did, used different missing codes, or restricted the sample (e.g., only respondents with complete music-module responses).
- Recompute Model 1 and Model 2 after matching:
  - exact **genre availability** in 1993,
  - exact **coding** of race/ethnicity and religion,
  - exact **income per capita** construction,
  - exact **DV definitions** (6 minority-linked genres vs “12 remaining”).

### 2) Variable-name / variable-presence mismatches

**(a) Missing “Hispanic” in generated tables**
- **True Table 2 includes:** **Hispanic** (Model 1: -0.058; Model 2: -0.029)
- **Generated tables:** no “Hispanic” row at all.

**How to fix**
- Add the **Hispanic** indicator variable and ensure the race/ethnicity dummies match the paper’s reference category (likely **White, non-Hispanic** as omitted).
- If your data encodes Hispanic as part of race or as a separate ethnicity, you must match Bryson’s approach (race dummies + separate Hispanic dummy).

**(b) “No religion” is present but results are NaN**
- **Generated:** “No religion” shows **NaN** (no coefficient)
- **True:** “No religion” has coefficients (**0.057** in Model 1; **0.024** in Model 2)

**How to fix**
- This is almost always due to **perfect multicollinearity** or a **dropped factor level**:
  - You may have included a full set of religion dummies plus an intercept (dummy trap), or “No religion” is entirely missing after filtering.
- Remedy:
  - Make religion a factor and use a **clear reference category** (e.g., Mainline Protestant or Catholic—whatever the paper used; if unknown, at least ensure *one* category is omitted).
  - Confirm “No religion” has non-missing observations in the analytic sample.

**(c) “Other race” sign differs in Model 1**
- **Generated ModelA:** Other race **+0.026**
- **True Model 1:** Other race **-0.017**

**How to fix**
- Likely caused by (i) missing **Hispanic** control, (ii) different sample, or (iii) different coding of race categories.
- Implement race/ethnicity exactly as in the paper (White omitted; dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other).

### 3) Coefficient and significance mismatches (by model)

#### Model 1 (Generated ModelA vs True Model 1)

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.146** | 0.130** | magnitude differs | match DV construction + sample + standardization method |
| Education | -0.261*** | -0.175*** | too large in magnitude | same as above; also check education coding (years vs degree categories) |
| Income pc | -0.020 | -0.037 | too small | check income-per-capita construction and scaling |
| Occ prestige | +0.056 | -0.020 | **sign flips** | likely variable mismatch (wrong prestige measure) or sample/DV mismatch |
| Female | -0.008 | -0.057 | much closer to 0 | check female coding and sample; also DV mismatch |
| Age | 0.109* | 0.163*** | smaller and different sig | check age coding (years vs categories), sample size, DV |
| Black | -0.163** | -0.132*** | magnitude differs; sig differs (** vs ***) | sample/SE differences; also check Black coding |
| Other race | +0.026 | -0.017 | **sign flip** | add Hispanic control + correct race coding |
| Cons Protestant | 0.078 | 0.063 | close | mostly fine once sample fixed |
| No religion | NaN | 0.057 | dropped | fix collinearity / missingness |
| Southern | 0.009 | 0.024 | smaller | sample/DV mismatch |
| Constant | 2.713*** | 2.415*** | differs | intercept depends on unstandardized model + DV definition |

Key interpretation mismatch in your generated notes:
- You claim: “Std betas from OLS on z-scored variables; intercept from unstandardized OLS…”
- The paper reports “standardized OLS coefficients” and a constant; but your approach (z-scoring DV and IVs) will generally **not reproduce the paper’s constant**, and it may not reproduce standardized coefficients if the paper standardized differently or computed betas post-estimation.

**Fix for standardization**
- To match standardized coefficients from a conventional OLS:
  - Fit the model on **raw variables** (unstandardized).
  - Compute standardized betas as: \(\beta_j = b_j \times \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}\).
  - Keep the intercept from the unstandardized model.
- Do **not** z-score everything and then mix intercepts from a different model if your goal is to match a published table.

#### Model 2 (Generated ModelB vs True Model 2)

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.009 | 0.080 | near-zero vs positive | DV definition mismatch and/or racism scale mismatch |
| Education | -0.227*** | -0.242*** | close | likely ok once sample fixed |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.065 | matches | ok |
| Occ prestige | -0.046 | +0.005 | **sign flip** | prestige measure mismatch or DV mismatch |
| Female | -0.078 | -0.070 | close | ok |
| Age | 0.042 | 0.126** | much smaller | DV mismatch and/or age coding/sample |
| Black | 0.102* | 0.042 | too large + wrong significance | sample/coding mismatch |
| Other race | 0.103* | 0.047 | too large + wrong sig | sample/coding mismatch |
| Cons Protestant | 0.106* | 0.048 | too large + wrong sig | sample/coding mismatch |
| No religion | NaN | 0.024 | dropped | collinearity/missingness |
| Southern | 0.144** | 0.069 | ~2× too large | DV/sample mismatch |
| Constant | 5.898*** | 7.860 (no stars reported) | wrong magnitude and significance | intercept/SE/sample mismatch |

### 4) Likely DV construction mismatches (the biggest substantive source)

The true models are defined by **two specific dislike indices**:

- **Model 1 DV:** number of disliked genres among **Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin**
- **Model 2 DV:** number of disliked genres among the **remaining 12 genres**

Your generated model names (“dislike_minority6”, “dislike_other12”) suggest you attempted this, but the coefficient pattern (especially racism and age in Model 2) strongly suggests your DV(s) are not constructed the same way (or not from the same available genre list in 1993).

**How to fix**
- Verify the **exact list of genres** in the 1993 GSS music module and ensure your “remaining 12” is exactly Bryson’s “12 remaining” (not 11 or 13 due to missing/renamed genres).
- Confirm how “dislike” is coded (e.g., “dislike” vs “like” vs “don’t know”):
  - Bryson likely treated “don’t know/never heard” differently than “neither like nor dislike.”
- Ensure the DV is a **count** with the same range as in the paper. If you recoded missing/neutral responses differently, coefficients will shift.

### 5) Standard errors: generated output implies SE-based inference, but the true table does not provide SEs

You were asked to compare SEs too, but:

- **True Table 2**: **no standard errors are reported**.
- **Generated tables**: also do **not show SEs**, but you do show **stars** “from model p-values.”

**Mismatch**
- Any claim that your stars match the paper’s stars must be treated cautiously because your p-values depend on:
  - your (different) N,
  - your model specification and coding,
  - your missing-data handling,
  - possibly different robust vs classical SEs.

**How to fix**
- Don’t present SE comparisons because the paper table doesn’t allow it.
- To match the paper’s stars as closely as possible:
  - replicate **N** and specification first;
  - use **two-tailed tests** with the same thresholds (*, **, *** as given);
  - use the same SE type as the paper (likely conventional OLS SEs unless stated otherwise).

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatches to correct in the write-up

- Your generated note says coefficients are “from OLS on z-scored variables.” That’s not the safest way to reproduce a published “standardized OLS coefficients” table (and it breaks interpretability of the constant).
- Also, Model 2 racism effect in the true results is **0.080 (ns)**; your generated is **0.009**, which would materially change the interpretation (it makes racism look irrelevant rather than small-to-moderate but nonsignificant).

**Fix**
- Rewrite interpretations after re-estimation with the correct sample and DV. Don’t interpret direction/significance until the replication matches Table 2’s coefficient pattern.

---

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. Use **GSS 1993** and confirm the **music module** items match Bryson’s genre list.
2. Construct the two DVs exactly as Bryson:
   - count disliked among the specified 6 (Model 1),
   - count disliked among the other 12 (Model 2),
   - handle DK/NA exactly as in the paper.
3. Recode covariates to match:
   - race dummies: **Black, Hispanic, Other** (White non-Hispanic omitted),
   - religion dummies include **Conservative Protestant** and **No religion** with a clear reference category,
   - prestige measure identical to Bryson’s (and direction verified).
4. Fit OLS on **unstandardized variables**, then compute standardized betas via \(b \cdot SD(X)/SD(Y)\).
5. Confirm N matches (**644** and **605**) before comparing coefficients/stars.

If you share the code (or at least the variable coding decisions for DV, racism scale, race/ethnicity, religion, prestige, and missing handling), I can point to the exact line(s) causing each mismatch.
