Score: 43/100
============================================================

Below is a variable-by-variable audit of what your **Generated Results** report versus the **True Results (Bryson 1996, Table 2)**, plus concrete fixes to make the generated output match the table.

---

## 1) Global / structural mismatches

### A. Wrong model numbering / labels
- **Generated:** “Model A (Minority-linked genres: 6)” and “Model B (Remaining genres: 12)”
- **True:** “Model 1” and “Model 2” with those same DVs.

**Fix:** Rename Model A → **Model 1**; Model B → **Model 2** (or explicitly state equivalence).

---

### B. Wrong sample sizes (N)
- **Generated:** Model A **N=549**; Model B **N=507**
- **True:** Model 1 **N=644**; Model 2 **N=605**

**Fix:** Your analytic samples are not the same as Bryson’s. To match:
1. Use the same dataset and year(s) Bryson used.
2. Replicate Bryson’s **case inclusion rules** (listwise deletion vs. specific missing-data handling).
3. Replicate construction of the DV counts and all predictors.
4. Ensure you are not accidentally dropping cases due to recodes (e.g., Hispanic “no variation” issue—see below).

---

### C. R² and Adjusted R² don’t match
- **Generated:**  
  - Model A R² **0.1330**, Adj R² **0.1153**  
  - Model B R² **0.1200**, Adj R² **0.1005**
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R² **0.145**, Adj R² **0.129**  
  - Model 2 R² **0.147**, Adj R² **0.130**

**Fix:** Once you correct the sample (N) and the exact variable construction, R² should move substantially toward the published values.

---

### D. You are mixing “standardized betas” with unstandardized intercepts without clarity
- **Generated tables:** show **Std_Beta** but also list a “Constant_unstd”.
- **True table:** shows standardized coefficients for predictors, but the constant is shown as a raw number in the table (Bryson prints it; predictors are standardized). This is common, but you must be explicit.

**Fix:** In your table output, label clearly:
- Predictors: **Standardized OLS coefficients (β)**
- Constant: **Unstandardized intercept** (and don’t label it “Std_Beta = NaN”)

---

### E. “Hispanic dropped (no variation)” is flatly inconsistent with the true model
- **Generated:** Hispanic is **dropped (no variation)** in both models.
- **True:** Hispanic has coefficients in both models (**-0.058** and **-0.029**).

**Fix:** This indicates a coding or subsetting error. Likely causes:
1. You filtered the dataset to a subgroup where `hispanic` is all 0 (or all 1).
2. You recoded Hispanic incorrectly (e.g., turned missing into 0 and then filtered to complete cases in a way that wiped variation).
3. You created mutually exclusive race dummies incorrectly (e.g., “black”, “other_race” defined, but “hispanic” overwritten or made dependent).

Concrete correction:
- Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies from the original race/ethnicity variable(s):
  - `black = 1 if race==Black`
  - `hispanic = 1 if ethnicity==Hispanic` (or if Bryson used “Hispanic” as race category, replicate that)
  - `other_race = 1 if race not White/Black/Hispanic`
  - Reference category should be **White non-Hispanic** (or whatever Bryson used—verify).
- Verify variation before modeling: `tab hispanic` (or `value_counts()`), overall and within the modeling sample.

---

## 2) Variable name mismatches

### A. Age variable naming
- **Generated:** uses `age_years` in samples but labels output as **Age**
- **True:** **Age**

**Fix:** Either rename consistently (Age everywhere) or note that `age_years` corresponds to Table 2’s Age.

### B. DV names
- **Generated DVs:** `dv1_minority6` and `dv2_remaining12`
- **True DV wording:** “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” and “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”

**Fix:** Rename DVs in printed output to match the paper titles (fine to keep internal variable names).

---

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 1 / Generated “Model A”)

True Model 1 coefficients vs Generated Model A “Std_Beta”:

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.131833** | close (ok) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.180139*** | slightly too negative |
| Household income per capita | -0.037 | **0.008961** | **wrong sign** and magnitude |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | -0.019019 | close (ok) |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.071658 | too negative |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.156851*** | slightly low |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.141030** | significance level wrong (*should be ***, not **) and magnitude off |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | **dropped** | **missing** |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.010867 | **wrong sign** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.083766 | too high |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.068263 | somewhat high |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.026711 | close (ok) |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.461148 (p shown) | intercept differs |

**Fixes to align Model 1:**
1. **Restore Hispanic variation** (major fix).
2. **Recompute income_pc exactly** as Bryson did. Your sign flip is a red flag that:
   - you used a different income measure (raw vs logged vs per-capita vs categories),
   - you standardized differently, or
   - you reversed coding (e.g., higher values = lower income).
3. **Other race sign mismatch** suggests your race coding/reference differs from Bryson’s. Ensure the same reference category.
4. **Black significance mismatch**: because Bryson reports *** for Black in Model 1, your p-value/star assignment is inconsistent with the table. This will correct only if the sample/SEs match; but also note: Bryson’s stars are based on his N/model—yours won’t match until you replicate N and variable construction.

---

## 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 2 / Generated “Model B”)

True Model 2 coefficients vs Generated Model B “Std_Beta”:

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.002233 | **wrong sign & near zero** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.194316*** | **too small in magnitude** |
| Household income per capita | -0.065 | -0.035654 | too small in magnitude |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.012431 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.069205 | close (ok) |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.119317** | close (ok) |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.066914 | somewhat high |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **dropped** | **missing** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.076128 | too high |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.101269* | **way too high** and has a star it shouldn’t |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.018895 | close (ok) |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.075385 | close (ok) |
| Constant | 7.860 | 4.957739 | **far off** |

**Fixes to align Model 2:**
1. **Restore Hispanic** (again).
2. **DV construction mismatch is likely huge here**. The intercept and multiple slopes (racism, education) being far off suggests you did not replicate the “12 remaining genres” count variable the same way.
3. **Occupational prestige sign mismatch** strongly suggests either:
   - different prestige scale,
   - reverse-coded prestige,
   - different sample/standardization.
4. **Conservative Protestant inflated**: likely different definition (e.g., you coded “cons_prot” differently than Bryson—perhaps including evangelicals broadly, or misclassifying denominations).

---

## 5) Standard errors: not comparable and should not be fabricated
- **True:** Table 2 **does not report standard errors**.
- **Generated:** does not show SEs, but does show p-values/stars and “Constant_p”.

**Mismatch in interpretation/reporting:** You’re effectively presenting inferential detail (p-values/stars) as if it were directly comparable to Bryson’s stars. But Bryson’s stars come from *his* model/sample; your computed stars will differ unless you replicate exactly.

**Fix options:**
- **Option 1 (best for “match the paper”):** Report **only standardized betas and Bryson’s printed stars**, and do not compute your own p-values.
- **Option 2 (if you must compute):** Clearly label stars as “replication-estimated p-values” and expect mismatch until N/variables match exactly.

---

## 6) Interpretation mismatches

### A. Racism score interpretation in Model 2
- **True:** Racism score is **positive (0.080)** (and not significant).
- **Generated:** Racism score is essentially **zero/negative (-0.002)**.

**Fix:** This is not a “wording” issue; it’s a model/data mismatch. Rebuild:
- the DV for Model 2,
- racism scale construction (items, direction, standardization),
- sample selection.

### B. Hispanic “dropped” implies incorrect narrative about composition
If you interpret “Hispanic dropped (no variation)” substantively, it would imply no Hispanics in the analytic sample—contradicted by Bryson’s table.

**Fix:** Treat this as a fatal data-processing error, not a finding.

---

## 7) What to change in your code/workflow (action checklist)

1. **Stop dropping Hispanic**:
   - Validate: `mean(hispanic)`, `std(hispanic)` in the modeling sample must be > 0.
2. **Replicate Bryson’s DV construction exactly**:
   - Identify the exact 6 “minority-linked” genres and the exact 12 “remaining” genres as coded in the survey.
   - Ensure the “dislike” threshold matches Bryson (e.g., “dislike” vs “strongly dislike”, or top-box).
   - Ensure counts range correctly (0–6; 0–12).
3. **Replicate independent variables exactly**:
   - **Income per capita**: confirm formula and whether it’s logged, scaled, or categorized.
   - **Occupational prestige**: confirm scale (e.g., NORC prestige) and coding direction.
   - **Conservative Protestant**: confirm denomination classification rule.
   - **Racism score**: confirm items, reverse-coding, and scaling.
4. **Match missing-data handling**:
   - Bryson’s N is larger; your pipeline is likely discarding too many cases.
   - Apply the same listwise deletion rules as the paper (if stated), otherwise replicate as closely as possible.
5. **Standardization procedure**:
   - Standardize predictors the same way (typically z-scores over the analysis sample).
   - Do not standardize the DV if you want the intercept comparable to the paper’s constant (though the paper’s presentation mixes standardized betas with a raw intercept; replicate that convention explicitly).
6. **Recompute and reprint**:
   - Once variables and sample match, your betas and stars should move toward the true table.

If you want, paste (a) your code for constructing the two DVs and (b) the code for race/ethnicity and `cons_prot`; those are the two biggest sources of the severe mismatches (Hispanic dropping, DV2 intercept/racism reversal, and Conservative Protestant inflation).
