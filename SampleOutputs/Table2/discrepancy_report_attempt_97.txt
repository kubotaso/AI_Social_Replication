Score: 36/100
============================================================

### 1) Outcome (DV) labels and model metadata mismatches

**Mismatch A — N differs (big)**
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=549; Model 2 N=507  
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605  
**Fix:** You are not reproducing Bryson’s analytic sample. To match the table you must:
1. Use the same source dataset/year and the same inclusion rules as the paper.
2. Apply the same missing-data handling as Bryson (very likely listwise deletion on the full set of variables used in each model, but on the paper’s dataset—not yours).
3. Ensure the DV constructions are identical and computed for all respondents before deletion.
4. If you’re using weights, use the same weights; if unweighted, run unweighted.

**Mismatch B — R² and Adjusted R² differ**
- **Generated:**  
  - Model 1 R²=0.133; Adj R²=0.114  
  - Model 2 R²=0.124; Adj R²=0.102
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R²=0.145; Adj R²=0.129  
  - Model 2 R²=0.147; Adj R²=0.130  
**Fix:** Once sample + DV + coding match, re-run OLS and compute R²/Adj R² from that exact regression. (Right now your reduced N alone will shift fit stats.)

**Mismatch C — Constant for Model 2**
- **Generated:** Constant = 4.908***  
- **True:** Constant = 7.860 (no stars shown in table)  
**Fix:** This will correct when (i) DV scale is identical, (ii) predictors are coded identically, and (iii) the same sample is used. A constant that far off strongly suggests your DV is on a different scale and/or you standardized/centered something differently than Bryson.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (variable-by-variable)

#### Model 1 (Minority-linked genres: 6)

Bryson reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas) for predictors, plus an intercept. Your values are close for a few variables but wrong for many.

| Variable | Generated | True | Problem type | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | 0.132** | 0.130** | minor numeric diff | Align sample + exact construction of racism scale; rounding should then match (0.130 vs 0.132). |
| Education | -0.180*** | -0.175*** | numeric diff | Same as above; also ensure education coding matches (years vs categories). |
| **Household income per capita** | **+0.00896** | **-0.037** | **sign + magnitude wrong** | Your income variable is not Bryson’s. Fix by: compute *household income per capita* exactly as in paper (income/household size), apply same transformations (often logged, capped, or midpoints), then standardize for beta. |
| Occupational prestige | -0.0190 | -0.020 | close | Sample/coding/rounding. |
| Female | -0.0716 | -0.057 | magnitude off | Ensure Female is coded 1=female, 0=male (and same sample). |
| Age | 0.1568*** | 0.163*** | numeric diff | Ensure age measured in years (not categories) and same sample. |
| **Black** | **-0.145\*** | **-0.132*** | **sign ok, significance wrong** | Your p-stars are wrong and magnitude differs. Fix: use Bryson’s betas and *do not compute p-values/stars from your different sample*. If reproducing from data, match sample and then compute stars; Black should be *** in Bryson. |
| **Hispanic** | **+0.00583** | **-0.058** | **sign wrong** | Likely miscoded ethnicity dummies and/or wrong reference category. Fix: create race/ethnicity dummies exactly as Bryson: White (omitted), Black, Hispanic, Other race. Ensure Hispanic=1 for Hispanic respondents regardless of race if that’s how paper defines it (table suggests mutually exclusive categories). |
| **Other race** | **+0.0109** | **-0.017** | **sign wrong** | Same dummy coding/reference-category issue as Hispanic. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.0831 | 0.063 | magnitude off | Ensure correct religious classification; Bryson’s “Conservative Protestant” usually requires denominational coding rules; don’t approximate. |
| No religion | 0.0683 | 0.057 | numeric diff | Same: correct coding of “no religion” dummy and reference group. |
| Southern | 0.0270 | 0.024 | close | Minor. |
| Constant | 2.463*** | 2.415*** | numeric diff | DV scale/sample mismatch. |

#### Model 2 (Remaining genres: 12)

Your Model 2 is substantially off for core relationships.

| Variable | Generated | True | Problem type | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| **Racism score** | **-0.00517** | **0.080** | **sign & magnitude wrong** | You are not reproducing Bryson’s Model 2 at all (variable construction/sample/model). Fix: use correct DV (“12 remaining”), correct racism scale, and correct sample; then compute standardized betas. |
| **Education** | **-0.189*** | **-0.242*** | magnitude too small | Education effect understated—again suggests wrong DV, sample, or standardization. |
| Household income per capita | -0.0383 | -0.065 | magnitude off | Fix income construction + sample. |
| **Occupational prestige** | **-0.0126** | **+0.005** | sign wrong | Coding mismatch or wrong standardization/sample. Ensure prestige variable matches Bryson’s occupational prestige measure and is entered correctly. |
| Female | -0.0678 | -0.070 | close | Minor. |
| Age | 0.1226** | 0.126** | close | Minor. |
| **Black** | **0.138\*** | **0.042** | magnitude & significance wrong | Big discrepancy: your Black coefficient is >3x and starred; Bryson’s is small and not starred. Fix race dummy coding + sample + DV. Also do not add stars unless reproducing exact test conditions. |
| Hispanic | -0.0972 | -0.029 | magnitude off | Same dummy coding and sample. |
| Other race | 0.0757 | 0.047 | magnitude off | Same. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.111* | 0.048 | magnitude & significance wrong | Religion coding mismatch and/or stars derived from wrong model. |
| No religion | 0.0185 | 0.024 | minor | — |
| Southern | 0.0665 | 0.069 | close | — |
| **Constant** | **4.908*** | **7.860** | big mismatch | DV scale mismatch (very likely). |

### 3) “Standard errors” issue (and why your output is structurally incompatible)

**Mismatch:** The prompt asks for mismatches in *standard errors*, but:
- **True table:** explicitly reports **no standard errors**.
- **Generated results:** also report **no SEs**, but you *do* report significance stars derived from somewhere.

**Fix:** To match the paper, you should:
1. **Remove standard errors/t-stats entirely** (since Bryson doesn’t print them).
2. If you show stars, they must match Bryson’s stars exactly. The only safe way to do that is either:
   - hard-code the stars exactly as printed, or
   - reproduce the exact dataset + estimation; otherwise your p-values will differ.
3. Label coefficients explicitly as **standardized betas** for predictors.

### 4) Interpretation mismatches (what your generated results imply vs. what Bryson’s table implies)

**Mismatch A — Racism effect in Model 2**
- **Generated implies:** essentially *no relationship* (≈0) or even slightly negative.
- **True implies:** a *positive* association (0.080), though not significant in the printed table.
**Fix:** Correct DV and racism scale, and ensure you are reporting standardized betas.

**Mismatch B — Race/ethnicity effects in Model 1**
- **Generated implies:** Hispanic slightly positive; Other race slightly positive.
- **True implies:** Hispanic negative; Other race negative.
**Fix:** Rebuild mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories with White omitted, matching Bryson’s definitions.

**Mismatch C — Income in Model 1**
- **Generated implies:** income increases dislike of minority-linked genres (positive).
- **True implies:** income decreases dislike (negative).
**Fix:** Correct income-per-capita construction and any transformation; then standardize.

### 5) How to make the generated analysis match the true table (practical checklist)

1. **Use the correct targets:** report Bryson’s **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas) for all predictors.
2. **Reconstruct both DVs exactly:**
   - DV1: count of dislike for Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin (0–6).
   - DV2: count of dislike for the other 12 genres (0–12).
   Ensure “dislike” threshold/coding matches the paper.
3. **Recode predictors to match Bryson:**
   - Racism score: same items, scaling direction, and aggregation.
   - Education: same metric (years vs categories).
   - Household income per capita: same definition, same transformation, same handling of top-codes/missing.
   - Occupational prestige: same prestige scale.
   - Race/ethnicity: mutually exclusive dummies with White omitted (Black, Hispanic, Other).
   - Religion: Conservative Protestant dummy and No religion dummy defined with Bryson’s classification rules.
   - Southern: census South definition.
4. **Match the analytic sample sizes (644; 605):**
   - Apply the same missing-data rules and (if used) survey weights.
5. **Only then compute:**
   - standardized betas for predictors,
   - R² and adjusted R²,
   - intercept (unstandardized) and stars **as printed** (note Model 2 constant has no stars in the table).

If you want, paste your model-specification code (or describe how you built each variable), and I can pinpoint exactly which construction step(s) are causing the sign flips for income, Hispanic/Other race, occupational prestige, and racism in Model 2.
