Score: 22/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable names / coding mismatches

**1.1 Racism variable labeling vs construct**
- **Generated:** “Racism score (0–5)” with betas 0.140 (ModelA) and **-0.013** (ModelB).
- **True:** “Racism score” with betas **0.130** (Model 1) and **0.080** (Model 2).
- **Mismatch:** ModelB coefficient has the **wrong sign** and is far from 0.080; ModelA slightly off.
- **Fix:** Ensure the racism index is constructed exactly as Bryson (same items, same direction, same scaling, same missing-data rule), then standardize. A sign flip usually comes from reverse-coding (e.g., higher = less racist) or using the wrong item direction.

**1.2 Education**
- **Generated label:** “Education (years)”
- **True label:** “Education”
- **Mismatch risk:** Bryson’s “Education” in GSS is often *years of schooling*, but if you used a different coding (degree categories → years, top-coding, etc.) you will not match.
- **Fix:** Use the same education measure as the paper (almost certainly GSS `EDUC` years), then standardize.

**1.3 Household income per capita**
- **Generated:** “Household income per capita (REALINC/HOMPOP)” and variable `income_pc`.
- **True:** “Household income per capita”.
- **Mismatch:** Conceptually similar, but Bryson’s construction may not be exactly `REALINC/HOMPOP` (paper-era income variable, inflation adjustment, household size definition, handling of 0/NA HOMPOP, trimming).
- **Fix:** Replicate the paper’s exact income-per-capita procedure (income variable used in 1996, inflation adjustment method, household size variable, and any exclusions). Then standardize.

**1.4 Occupational prestige**
- **Generated:** “Occupational prestige (PRESTG80)”
- **True:** “Occupational prestige”
- **Mismatch risk:** Bryson may have used a different prestige score (e.g., `PRESTG80` vs `PRESTG10` vs Duncan SEI) or different missing handling (including non-employed).
- **Fix:** Use the exact prestige variable specified in the replication notes/paper and match sample restrictions for valid prestige.

**1.5 Race dummy definitions**
- **Generated:** `black (RACE==2)`, `other_race (RACE==3)`, and “Hispanic (from ETHNIC; safe mapping; missing preserved)”.
- **True:** Black, Hispanic, Other race.
- **Mismatches:**
  - Your “Other race (RACE==3)” is almost certainly wrong for GSS-style `RACE` coding (often 1=White, 2=Black, 3=Other, but Hispanic is usually *ethnicity*, not race; and “Other” may include multiple groups).
  - Your Hispanic mapping is explicitly described as a **proxy** (“safe mapping; missing preserved”), which signals non-equivalence to the paper’s Hispanic definition.
- **Fix:** Create race/ethnicity dummies exactly as Bryson did:
  - Reference category must be **White, non-Hispanic** (very likely).
  - Hispanic must be derived from the same variable/years and same rule (e.g., `HISPANIC` or `ETHNIC` depending on survey year).
  - Ensure mutually exclusive categories and correct reference group.

**1.6 Religion variables**
- **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (RELIG==1 & DENOM==1, proxy; missing preserved)” and “No religion (RELIG==4)” but **No religion dropped (no variation)**.
- **True:** Conservative Protestant and No religion both included with nonzero coefficients (0.063 and 0.057 in Model 1; 0.048 and 0.024 in Model 2).
- **Mismatch:** Your analytic sample has **no variance** on `no_religion`, meaning your sample construction/coding is wrong relative to Bryson.
- **Fix:**
  - Correct the `RELIG` coding: in many GSS codings, “no religion” is not `RELIG==4` (and categories can vary by year).
  - Don’t collapse/recategorize in a way that eliminates “no religion”.
  - Verify filtering: you likely restricted to a subset where `RELIG` is missing or forced into one category (e.g., keeping only Christians via `DENOM` nonmissing).

**1.7 Southern**
- **Generated:** “Southern (REGION==3)”
- **True:** “Southern”
- **Mismatch risk:** “South” may be a region definition (South vs non-South), but `REGION==3` may not correspond to South depending on coding scheme.
- **Fix:** Use the same region variable and coding Bryson used (often a “South” dummy based on Census region, not a numeric equality that may be wrong).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **all coefficient mismatches** (Generated vs True). I list True first, then your Generated.

#### Model 1 (DV: minority-linked genres; your ModelA)
- Racism: **0.130** vs **0.140** (close but not exact)
- Education: **-0.175** vs **-0.260** (too negative)
- Income pc: **-0.037** vs **-0.012** (too small in magnitude)
- Occ prestige: **-0.020** vs **+0.058** (**wrong sign**)
- Female: **-0.057** vs **-0.034** (too small magnitude)
- Age: **0.163** vs **0.175** (close)
- Black: **-0.132** vs **-0.177** (too negative)
- Hispanic: **-0.058** vs **-0.007** (far too close to zero)
- Other race: **-0.017** vs **-0.005** (too close to zero)
- Conservative Protestant: **0.063** vs **0.120** (too large)
- No religion: **0.057** vs **dropped/NaN** (not estimated)
- Southern: **0.024** vs **-0.059** (**wrong sign**)

#### Model 2 (DV: remaining genres; your ModelB)
- Racism: **0.080** vs **-0.013** (**wrong sign**)
- Education: **-0.242** vs **-0.165** (not negative enough)
- Income pc: **-0.065** vs **-0.077** (close-ish, slightly more negative)
- Occ prestige: **0.005** vs **-0.079** (**wrong sign**)
- Female: **-0.070** vs **-0.082** (close-ish)
- Age: **0.126** vs **0.127** (matches well)
- Black: **0.042** vs **0.039** (matches well)
- Hispanic: **-0.029** vs **-0.023** (close)
- Other race: **0.047** vs **0.122** (too large)
- Conservative Protestant: **0.048** vs **0.142** (too large)
- No religion: **0.024** vs **dropped/NaN** (not estimated)
- Southern: **0.069** vs **0.104** (too large)

**What these patterns imply:** you are not just “slightly off”; several predictors have sign reversals (prestige, South, racism in Model 2), and multiple effects are inflated/deflated—classic symptoms of **non-matching sample + non-matching variable construction**.

---

### 3) Standard errors mismatch

- **Generated:** You present no SEs in the displayed coefficient tables, but you were instructed to compare SEs; also your output includes significance stars, implying p-values were computed from SEs/t-stats.
- **True:** The paper explicitly **does not report standard errors** for Table 2.
- **Mismatch:** You cannot “match” standard errors because there are none in the published table.
- **Fix:** Remove any claim that SEs match the paper. If you want to replicate significance stars, you must compute them from your model—but then you must also match Bryson’s **N, sample, weights, and variable coding**; otherwise stars won’t align either.

---

### 4) Fit statistics and constants mismatches

**4.1 N (sample size)**
- **Generated N:** 261 (ModelA) and 259 (ModelB)
- **True N:** 644 (Model 1) and 605 (Model 2)
- **Mismatch:** Massive; your analytic sample is less than half the size.
- **Fix:** Recreate Bryson’s analytic sample:
  - Use the same survey years/combined waves as the paper.
  - Apply the same inclusion/exclusion rules.
  - Handle missing data the same way (listwise deletion consistent with paper).
  - Use weights if Bryson did (GSS often uses WTSSALL/WTSS).

**4.2 R² and Adjusted R²**
- **Generated:** R²=0.178 (Adj 0.142) and R²=0.151 (Adj 0.114)
- **True:** R²=0.145 (Adj 0.129) and R²=0.147 (Adj 0.130)
- **Mismatch:** Model 1 R² too high; Model 2 close-ish on R² but Adj R² too low.
- **Fix:** Once N and coding match, R² should move toward the published values. Also ensure you are running **OLS on the same DV construction** and (if applicable) using the same weights.

**4.3 Constants**
- **Generated constants:** 2.593*** (ModelA) and 5.185*** (ModelB)
- **True constants:** 2.415*** (Model 1) and **7.860** (Model 2; note: in the “True Results” you provided it’s shown without stars)
- **Mismatch:** Both constants differ; Model 2 constant is extremely far (5.19 vs 7.86).
- **Fix:** Constants will only align if:
  - DV is constructed on the same scale (count of dislikes out of same number of genres, same coding of “dislike”).
  - Predictors are centered/standardized the same way (though constants in standardized models depend on whether DV is standardized; Bryson reports standardized *coefficients* but the constant is on the original DV scale).

---

### 5) Interpretation / reporting mismatches

**5.1 You implicitly treat “No religion” as legitimately dropped**
- **Generated note:** “dropped (no variation in analytic sample)”
- **True:** Included and nonzero in both models.
- **Fix:** Treat this as an error, not a feature: it indicates your analytic sample or coding is wrong.

**5.2 Your significance stars don’t match the table**
Examples:
- **Model 1 Age:** True 0.163***, Generated 0.175** (wrong star level)
- **Model 1 Black:** True -0.132***, Generated -0.177* (wrong star level)
- **Model 2 Racism:** True 0.080 (no star), Generated -0.013 (no star) but sign wrong.
- **Fix:** Stars will only align when you match:
  - the exact N,
  - weights,
  - variable coding,
  - and (crucially) Bryson’s standard-error calculation assumptions (OLS, two-tailed tests).  
  But since the paper prints stars without SEs, you should focus on matching coefficients and N first.

### 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996)

1. **Use the correct dataset/time period and weights**
   - Match the paper’s GSS years and any pooled design.
   - Apply the same weight Bryson used (if any). If unknown, test WTSSALL/WTSS and see which reproduces N/R² best.

2. **Rebuild the DVs exactly**
   - Model 1 DV must be the **count of dislikes** for exactly: Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin.
   - Model 2 DV must be the **count of dislikes** for the other 12 genres.
   - Match how “dislike” is coded (e.g., bottom category only vs bottom two categories), and handle “don’t know/NA” exactly as paper.

3. **Rebuild key predictors exactly**
   - Racism index: same items, same direction, same missing rules; then standardize.
   - Education: use the same education metric (likely `EDUC` years).
   - Income per capita: same income measure, inflation adjustment, and household size definition; same trimming/exclusions.

4. **Fix categorical codings and reference categories**
   - Race/ethnicity: ensure White non-Hispanic is the reference; Hispanic derived correctly; Other race correctly defined.
   - Religion: define Conservative Protestant and No religion using the paper’s scheme; confirm variation exists.
   - South: ensure your dummy truly represents “Southern” as Bryson defined it.

5. **Match missing-data handling**
   - Bryson’s reported N implies far less deletion than your current pipeline. Identify where you are dropping cases (especially `DENOM`, `RELIG`, prestige, income) and adjust to match the paper’s treatment.

6. **Run OLS and report standardized coefficients**
   - Standardize predictors (and/or use a routine that returns standardized betas) in the same way as Bryson.
   - Do **not** invent SE comparisons; the table has none.

If you paste the code/workflow you used to construct (a) the two DVs, (b) racism score, (c) Hispanic and religion dummies, and (d) the exact filtering steps, I can point to the exact lines that are producing the sign flips (prestige, South, Model 2 racism) and the sample-size collapse (N≈260 vs 600+).
