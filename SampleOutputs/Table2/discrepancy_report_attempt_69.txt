Score: 32/100
============================================================

### 1) Sample size / fit statistics mismatches (biggest structural discrepancies)

| Item | Generated | True (Bryson Table 2) | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Model A N | 438 | 644 | Your analytic sample is far smaller than the paper’s. Coefficients will not match if the sample differs. | Recreate the paper’s inclusion rules and missing-data handling. Do **not** listwise-delete on variables the paper didn’t require (e.g., DON’T require DENOM if Bryson didn’t). Ensure the same year/wave and population filters. |
| Model B N | 406 | 605 | Same issue. | Same fix. |
| Model A R² | 0.1276 | 0.145 | Fit differs because sample and/or variable construction differ. | Match sample + variable coding; then recompute standardized OLS. |
| Model A Adj R² | 0.1030 | 0.129 | Same. | Same. |
| Model B R² | 0.1341 | 0.147 | Same. | Same. |
| Model B Adj R² | 0.1077 | 0.130 | Same. | Same. |
| Model A constant | 2.695*** | 2.415*** | Intercept differs; again reflects different estimation sample/coding (and possibly DV construction). | Match DV construction and sample; then refit. |
| Model B constant | 5.777*** | 7.860 (no stars shown in your “true” transcription) | Intercept differs substantially. Also: the paper’s table presents standardized coefficients but still prints an unstandardized constant; your transcription says 7.860 without stars. Your generated output adds stars. | Once sample/coding match, confirm whether Bryson reported a *significant* constant (many tables don’t star constants). If you want to match the table, suppress significance stars for the constant and print it exactly as shown. |

### 2) Variable name/definition mismatches

These aren’t just cosmetic—some indicate **different coding** than the paper.

1) **Racism measure**
- **Generated label:** “Racism score (0–5; strict sum of 5 dichotomies)”
- **True:** “Racism score”
- **Problem:** Your “strict sum of 5 dichotomies” may or may not match Bryson’s construction (and “strict” often implies extra missingness).
- **Fix:** Rebuild the racism index exactly as in Bryson (same items, same recodes, same missing-data rule). If Bryson allowed partial completion (e.g., mean of nonmissing then scaled), your “strict sum” will shrink N and change coefficients.

2) **Conservative Protestant**
- **Generated:** “proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1; DENOM missing -> 0 if Protestant”
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant”
- **Problem:** That proxy is very likely not identical to Bryson’s definition and your “DENOM missing -> 0” is an assumption that can bias estimates and change N.
- **Fix:** Use the exact RELIG/DENOM coding scheme used in the article (often a standard GSS fundamentalist/moderate/liberal Protestant classification or Steensland-style tradition codes; Bryson 1996 predates Steensland but still won’t be “RELIG==1 & DENOM==1”). Do **not** impute missing DENOM to 0 unless the paper says so. Prefer listwise or a “missing denomination” indicator if needed.

3) **Race/ethnicity categories**
- **Generated:** “Black (RACE==2)”, “Other race (RACE==3)”, “Hispanic (indicator from ETHNIC; see diagnostics)”
- **True:** “Black”, “Other race”, “Hispanic”
- **Problem:** “RACE==3” as “Other race” is not generally correct in many GSS codings (often 1=White, 2=Black, 3=Other is plausible, but you must confirm year-specific codes). Also “Hispanic from ETHNIC” may not match Bryson’s operationalization (some use HISPANIC ethnicity variable; some use race/ethnic combined logic).
- **Fix:** Match Bryson’s dummy-variable construction precisely, including reference category (almost surely White non-Hispanic), and ensure Hispanic coding does not double-count with race categories unless the paper did so.

4) **Dependent variables**
- Your DV names look aligned, but the **means** suggest possible construction differences and the **intercepts** definitely do.
- **Fix:** Confirm: (a) exactly which genres are in the “minority-linked 6,” (b) what constitutes “dislike” (e.g., “dislike” vs “never listen” vs “not like”), (c) how “don’t know/NA” treated, (d) whether counts are 0–6 and 0–12 exactly as in the paper. Any deviation changes constants and coefficients.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (every variable)

Below I list **Generated standardized beta vs True standardized beta** and the mismatch direction.

#### Model A (Minority-linked genres: 6)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.1279** | 0.130** | Slight numeric mismatch (close). |
| Education | -0.2077*** | -0.175*** | Too negative in generated (larger magnitude). |
| Household income pc | +0.0317 | -0.037 | Wrong sign. |
| Occupational prestige | +0.0067 | -0.020 | Wrong sign. |
| Female | -0.0742 | -0.057 | Magnitude off. |
| Age | +0.1399** | +0.163*** | Magnitude off and **significance level wrong** (*** vs **). |
| Black | -0.1594** | -0.132*** | Magnitude off and significance wrong (*** vs **). |
| Hispanic | -0.0618 | -0.058 | Close numeric, OK (but depends on correct coding). |
| Other race | +0.0175 | -0.017 | Wrong sign. |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.0904 | +0.063 | Too large. |
| No religion | +0.0643 | +0.057 | Close-ish. |
| Southern | -0.0145 | +0.024 | Wrong sign. |

#### Model B (Remaining 12 genres)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.0335 | +0.080 | Wrong sign and magnitude. |
| Education | -0.2234*** | -0.242*** | Magnitude off. |
| Household income pc | -0.0309 | -0.065 | Magnitude off (too small). |
| Occupational prestige | -0.0321 | +0.005 | Wrong sign. |
| Female | -0.0827 | -0.070 | Magnitude off. |
| Age | +0.1014* | +0.126** | Magnitude and significance off. |
| Black | +0.0429 | +0.042 | Essentially matches (tiny rounding). |
| Hispanic | -0.0911 | -0.029 | Too negative (much larger magnitude). |
| Other race | +0.0950 | +0.047 | Too large. |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.0991 | +0.048 | Too large. |
| No religion | +0.0133 | +0.024 | Too small. |
| Southern | +0.0875 | +0.069 | Too large. |

So: **nearly every coefficient differs**, and several have **wrong sign**. That strongly indicates you are not reproducing Bryson’s data handling/coding and/or not using the same sample.

### 4) Standard errors mismatch

- **Generated output:** asks for/implicitly suggests standard errors and uses significance stars.
- **True:** Bryson Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients only**; **no SEs** are shown.
- **Mismatch:** You cannot “match” standard errors because the table doesn’t provide them.
- **Fix options (choose one to match the paper):**
  1) **Remove SE column entirely** and report only standardized betas + stars (as printed).
  2) If you must compute SEs for your own analysis, clearly label them as **not in Bryson (1996)** and don’t claim they are “true results.”

---

### 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches

1) **Racism effect in Model B**
- **Generated:** negative (-0.0335), interpreted as racism reducing dislike of remaining genres (if you interpreted it that way).
- **True:** positive (0.080) and **not significant**.
- **Fix:** After correcting coding/sample, racism in Model B should be **positive and non-significant** (no stars).

2) **Age significance**
- **Model A:** True is **0.163***, generated shows **0.1399**.
- **Model B:** True is **0.126**\*\*, generated shows **0.1014***.
- **Fix:** Once replicated, ensure stars match Bryson’s thresholds and two-tailed tests. If you compute p-values, note Bryson’s stars are from *their* model; you should only display stars identical to the table when your coefficients match.

3) **Black in Model A**
- **True:** -0.132***; **Generated:** -0.1594**.
- **Fix:** Match sample and coding; and ensure reference category consistent.

---

### 6) Concrete “how to fix” checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson

1) **Match the analytic sample sizes (target N=644 and N=605).**
   - Identify every place you drop observations:
     - “strict sum” racism construction likely drops many cases → loosen to Bryson’s rule.
     - DENOM handling likely drops or misclassifies → recode per paper.
     - Any missingness on DV items (music dislikes) → match Bryson’s inclusion rule (e.g., require responses to all genres? or allow partial?).
   - Once N matches, move on; until then coefficients will not align.

2) **Recode the independent variables exactly as Bryson.**
   - Education: verify scaling (years vs degree categories converted to years).
   - Income per capita: confirm whether Bryson used **logged income**, **raw**, **top-coded handling**, and exactly how HOMPOP was handled (0? missing?).
   - Occupational prestige: ensure same prestige scale and missing coding.
   - Southern: ensure region coding consistent with GSS and Bryson’s definition.
   - Race/ethnicity: ensure mutually exclusive dummies vs overlapping Hispanic with race.

3) **Recode Conservative Protestant correctly.**
   - Do not use a “RELIG==1 & DENOM==1” shortcut unless it’s documented as identical.
   - Do not default missing DENOM to 0; that changes both composition and estimates.

4) **Confirm DV construction item-by-item.**
   - Verify the 6 “minority-linked” genres are exactly the same as Bryson’s footnote and coding (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin).
   - Verify “dislike” definition: which response categories count as dislike?
   - Verify whether Bryson used weights; using or not using weights can move coefficients.

5) **Ensure you are reporting standardized OLS coefficients (betas), not standardized predictors only.**
   - Use an approach that guarantees true standardized betas (e.g., standardize all variables including DV, then run OLS; or compute betas from unstandardized b via SD ratios).
   - If you standardize X but not Y, coefficients will not match.

6) **Match presentation conventions.**
   - Remove SEs (not in table).
   - Use the same star cutoffs and two-tailed tests.
   - Print constants and R² exactly as table (and consider suppressing stars on constants if Bryson didn’t star them).

If you tell me (a) which dataset/year you used (GSS 1993?) and (b) the exact recodes for racism and Conservative Protestant you implemented, I can pinpoint which coding decision(s) are most responsible for the sign flips (income, prestige, other race, southern, and racism in Model B).
