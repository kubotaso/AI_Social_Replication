Score: 2/100
============================================================

## 1) Variable-name / coding mismatches

### A. “Racism score (0–5)” vs “Racism score”
- **Mismatch:** Generated label adds the scale “(0–5)”. The paper’s table just says “Racism score.”
- **Fix:** Rename only (cosmetic) unless you *actually* rescaled the variable. If you did rescale, you must replicate Bryson’s original scaling; otherwise standardized betas could still differ due to sample/weighting, but the label should not imply a scale you didn’t verify.

### B. “Education (years)” vs “Education”
- **Mismatch:** Generated label specifies “years.” Table says “Education” (likely years, but not explicitly).
- **Fix:** Either (1) verify Bryson’s education measure is years and keep it, or (2) rename to match (“Education”) to avoid implying a different operationalization.

### C. Hispanic construction and religious coding are non-equivalent
- **Mismatch:** Generated uses **“Hispanic (constructed from ETHNIC; rule=eth_in_1_2_3_4)”** and **“Conservative Protestant (RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”**. The paper’s table uses “Hispanic” and “Conservative Protestant” but does not specify these rules; your rule may not match Bryson’s.
- **Fix:** Recreate **exact dummy definitions** used in Bryson (1996). If you can’t, you must not claim you reproduced Table 2; present them as “approximate replication with different coding.”

### D. “No religion” is dropped in generated output but present in the true table
- **Mismatch:** Generated: `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion`, and coefficient is `NaN`. True results include **No religion** with coefficients **0.057** (Model 1) and **0.024** (Model 2).
- **Fix options (must do one):**
  1. **Data fix:** Ensure the “No religion” dummy actually varies (not all 0/1 due to filtering, recode error, or missing-to-zero mistake).  
  2. **Model/spec fix:** If you created a set of religion dummies, make sure you did **not** accidentally define “No religion” as the reference category *and* also include it as a predictor.  
  3. **Sample fix:** Your analytic sample is tiny (N≈260), which can easily eliminate categories. Use the correct GSS years/cases and inclusion rules so “No religion” appears (Bryson: N=644 / 605).

## 2) Coefficient (standardized beta) mismatches — every row

Below: **Generated vs True** (Model 1 = your ModelA; Model 2 = your ModelB). All are mismatched in value; many are mismatched in sign.

### Model 1 (DV: Dislike of Rap/Reggae/Blues-R&B/Jazz/Gospel/Latin)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism | 0.144* | 0.130** | value + sig mismatch |
| Education | -0.260*** | -0.175*** | substantially too negative |
| Income pc | -0.013 | -0.037 | too close to 0 |
| Prestige | 0.057 | -0.020 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.036 | -0.057 | magnitude mismatch |
| Age | 0.174** | 0.163*** | sig mismatch |
| Black | -0.207 | -0.132*** | too negative; sig mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.040 | -0.058 | **sign mismatch** |
| Other race | -0.005 | -0.017 | magnitude mismatch |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.117 | 0.063 | magnitude mismatch |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | 0.057 | **missing predictor** |
| Southern | -0.059 | 0.024 | **sign mismatch** |
| Constant | 2.599 | 2.415*** | value + sig mismatch |
| R² | 0.178 | 0.145 | mismatch |
| Adj R² | 0.142 | 0.129 | mismatch |
| N | 261 | 644 | **major mismatch** |

### Model 2 (DV: Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism | -0.009 | 0.080 | **sign mismatch** |
| Education | -0.165* | -0.242*** | too small; sig mismatch |
| Income pc | -0.079 | -0.065 | value mismatch |
| Prestige | -0.083 | 0.005 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.084 | -0.070 | value mismatch |
| Age | 0.125 | 0.126** | sig mismatch |
| Black | 0.025 | 0.042 | value mismatch |
| Hispanic | 0.018 | -0.029 | **sign mismatch** |
| Other race | 0.124* | 0.047 | magnitude + sig mismatch |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.141* | 0.048 | magnitude + sig mismatch |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | 0.024 | **missing predictor** |
| Southern | 0.101 | 0.069 | value mismatch |
| Constant | 5.198 | 7.860 | large mismatch |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.147 | slight mismatch |
| Adj R² | 0.113 | 0.130 | mismatch |
| N | 259 | 605 | **major mismatch** |

**Bottom line:** This is not a close numerical replication; it is a different analysis (different sample, likely different measures/coding, possibly different weighting, and potentially different DV construction).

## 3) Standard errors: requested but not applicable to the “true” table

- **Mismatch:** You asked to compare **standard errors**, but **Table 2 does not report SEs**. Your generated output also doesn’t show SEs—only betas + significance stars. So **SE comparison is impossible** from the provided “true results.”
- **Fix:** If you want SEs, you must compute them from the same microdata and model specification; you cannot “match” Bryson’s SEs because they aren’t printed in Table 2. Instead, match **betas, N, R²**, and **significance markers** (as a consistency check).

---

## 4) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation/reporting errors)

Even where betas are somewhat near, the **stars don’t match** (e.g., Racism and Age in Model 1; Age in Model 2; Black in Model 1).

Common causes + fixes:
1. **Wrong N / wrong sample years** → p-values change.  
   - Fix: replicate the exact sample definition (Bryson’s N=644/605).
2. **Weights/design effects** (GSS analyses often use weights; Bryson may have used them).  
   - Fix: apply the correct weight variable and estimation approach used in the paper. If weighted OLS was used, do that; if unweighted, don’t weight.
3. **Different missing-data handling** (listwise vs pairwise vs imputation).  
   - Fix: use the same missing-data rule as Bryson (very likely listwise deletion given fixed N reported by model).

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by your output

### A. Racism in Model 2
- **Generated implies:** racism ~ 0 (slightly negative), not significant.
- **True table says:** racism is **positive (0.080)** (though no stars shown—so likely not significant at .05).
- **Fix:** This is a substantive reversal. It almost certainly comes from **DV construction differences** and/or **sample differences**. Rebuild the DV exactly as Bryson did (same genre items, same scaling/combination rules), then rerun.

### B. Regional and ethnic effects (Southern, Hispanic) flip signs
- **Generated:** Southern negative in Model 1; Hispanic positive in both models.
- **True:** Southern positive in both; Hispanic negative in both.
- **Fix:** This pattern strongly suggests at least one of:
  - different dummy reference groups / coding errors (e.g., Hispanic coded backwards),
  - different sample composition (your N is less than half),
  - different dependent-variable coding direction (e.g., “dislike” reversed to “like” for some items).
  - Action: audit coding for each dummy and DV polarity with simple checks (means by group should align with expectation and with the paper’s direction).

---

## 6) The biggest single discrepancy: sample size (N)

- **Generated N:** 261 and 259  
- **True N:** 644 and 605

That alone can explain many coefficient/significance differences.

**Fix checklist to get N to match:**
1. Use the same **dataset source and years** Bryson used (likely GSS; confirm exact waves/years in the paper).
2. Apply the same **age restrictions**, respondent inclusion rules, and nonresponse handling.
3. Ensure you included all genre items needed to compute each DV; listwise deletion on those items will drop many cases—verify you’re not dropping extra cases unnecessarily (e.g., due to mis-coded “Don’t know” as missing for *all* predictors).
4. Verify you didn’t accidentally subset (e.g., only one year, only one race, only those with complete income/prestige, etc.).

---

## 7) How to make the generated analysis match Bryson’s Table 2

To align with the “true” results, you need to replicate **four things simultaneously**:

1. **Exact DV construction** (two indices)
   - Same set of genres in each DV.
   - Same response coding direction (higher = more dislike).
   - Same scaling/standardization before index creation (if any).
   - Same handling of missing genre responses.

2. **Exact IV coding**
   - Race/ethnicity dummies consistent with Bryson.
   - Religion categories consistent with Bryson (and ensure “No religion” varies and is included).
   - Education/income/prestige measures consistent (same units and transformations).
   - South definition matches paper (likely Census South; your `REGION==3` might not correspond).

3. **Same estimation details**
   - Standardized OLS coefficients (beta weights): confirm you’re standardizing *within the analytic sample* after listwise deletion.
   - Weights: apply (or don’t) exactly as Bryson did.
   - Same set of predictors (no extras, no omissions).

4. **Same analytic sample**
   - Match N (644 and 605). If you can’t match N, you should expect betas/stars to differ.

If you want, paste (a) your DV construction code, (b) how you coded race/ethnicity/religion/region, (c) the filter steps that lead to N=261/259, and I can point to the specific line(s) that are producing the sign flips and the big N drop.
