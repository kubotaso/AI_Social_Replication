Score: 19/100
============================================================

### 0) Core structural problem: you’re comparing **different quantities**
- **True Table 2 reports only standardized coefficients (β) + sig stars. It does not report SEs, t, or p.**
- Your “Generated Results” mix:
  - a “table_full” with **unstandardized b**, **SE**, **t**, **p**, and **beta_std**
  - a “paper_style” table that looks like it’s trying to mimic the paper (standardized coef + stars)
- Because Table 2 has no SEs, **every SE/t/p-value in the generated output is not verifiable from the paper and cannot be “matched.”**

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match Table 2: output **only standardized coefficients (β)** and stars (computed from your own model if you have the microdata), but do **not** claim the SEs come from the paper.
- If you want to reproduce Table 2 exactly: you must (a) use the same GSS 1993 sample restrictions and variables, then (b) compute standardized coefficients. Only then can you compare stars/coefficients.

## 1) Sample size and fit statistics mismatches (major)
### Model 1 / ModelA
**Generated (ModelA_fit):**
- N = **340**
- R² = **0.2059**, Adj R² = **0.1818**

**True (Model 1):**
- N = **644**
- R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**

**Mismatch:** N and fit are far off → you are not estimating on the same sample and/or same DV construction.

**Fix**
- Recreate the paper’s analytic sample (GSS 1993):
  - same inclusion/exclusion rules (nonmissing on DV + all IVs used)
  - same weighting decisions (if any; Bryson may have used GSS weights—verify)
  - same DV index construction (count of disliked genres in the specified set)
- Verify your DV exactly matches: *“Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”* and is **a count (0–6)**.
- Only after matching N≈644 and similar DV distribution should R² be comparable.

### Model 2 / ModelB
**Generated (ModelB_fit):**
- N = **326**
- R² = **0.1657**, Adj R² = **0.1393**

**True (Model 2):**
- N = **605**
- R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**

Same issue: wrong sample and/or wrong DV.

**Fix**
- DV must be **count of disliked among the “12 remaining genres”** (0–12).
- Use the same missing-data handling as the paper (likely listwise deletion).

---

## 2) Variable set / naming mismatches (you have missing or dropped predictors)
### “No religion” is mishandled
Your fit tables say: `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: no_religion`.

But in the paper, **“No religion” is included** and has coefficients:
- Model 1: **0.057** (ns)
- Model 2: **0.024** (ns)

**Mismatch:** you dropped a variable that must be estimated.

**Fix**
- This is almost certainly because in your estimation sample **no_religion is constant** (all 0s or all 1s), which implies:
  - you filtered to a subgroup (e.g., only religious respondents), or
  - you miscoded `no_religion`, or
  - you inadvertently set missing to 0/1 incorrectly.
- Recode religion dummies exactly as in the paper:
  - Conservative Protestant (binary)
  - No religion (binary)
  - (Implicit reference category: other religions)
- Check frequencies **before** modeling on the analytic sample:
  - `table(no_religion)` should have both 0 and 1.
- Do not drop it; fix the sample/coding so it varies.

### “Other race” appears to be missing/garbled
In the true table, race dummies are:
- Black
- Hispanic
- Other race
(with White as reference)

In your generated tables there is a row that is entirely `NaN` in both models (in the middle of the block), strongly suggesting a dummy was not estimated (collinearity/empty category) and got output as NaN. That is plausibly **Other race** (or another dummy).

**Fix**
- Ensure race categories are coded so each dummy has observations.
- Make sure you include **three** race dummies (Black, Hispanic, Other) with **White omitted** (not all four, which causes perfect multicollinearity).
- Verify “Other race” has nonzero N in 1993 GSS after your exclusions.

### Potential order/labeling problem
Your “paper_style” output lists 13 entries and puts the constant at the bottom, but the true table is 13 rows including constant. Because you don’t show variable names, it’s impossible to verify row-to-variable alignment—but given the NaNs and wrong coefficients, it’s very likely rows are **shifted/mislabeled**.

**Fix**
- Print coefficient tables with explicit variable names.
- Enforce a canonical order matching the paper:
  1) Racism score  
  2) Education  
  3) Household income per capita  
  4) Occupational prestige  
  5) Female  
  6) Age  
  7) Black  
  8) Hispanic  
  9) Other race  
  10) Conservative Protestant  
  11) No religion  
  12) Southern  
  13) Constant

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas) — Model 1
True standardized coefficients (Model 1):
- Racism **0.130** (**)  
- Education **-0.175** (***)  
- Income **-0.037**  
- Occ prestige **-0.020**  
- Female **-0.057**  
- Age **0.163** (***)  
- Black **-0.132** (***)  
- Hispanic **-0.058**  
- Other race **-0.017**  
- Cons Prot **0.063**  
- No religion **0.057**  
- Southern **0.024**  
- Constant **2.415** (***)

Your generated standardized betas (ModelA_table_paper_style) appear to be:
- 0.145630 **  (close-ish to Racism 0.130**, but not equal)
- -0.264051 *** (too large vs Education -0.175)
- -0.040446 (close-ish to Income -0.037)
- 0.026356 (sign mismatch vs Occ prestige -0.020)
- -0.024067 (doesn’t match Female -0.057)
- 0.207664 *** (too large vs Age 0.163)
- -0.122183 * (mismatch in significance vs Black -0.132***)
- NaN (should be Hispanic -0.058 or Other race -0.017 etc., not NaN)
- -0.001474 (doesn’t match any true coefficient magnitude)
- 0.075971 (maybe Cons Prot 0.063, but off)
- NaN (again shouldn’t be NaN; “No religion” is 0.057)
- 0.021557 (close-ish to Southern 0.024)
- Constant shown as 2.546970 ***, but true constant is 2.415*** (off)

**Fixes**
1) **Standardization method**: The paper reports standardized coefficients. Ensure you compute β as:
   - run OLS on **z-scored** predictors and (typically) z-scored DV, or compute β from unstandardized coefficients using SD ratios.
   - For dummy variables, standardized coefficients depend on SD of the dummy; that’s okay, but must be based on the same sample.
2) **Same DV & sample**: the inflated education/age betas often indicate a different DV composition or restricted sample.
3) **Match coding direction**: Occupational prestige sign flip suggests either:
   - prestige coded inversely, or
   - row mislabeling.
   Confirm variable definitions match the paper’s (prestige higher = higher status).
4) **Stars**: Your stars come from your p-values; but the paper’s stars are from its own model (N=644). Even if coefficients matched approximately, stars will differ unless the sample/model matches.

---

## 4) Coefficient mismatches — Model 2
True standardized coefficients (Model 2):
- Racism **0.080** (ns)
- Education **-0.242***  
- Income **-0.065**  
- Occ prestige **0.005**  
- Female **-0.070**  
- Age **0.126** (**)  
- Black **0.042**  
- Hispanic **-0.029**  
- Other race **0.047**  
- Cons Prot **0.048**  
- No religion **0.024**  
- Southern **0.069**  
- Constant **7.860** (no stars reported in your excerpt; paper shows constant 7.860)

Your generated standardized betas (ModelB_table_paper_style):
- 0.009003 (too small vs Racism 0.080)
- -0.206823 ** (education too small in magnitude vs -0.242*** and wrong stars)
- -0.091304 (income too negative vs -0.065)
- -0.022631 (occ prestige should be +0.005; sign mismatch)
- -0.073210 (female close to -0.070)
- 0.130060 * (age close to 0.126 but star mismatch: should be **)
- 0.109893 (black should be 0.042; too large)
- NaN (should be Hispanic -0.029 or Other race 0.047, etc.)
- 0.102174 (doesn’t match Cons Prot 0.048)
- 0.081916 (doesn’t match No religion 0.024)
- NaN (again)
- 0.132570 * (southern should be 0.069; too large)
- Constant 5.062068 *** vs true 7.860 (very wrong)

**Fixes**
- Same as Model 1: DV definition, sample, standardization, and variable coding.
- Constant being far off strongly suggests your DV is on a different scale (e.g., not 0–12 count, or different set of genres, or you standardized DV for some outputs but not others).

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches (what you should/not claim)
- Your generated output implies you have SEs/p-values “matching” the paper. That’s impossible from Table 2.
- The correct interpretation target is: **direction, relative magnitude, and significance pattern** of standardized coefficients for the specific DVs.

**Fix**
- In write-up, explicitly state:
  - “Table 2 reports standardized coefficients only; SEs are not available.”
  - If you computed your own SEs from microdata, label them as replication outputs, not extracted from the table.

---

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 2
1) **Rebuild the dependent variables exactly**
   - Model 1 DV: count disliked among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}. Ensure each genre “dislike” is coded exactly like Bryson (e.g., “dislike” vs “like/neutral,” handling of “don’t know”).
   - Model 2 DV: count disliked among the remaining 12 genres (list must match the questionnaire/paper).
2) **Use the same predictors and reference categories**
   - Racism score: must match the paper’s scale construction (items, coding, averaging/summing).
   - Education: years or degree? match exactly.
   - Household income per capita: construct from household income / household size in the same units and transformations.
   - Occupational prestige: same prestige scale.
   - Race dummies: omit White as reference; include Black/Hispanic/Other.
   - Religion dummies: include Conservative Protestant and No religion; omit other as reference.
   - Southern: binary.
   - Female: binary (Female=1).
3) **Match sample selection**
   - GSS 1993 only
   - same age restrictions (if any), same handling of missingness (likely listwise)
   - check that N matches (≈644, 605)
4) **Compute standardized coefficients**
   - Standardize variables on the final analytic sample used for each model.
5) **Generate a “paper-style” table**
   - show only standardized coefficients + stars with thresholds (*<.05, **<.01, ***<.001)
   - do not include SEs (unless you explicitly present them as your replication add-on).

If you paste the variable-name-to-row mapping from your generated tables (or the model formula you used), I can identify *exactly* which row corresponds to which variable and pinpoint the specific sign/scale miscoding behind each mismatch.
