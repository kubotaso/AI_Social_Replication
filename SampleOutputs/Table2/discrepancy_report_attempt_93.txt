Score: 21/100
============================================================

### 1) Scope/format mismatches (what the table is vs. what you generated)

**Mismatch A: Sample size (N)**
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=438; Model 2 N=406  
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605  
**Fix:** Use the same analytic sample definition as Bryson (1996). Your output implies listwise deletion or additional restrictions. To match the paper:
- replicate the paper’s inclusion rules (same survey wave, same age restrictions if any, same missing-data handling),
- use the same weights (if the paper uses them),
- and apply **the same listwise deletion set across the exact variables in each model** (paper’s N differs across models, so Bryson likely used model-specific listwise deletion, but with fewer losses than you have).

**Mismatch B: Fit statistics (R², Adj. R²)**
- **Generated:**  
  - Model 1 R²=0.121; Adj R²=0.096  
  - Model 2 R²=0.130; Adj R²=0.103  
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R²=0.145; Adj R²=0.129  
  - Model 2 R²=0.147; Adj R²=0.130  
**Fix:** Once you match (i) sample, (ii) weighting, and (iii) variable construction/coding, R² should move toward the published values.

**Mismatch C: You present “standard errors” requirement vs. what the true table contains**
- The **true Table 2 does not report SEs** at all. Your generated tables also do not show SEs—only stars—so you cannot “match SEs” to Table 2.
**Fix:** Either:
- remove SE comparisons entirely (since Table 2 doesn’t provide them), or
- compute SEs in your replication but clearly label them as “replication output (not in Bryson table).”

**Mismatch D: Intercept/constant treatment**
- **True:** says coefficients are standardized, yet includes a constant (2.415***; 7.860). Intercepts are **not standardized**; Bryson is reporting *standardized slopes* plus an *unstandardized intercept*.
- **Generated:** you label constant as “intercept (unstandardized)”—that part is conceptually fine, but your intercept values are wrong (see below).
**Fix:** Keep the intercept unstandardized; standardize only predictors (and possibly DV depending on method—see below).

---

### 2) Variable name / DV definition mismatches

**Mismatch E: DV names match, but your DV variables differ operationally**
- **Generated DV variables:** `dv_minority_linked`, `dv_remaining`
- **True DV labels:** “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” and “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”
**Fix:** Ensure `dv_minority_linked` is **exactly** the mean/sum index Bryson used:
- same genre list,
- same coding direction (higher = more dislike),
- same scaling (e.g., 1–5 vs 0–?),
- same handling of “don’t know,” “never heard,” missing,
- and same rule for minimum answered items before computing an index.

A big red flag is your analytic sample shows DV values like **6.0** for minority-linked and values up to **12.0** for remaining—this suggests you might be using a **count** of disliked genres rather than the **scale/index** Bryson used (or you’re summing binary indicators). Bryson’s intercepts (2.415; 7.860) also suggest specific DV scaling—your intercepts are far from those.

**Mismatch F: Racism score sign in Model 2**
- **Generated Model 2:** Racism score = **-0.039**  
- **True Model 2:** Racism score = **+0.080**  
**Fix:** This is usually caused by one (or more) of:
1) racism scale reverse-coded (higher = less racist vs more racist),  
2) DV reverse-coded (higher = less dislike / more liking),  
3) standardization performed incorrectly (e.g., standardizing after reversing in one model but not the other),  
4) using different items for racism scale or different missingness rules across models.

Make sure:
- racism_score is coded so **higher = more racist sentiment** (as in Bryson),
- DV is coded so **higher = more dislike**,
- and you compute standardized betas from the same underlying unstandardized model.

### 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 1)

True Model 1 coefficients vs Generated Model 1:

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.134** | 0.130** | close (minor) |
| Education | -0.206*** | -0.175*** | too negative |
| Household income per capita | +0.033 | -0.037 | **wrong sign** |
| Occupational prestige | +0.010 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.076 | -0.057 | magnitude off |
| Age | 0.144** | 0.163*** | sig level & magnitude off |
| Black | -0.080 | -0.132*** | far smaller, loses sig |
| Hispanic | -0.115* | -0.058 | too negative + wrong sig |
| Other race | +0.002 | -0.017 | wrong sign (small) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.089 | 0.063 | too large |
| No religion | 0.067 | 0.057 | close-ish |
| Southern | -0.021 | 0.024 | **wrong sign** |
| Constant | 2.560*** | 2.415*** | off |

**Fixes for Model 1 mismatches:**
- **Income, prestige, Southern sign flips** strongly suggest **coding/recoding differences** (e.g., South coded 0/1 reversed; income not per capita or logged; prestige scale different direction).
- **Black coefficient much smaller and not significant** suggests race coding differs (e.g., reference category not “White,” or you included only nonwhite subsample, or you used different dummies).
- **Age significance differs**: likely N/weights differences or DV scaling differences.
- **Intercept**: indicates your DV scale is not the same as Bryson’s (and/or you standardized DV when you shouldn’t).

### 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 2)

True Model 2 coefficients vs Generated Model 2:

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.039 | 0.080 | **wrong sign** |
| Education | -0.217*** | -0.242*** | too small in magnitude |
| Household income per capita | -0.031 | -0.065 | too small |
| Occupational prestige | -0.029 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.076 | -0.070 | close |
| Age | 0.112* | 0.126** | sig level & magnitude off |
| Black | 0.074 | 0.042 | too large |
| Hispanic | 0.001 | -0.029 | wrong sign (small) |
| Other race | 0.078 | 0.047 | too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.117* | 0.048 | **far too large + wrong sig** |
| No religion | 0.016 | 0.024 | close-ish |
| Southern | 0.079 | 0.069 | close-ish |
| Constant | 5.479*** | 7.860 | **far off** (and Bryson shows no stars here) |

**Fixes for Model 2 mismatches:**
- Racism sign flip again points to **scale direction** or DV direction.
- Prestige wrong sign again points to **prestige coding**.
- Conservative Protestant being much larger and significant for you but not in Bryson strongly suggests:
  - different **religion classification** (who counts as conservative Protestant),
  - different reference group (e.g., you used “mainline Protestant” vs “all others”),
  - or weighting/sample differences.

### 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches

**Mismatch G: Significance stars don’t match**
Examples:
- Model 1: **Age** is *** in true but only ** in generated.
- Model 1: **Black** is *** in true but none in generated.
- Model 2: **Racism** has no stars in true and none in generated, but your coefficient is negative (interpretation mismatch).
- Model 2: **Conservative Protestant** has no stars in true but * in generated.

**Fix:** Because significance depends on SEs and N/weights, to match the stars you must match:
1) sample N and missingness handling,  
2) weights and design correction (if any),  
3) exact variable coding and scaling,  
4) OLS specification (no extra covariates, no interactions).

Also note: Bryson’s stars are based on the paper’s tests; if Bryson used survey-adjusted SEs and you used naive OLS SEs (or vice versa), stars will differ even with identical betas.

### 6) Specific likely coding/specification errors to check (high-yield)

To make your generated analysis match Bryson Table 2, audit these in order:

1) **DV construction**
   - Confirm you’re using the same **index** (mean vs sum vs count), same number of genres, same response scale, and same missing-data rule.
   - Your DVs looking like integers up to 6 and 12 suggests you may be using **counts** (0–6, 0–12). That is very likely *not* what the table used.

2) **Income per capita**
   - Ensure it is truly **household income per capita** (income / household size), not raw household income.
   - Confirm whether Bryson used logged income or not (table label says per capita; coefficient signs/magnitudes depend on this).

3) **Region (Southern)**
   - Verify coding: 1=South, 0=non-South. Your Model 1 sign is reversed vs true.

4) **Occupational prestige**
   - Make sure it matches the prestige scale used (e.g., NORC, Duncan SEI, etc.) and that higher = higher prestige (not reversed).

5) **Race dummies + reference category**
   - Use White as the omitted category, and create dummies exactly for Black, Hispanic, Other race as Bryson does.
   - Ensure Hispanic is treated consistently (ethnicity vs race). A common mismatch: coding Hispanic as a race category vs ethnicity-first coding.

6) **Religion categories**
   - Replicate Bryson’s definition of “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion,” and the omitted group (likely “all others,” often including mainline Protestant + Catholic + Jewish + other).
   - If you instead used a different religious typology, coefficients won’t match.

7) **Standardized coefficients**
   - Bryson’s slopes are standardized. Make sure you are outputting **standardized betas**, not unstandardized b’s.
   - Best practice: estimate OLS on unstandardized variables, then compute standardized betas as:  
     \[
     \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
     \]
     using the same analytic sample as the regression.

8) **Weights / survey design**
   - If Bryson used weights, apply them. If Bryson used survey-adjusted SEs, use the same design info; otherwise, stars won’t match.

### 7) “How to fix the generated analysis so it matches” (action checklist)

1) Rebuild both DVs to match Bryson’s exact procedure (genre list, coding, scaling, missingness).  
2) Recompute `racism_score` so higher values correspond to the same direction as Bryson.  
3) Recode `southern` so 1=South.  
4) Verify `income_pc` truly equals household income / household size (and matches Bryson’s units).  
5) Verify `occ_prestige` scale and direction.  
6) Recreate race/ethnicity dummies with the same reference category (White).  
7) Recreate religion dummies with Bryson’s definitions and the same omitted category.  
8) Match Bryson’s model-specific listwise deletion to get N=644 and N=605 (or otherwise identify why your N is smaller).  
9) Apply the same weighting/design strategy as the paper.  
10) Output: standardized betas + unstandardized intercept, plus R²/Adj R² and N exactly as in Table 2; do **not** claim SEs are in the table.

If you paste your variable coding rules (especially how you built both DV indices and racism_score, and how you defined conservative Protestant), I can pinpoint which recodes are causing each sign flip.
