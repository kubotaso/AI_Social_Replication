### 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

**A. Missing predictors in the generated tables**
- **True tables include:** `Hispanic` and `No religion`.
- **Generated tables include:** neither `Hispanic` nor `No religion` as rows.
- **Generated fit tables claim:** `dropped_predictors_post_listwise = no_religion`, implying it *existed* but was dropped.
- **Mismatch:** In the published Table 2, *No religion is not “dropped”*; it is estimated and reported with a coefficient in both models. Likewise, *Hispanic is reported* in both models but is absent from the generated results.

**How to fix**
- Ensure the model specification includes **both** `Hispanic` and `No religion` and that they survive the exact same sample restrictions as the paper.
- Don’t label a predictor as “dropped post-listwise” if the paper’s table reports it. Instead:
  - replicate the paper’s missing-data handling (likely listwise deletion on *all* model variables), and
  - report the coefficient for `No religion` and `Hispanic`.

**B. “Other race” meaning is inconsistent**
- **True table has both:** `Black`, `Hispanic`, and `Other race` (so “Other race” is *net of* Black and Hispanic).
- **Generated table has:** `Black` and `Other race` but no `Hispanic`.
- **Mismatch:** Without `Hispanic`, your `Other race` dummy absorbs Hispanics (unless coded otherwise), so it is not the same variable as in the paper.

**How to fix**
- Recreate mutually exclusive race/ethnicity dummies exactly as in the paper:
  - reference category likely **White non-Hispanic**
  - include `Black`, `Hispanic`, `Other race` simultaneously.

#### Model A (paper “Model 1”)
True N=644, R²=.145, Adj R²=.129

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.005 | 0.080 | wrong sign and far off |
| Education | -0.224 | -0.242 | moderately off |
| Household income per capita | -0.095 | -0.065 | too negative |
| Occupational prestige | -0.012 | 0.005 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.091 | -0.070 | magnitude off |
| Age | 0.091 | 0.126 | too small; sig differs |
| Black | 0.112 | 0.042 | much too large |
| Other race | 0.132 | 0.047 | much too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.080 | 0.048 | too large |
| Southern | 0.142 | 0.069 | much too large |
| **Hispanic** | (missing) | -0.029 | omitted |
| **No religion** | (missing) | 0.024 | omitted |
| Constant | 5.674 | 7.860 | different |

**How to fix coefficient mismatches**
These are not small rounding differences; they indicate you are **not reproducing the same model/data**. To align with the paper you must replicate:

1. **Exact sample year and filters**  
   Paper: **GSS 1993**. Your N’s (327/308) are about half the true N’s (644/605). That alone will change coefficients and significance.

2. **Exact dependent variables**  
   Paper Model 1 DV: *count of disliked genres among 6 “Black/Hispanic-liked” genres*  
   Paper Model 2 DV: *count of disliked genres among remaining 12 genres*  
   If you used different genre lists, different coding of “disliked,” or a different denominator, coefficients will shift.

3. **Exact coding of predictors**  
   - “Racism score” must match Bryson’s constructed scale (items, direction, missing handling, standardization).
   - Race/ethnicity dummies must match the table (include Hispanic separately).
   - “No religion” must be included (and coded the same way).

4. **Standardization method**  
   The table reports “standardized OLS coefficients.” If you standardized variables differently (e.g., standardized DV but not X’s; used sample-weighted SD; used complete-case SD vs full-sample SD), you’ll get different betas.

### 3) Standard errors / p-values / significance markers: interpretation errors

**A. You report p-values and stars as if they come from the paper**
- **True:** Table 2 **does not report SEs** and therefore does not provide enough information to recover p-values from the table alone.
- **Generated:** provides `p_value_replication` and stars.

**Mismatch**
- You are implicitly treating your computed p-values as if they are “replicating” the paper’s significance, but the paper’s stars come from *their* estimation on *their* analytic sample (N=644/605), not yours (N=327/308).

**How to fix**
- Either:
  1) **Remove SE/p-value columns** when presenting “paper table replication” unless you truly replicate the original microdata and model; or  
  2) Keep p-values but **label them clearly** as “from our re-estimation” and only compare stars once N/model match.

**B. Several significance markers differ from the paper**
Examples:
- Model A:
  - **Racism score**: true `0.130**`; generated shows `0.139 *` (wrong star level).
  - **Black**: true `-0.132***`; generated `-0.127 *` (very wrong).
- Model B:
  - **Age**: true `0.126**`; generated has no star.
  - **Southern**: true `0.069` (no star); generated `0.142 **`.

**How to fix**
- First fix **sample, DV construction, and covariate set** (most star mismatches will disappear once the model is actually the same).
- Confirm whether Bryson used **weights**; weights can affect SEs (and sometimes coefficients if weighted standardization is used).

### 4) Fit statistics mismatches (N, R², adjusted R², k)

**A. N is wrong**
- **Generated ModelA_fit N=327** vs **True N=644**
- **Generated ModelB_fit N=308** vs **True N=605**

**How to fix**
- Use GSS 1993 and reproduce the paper’s inclusion criteria and missing-data handling.
- Avoid dropping half the sample via an unintended restriction (e.g., requiring non-missing on variables you shouldn’t include, restricting to a subset, mis-merging, or dropping “Don’t know” incorrectly).

**B. R² and adjusted R² don’t match**
- Model A: generated R²=.190 vs true .145
- Model B: generated R²=.166 vs true .147

**How to fix**
- These will align only after you replicate:
  - the DV construction,
  - the predictor set (including Hispanic & No religion),
  - the same analytic sample (N),
  - and the same standardization/weighting decisions.

**C. k_predictors_included inconsistent with what’s shown**
- Generated says `k_predictors_included=10`, and the table displays 10 predictors (excluding constant).  
- But the true model includes **12 predictors** (Racism + 11 covariates) if you count: Education, Income, Prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern.

**How to fix**
- Add `Hispanic` and `No religion` so k matches the published specification (and don’t “drop” them).

---

### 5) Constant / unstandardized coefficient column problems

**A. You have `b_unstd = NaN` for all predictors**
- Yet the paper table is a *standardized-coefficient* table; it does include a constant, but the other coefficients are standardized.

**Mismatch**
- Presenting an unstandardized column full of NaNs is a reporting error and confuses what is being replicated.

**How to fix**
- Either:
  - remove the `b_unstd` column entirely for a “paper-style standardized table,” or
  - compute and report unstandardized coefficients properly from the same model fit (but then you’re no longer matching Table 2’s format).

**B. Constant differs**
- Model A constant: generated 2.654 vs true 2.415
- Model B constant: generated 5.674 vs true 7.860

**How to fix**
- Constants are sensitive to DV coding (and sample). Once DV and N match, constants should get much closer. Also verify whether the DV is an **additive count** with the same minimum/maximum as Bryson’s.

### Summary of what you need to change to make the generated analysis match the true results

1. **Use the correct dataset/subset:** GSS **1993**, same eligibility rules; fix whatever caused N to halve.
2. **Reconstruct DVs exactly** (6-genre dislike count for Model 1; remaining-12 dislike count for Model 2).
3. **Include the full covariate list**: add `Hispanic` and `No religion`; ensure race dummies are mutually exclusive with white non-Hispanic reference.
4. **Match standardization and any weights** used to compute standardized betas.
5. **Report formatting to match Table 2:** standardized coefficients + stars; do not invent SEs from the PDF table; only include p-values/SEs if you truly re-estimated from microdata and label them accordingly.

If you share your codebook for the race/religion coding and how you built the two DV counts, I can pinpoint which specific coding choice most likely produced the big sign flips (e.g., racism score in Model B, occupational prestige in both models, and “Other race”).
