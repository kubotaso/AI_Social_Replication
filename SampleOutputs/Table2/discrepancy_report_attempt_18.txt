Score: 20/100
============================================================

### 1) Sample size / analytic sample (major mismatch)

**Mismatch**
- **Generated**: Model A **N=261**, Model B **N=259**.
- **True (Bryson 1996 Table 2)**: Model 1 **N=644**, Model 2 **N=605**.

**Why this happened**
- Your generated pipeline is dropping huge fractions of cases due to missingness, especially:
  - `racism_score` **47.6% missing**
  - `cons_prot` **36.3% missing**
  - DV missingness **29–34%**
  - `hispanic` **22.3% missing**
- Plus, the diagnostics show `no_religion` has **only 1 unique value** in the analytic sample (so it was dropped), which is a telltale sign the sample has been distorted by listwise deletion.

**Fix**
- To match the paper, you must replicate **their case inclusion rules**. Concretely:
  1. **Recreate variables using the same source year and same coding** as Bryson (almost certainly GSS with far more than ~260 cases after restrictions).
  2. Use the same missing-data handling as the paper. Table 2’s Ns (644/605) strongly suggest **not** dropping ~50% of cases because racism items are missing. Options:
     - Rebuild `racism_score` so it is **available for many more respondents** (e.g., the correct racism items/year; or allow partial scoring consistent with the paper rather than “strict sum of 5 dichotomies”).
     - Verify whether Bryson uses **a specific year pooled sample** (or multiple years) and not just “1993”.
  3. Confirm whether Bryson used **weights** (GSS typically uses WTSSALL/WTSS) and whether weights affect effective N vs reported N (reported N is usually unweighted count, but you must match their filtering).

### 2) Variable name / definition mismatches (coding discrepancies)

#### 2a) Racism score definition
**Mismatch**
- **Generated label**: “Racism score (0–5; strict sum of 5 dichotomies)”
- **True**: “Racism score” (no mention of strict dichotomies; and coefficients differ across both models)

**Fix**
- Use **exactly the racism battery/items** Bryson used and the same scoring (including treatment of DK/NA and whether items were dichotomized).
- Your “strict sum” + very high missingness is inconsistent with Table 2’s large N.

#### 2b) Hispanic variable construction
**Mismatch**
- **Generated**: `Hispanic (from ETHNIC==1 if present; else missing)`
- **True**: “Hispanic” appears with coefficients in both models, implying it exists broadly in the analytic sample.
- Your version creates **extra missingness** (22%), likely not how Bryson coded it.

**Fix**
- Code Hispanic using the paper’s operationalization (often GSS `HISPANIC` or derived from race/ethnic origin in a way that does **not** set most people to missing).
- Typically: if not Hispanic, code 0 rather than missing, unless the paper explicitly excludes unknowns.

#### 2c) Conservative Protestant proxy
**Mismatch**
- **Generated**: “proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1; missing retained” with **36% missing**.
- **True**: “Conservative Protestant” with a coefficient reported; missingness that large would crush N, which didn’t happen in the paper.

**Fix**
- Use the standard GSS religious tradition classification (e.g., Steensland et al. / RELTRAD) or Bryson’s specific coding.
- Don’t rely on a single `DENOM==1` rule; that’s almost certainly wrong.
- Also “missing retained” is not what your actual analytic frame shows—because N collapses anyway. Make “retained” real by coding missing to 0 only if that matches Bryson (often it wouldn’t).

#### 2d) No religion
**Mismatch**
- **Generated**: `no_religion` is **dropped** (“Dropped_no_variation”) and shown as NaN in the betas table.
- **True**: “No religion” is included with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**

**Fix**
- Ensure `no_religion` varies in the analytic sample:
  - Don’t accidentally subset to only religious respondents.
  - Code from the correct variable (`RELIG` or equivalent) and keep all categories.
  - Avoid listwise deletion that leaves only one category remaining.
- After fixing sample construction, this variable should no longer be constant.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (direction, magnitude, and significance)

Below I compare **Generated standardized betas** vs **True standardized betas**.

#### Model 1 (minority-linked genres)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.143* | 0.130** | sig level differs |
| Education | -0.260*** | -0.175*** | magnitude too large |
| Income pc | -0.013 | -0.037 | magnitude too small |
| Prestige | 0.057 | -0.020 | **sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.035 | -0.057 | magnitude differs |
| Age | 0.174** | 0.163*** | sig differs |
| Black | -0.200 | -0.132*** | sig + magnitude differ |
| Hispanic | 0.030 | -0.058 | **sign wrong** |
| Other race | -0.005 | -0.017 | small diff |
| Cons Prot | 0.118 | 0.063 | magnitude differs |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | 0.057 | **missing variable** |
| Southern | -0.060 | 0.024 | **sign wrong** |
| Constant | 2.600*** | 2.415*** | differs |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.178 / 0.142 | 0.145 / 0.129 | differs |
| N | 261 | 644 | **massive** |

#### Model 2 (remaining genres)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.009 | 0.080 | **sign wrong** |
| Education | -0.165* | -0.242*** | magnitude + sig wrong |
| Income pc | -0.079 | -0.065 | close-ish |
| Prestige | -0.083 | 0.005 | **sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.084 | -0.070 | close-ish |
| Age | 0.125 | 0.126** | sig missing |
| Black | 0.025 | 0.042 | close-ish |
| Hispanic | 0.018 | -0.029 | **sign wrong** |
| Other race | 0.124* | 0.047 | magnitude/sig wrong |
| Cons Prot | 0.141* | 0.048 | magnitude/sig wrong |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | 0.024 | **missing variable** |
| Southern | 0.101 | 0.069 | differs |
| Constant | 5.198*** | 7.860 | **big mismatch** |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.151 / 0.113 | 0.147 / 0.130 | differs |
| N | 259 | 605 | **massive** |

**Fix (for coefficient alignment)**
These coefficient sign flips and magnitude distortions are exactly what you’d expect from:
- wrong sample (N collapse + selection)
- wrong variable definitions (Hispanic, Southern, prestige coding, racism index)
- different model specification (maybe you standardized differently, or used different DV construction)

To fix:
1. **Rebuild the DVs exactly** as Bryson did (the counts and inclusion of “dislike” must match the GSS coding and the paper’s definition).
2. **Use the same independent variable codings** (esp. racism, Hispanic, region, religion tradition).
3. **Use the same estimation choices**:
   - OLS with standardized coefficients (beta weights). Make sure you’re standardizing the same way (typically z-scoring X and Y before OLS or computing betas from unstandardized coefficients).
   - Confirm whether Bryson used **weights**; weights can shift coefficients.

### 4) Standard errors: category error in comparison

**Mismatch**
- **Generated**: you ask to compare **standard errors**, but your “Generated Results” table shows only:
  - `ModelA_Std_Beta`, `ModelA_Replication_Sig`, etc.
  - **No SEs are displayed.**
- **True**: Table 2 **does not report SEs** at all.

**Fix**
- If you want to “match the paper,” **do not report SEs** (or at least don’t claim you matched them).
- If you want to validate inference, compute t-stats/p-values in your replication, but then you must note: **“SEs not reported in Bryson (1996); significance stars are compared.”**

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by signs (substantive errors)

Because several coefficients flip signs relative to the true table, any narrative interpretation would be wrong. Key examples:

- **Southern**
  - True Model 1: **+0.024** (slightly more dislike)
  - Generated Model 1: **-0.060** (less dislike)
- **Hispanic**
  - True Model 1: **-0.058** (less dislike)
  - Generated Model 1: **+0.030** (more dislike)
- **Racism score in Model 2**
  - True: **+0.080**
  - Generated: **-0.009**

**Fix**
- Do not interpret until the **coding and sample** match; otherwise you’re interpreting artifacts of mismeasurement and selection.

---

### 6) Constant and DV scale inconsistency

**Mismatch**
- True constants: **2.415*** (Model 1), **7.860** (Model 2)
- Generated constants: **2.600*** (Model 1), **5.198*** (Model 2)

**Fix**
- This suggests your DV counts (0–6 and 0–12) might not be coded identically to the paper (e.g., which genres included, what counts as “dislike,” how missing responses handled).
- Reconstruct DV exactly (same genres, same dislike threshold, same handling of neutral/unknown).

---

## Bottom line: what to change so the generated analysis matches Bryson (1996)

1. **Use the correct dataset/year(s)/pooling** so N is on the order of **600+**, not ~260.
2. **Recode racism_score** to match Bryson’s index and **avoid “strict sum” that induces 48% missingness**.
3. **Recode Hispanic** so non-Hispanic is coded 0 (not missing) unless the paper says otherwise.
4. **Recode Conservative Protestant** using the same religious tradition classification as the paper (not RELIG==1 & DENOM==1).
5. Fix `no_religion` so it varies and is included.
6. **Rebuild DVs** to match the paper’s dislike measures and missing handling.
7. Only then compare standardized coefficients and significance stars; **do not compare SEs** to the paper because they aren’t provided.

If you paste the code (or at least the exact variable construction steps you used for racism, the two DVs, Hispanic, and cons_prot), I can point to the exact lines that create each mismatch and give corrected pseudocode.
