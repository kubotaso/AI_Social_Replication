Score: 16/100
============================================================

Below is a point-by-point audit of **every mismatch** between the Generated Results and Bryson (1996) Table 2 “true” results, plus concrete fixes to make the generated analysis match the published table.

---

## 1) Sample size (N) is wrong in both models

### Mismatch
- **True Model 1 N = 644**; **Generated Model 1 N = 309**
- **True Model 2 N = 605**; **Generated Model 2 N = 305**

This is not a small discrepancy; it implies the generated pipeline is discarding ~50% of cases.

### Likely cause (from your own diagnostics)
Your **racism_score missingness is ~0.373** and **cons_prot missingness ~0.363**. With listwise deletion plus additional missingness on the DV(s), the analytic N collapses to ~309/305. The paper’s N (644/605) indicates Bryson is **not listwise-deleting on a composite that is missing for ~37%**, or he used a different missing-data strategy/construct.

### How to fix
To match the paper, you must replicate the **paper’s construction of racism score and religion variables and missing-data treatment**. Common possibilities:

1) **Construct racism score with partial information** (e.g., mean of available items if at least k items answered), instead of requiring all items:
- Current: racism_score is missing if any racism items missing (drives 37% missing).
- Fix: compute racism_score as row-mean of non-missing items, requiring e.g. ≥3 of 5 items.

2) **Use the same imputation/handling as the paper** (if Bryson used imputation or coded DK/NA differently).
- If “DK/NA” were recoded to the midpoint (or to 0) in the original analysis, your NA coding will diverge drastically.

3) **Ensure identical universe / filters** (1993 GSS? music module respondents?).
- Your descriptives show DV available N=1134/1057, but the paper uses 644/605 after controls—so the “true” analysis still drops people, just not as aggressively as yours. That suggests **your predictor missingness is too high**, especially racism_score and cons_prot.

Bottom line: you cannot match coefficients or R² until you replicate the **same analytic sample definition**.

---

## 2) R² and adjusted R² do not match

### Mismatch
**Model 1**
- True: R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**
- Generated: R² = **0.189**, Adj R² = **0.159**

**Model 2**
- True: R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**
- Generated: R² = **0.156**, Adj R² = **0.125**

### Interpretation problem
The generated writeup would overstate explained variance for Model 1 (0.189 vs 0.145). This is consistent with using a different sample (N=309) and/or different variable construction.

### How to fix
Once you fix the sample (Section 1), R² should move substantially. Also verify:
- OLS with intercept
- same set of predictors
- same coding (especially race/religion region)
- standardized betas computed after the final analytic sample is set

---

## 3) Constant/intercept values do not match (and Model 2 constant is wildly off)

### Mismatch
- **True Model 1 Constant = 2.415***; Generated = **2.590695*** (off)
- **True Model 2 Constant = 7.860**; Generated = **5.549442*** (very off)

### Why this matters
Even with standardized betas, the **constant is unstandardized** and is sensitive to:
- DV construction (sum vs mean, range)
- centering/scaling of DV
- sample composition

Your DV descriptives show Model 2 DV has max 12 and mean ~3.77, so an intercept of 7.86 seems high unless the paper’s DV is constructed differently (e.g., different scaling or coding direction).

### How to fix
Recreate the DV exactly as Bryson did:
- confirm whether “dislike” is coded 0/1 vs 1/2 vs 1–5, etc.
- confirm whether the DV is a **count of “dislikes”** across genres, or a sum of scale items, and how “neutral/like” were coded
- confirm inclusion/exclusion of “don’t know” responses
- confirm that Model 2 DV is exactly “12 remaining genres” and not a different set than your 18-item list (you show 18 items in `item_missingness_music`)

Until DV construction matches, constants will not match, and neither will coefficients.

---

## 4) Variable name / presence mismatches: “No religion” is missing (NaN) in generated output

### Mismatch
- **True Table 2 includes “No religion” with coefficients**:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**
- Generated output shows **No religion = NaN** in both models and flags `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion`.

### Why this is a discrepancy
In your data, `quickcheck_key_indicators_counts` shows:
- no_religion = 0 (1451), 1 (146), nan (9)

So it *does* vary. If it was dropped, it’s because it became constant **after listwise deletion** (e.g., everyone with complete data happens to have no_religion=0) or because of a coding/model-matrix error.

### How to fix
- First fix the analytic sample (Section 1), because listwise deletion may have eliminated nearly all “no religion = 1” cases.
- Then ensure `no_religion` is included correctly:
  - If you have religion dummies, avoid perfect multicollinearity. Use a clear reference category and include only k−1 dummies.
  - Ensure you did not accidentally create `no_religion` only for missing religion cases.
- Verify after filtering that `no_religion` still has both 0 and 1.

## 5) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas) — Model 1 (every mismatch)

True vs Generated (Model 1 DV = minority-linked 6 genres):

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.168** | Too large |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.281*** | Much too negative |
| Income pc | -0.037 | -0.030 | Close but not same |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | +0.077 | Wrong sign |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.026 | Too small (attenuated) |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.169** | Similar magnitude but wrong sig level |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.155 (ns) | Missing significance + magnitude difference |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | +0.024 | Wrong sign |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.003 | Too close to zero |
| Cons Prot | 0.063 | 0.068 | Close |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN | Missing variable |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.047 | Wrong sign |

### How to fix (Model 1 betas)
These are exactly what you’d expect when:
- the **sample is different** (N 309 vs 644),
- the **DV construction differs**, and/or
- race/religion/region coding differs.

So the fix is not “tweak one coefficient”; it’s:
1) match the DV and predictor construction
2) match the analytic sample size and eligibility
3) rerun and compute standardized betas the same way as the paper (standardize using the analytic sample SDs)

---

## 6) Coefficient mismatches — Model 2 (many mismatches)

True vs Generated (Model 2 DV = 12 remaining genres):

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | 0.040 | Too small |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.234*** | Close |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.053 | Somewhat off |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.019 | Wrong sign (though small) |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.075 | Close |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.079 (ns) | Too small + wrong significance |
| Black | 0.042 | -0.038 | Wrong sign |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | +0.138 | Wrong sign and huge |
| Other race | 0.047 | +0.093 | Too large |
| Cons Prot | 0.048 | 0.126* | Too large + wrong sig |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN | Missing variable |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.099 | Larger than true |

### How to fix (Model 2 betas)
Again, these are consistent with:
- wrong analytic sample (305 vs 605),
- wrong coding for race (especially Hispanic/Black),
- wrong DV composition (which items go into “remaining 12”),
- or different treatment of missingness and “don’t know” answers.

## 7) Significance/interpretation mismatches (stars do not match the paper)

### Mismatch examples
- Model 1 Age: **True 0.163*** but Generated shows **0.169** with only ** (not ***)
- Model 1 Black: True has *** but Generated has no stars
- Model 2 Age: True has **, Generated has none
- Model 2 Conservative Protestant: True has no star, Generated has *

### Why it happens
Significance depends on:
- N (yours is ~half)
- residual variance (different DV)
- exact predictor coding
- whether you used robust SEs vs classical OLS
But note: **the paper does not report SEs**, only stars. Your stars should be computed with the same test assumptions as Bryson (likely conventional OLS SEs, two-tailed).

### How to fix
After matching sample + variables:
- use plain OLS (unless the paper explicitly uses robust)
- compute p-values two-tailed
- apply the same thresholds: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001

---

## 8) DV construction mismatch is strongly indicated (especially Model 2)

### Evidence in your output
- You list **18 music items** in `item_missingness_music` (rap, reggae, blues, jazz, gospel, latin + 12 others = 18). That seems right in count, but the paper’s constant (7.860) vs your mean (~3.78) suggests your “dislike” definition might be stricter/looser or reversed.

### How to fix
Audit and align:
- Which response categories count as “dislike”? (e.g., “dislike a lot” only vs both “dislike” and “dislike a lot”)
- Are you treating missing as 0? (should not)
- Are you summing binary indicators or using original ordinal scales?
- Are the same genres included in the “remaining 12” as in the paper’s GSS year/module?

---

## 9) Race/ethnicity coding appears inconsistent with the paper

### Evidence
- Model 2: **Black sign flips** (true +0.042, generated −0.038)
- Model 1: **Hispanic sign flips** (true −0.058, generated +0.024)
- Model 2: Hispanic becomes very large positive (+0.138), inconsistent with paper (−0.029)

### How to fix
- Verify reference category: typically White non-Hispanic as reference, with dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other.
- Ensure Hispanic is not overlapping with race dummies (e.g., Hispanic respondents also coded as White/Black in race variable, causing mis-specified design).
- Use mutually exclusive categories matching the paper’s coding scheme.

---

## Summary: what to change so the generated analysis matches Table 2

1) **Rebuild racism_score to reduce missingness** in the same way as Bryson (likely partial-item averaging or different missing coding). Your current approach yields 37% missing and collapses N.
2) **Recreate both DVs exactly** (which genres, which dislike threshold, how to treat DK/NA).
3) **Fix religion dummy specification** so “No religion” is not dropped and the reference group matches the paper.
4) **Fix race/Hispanic coding** to match mutually exclusive categories used in the paper.
5) **Use the same analytic sample definition** (should yield N=644 and N=605).
6) Recompute **standardized betas** from the final matched analytic samples; then apply the same p-value thresholds for stars.

If you share (a) your exact coding rules for the two DVs and racism_score, and (b) the regression formula/model matrix (including reference categories), I can pinpoint which single step is driving each sign flip (especially Hispanic/Black and Southern) rather than attributing it broadly to “sample differences.”
