Score: 12/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / model-label mismatches

**Mismatch A: Model naming (“model_2A/2B” vs paper’s Model 1/Model 2)**
- **Generated:** `beta_model_2A` and `beta_model_2B`
- **True:** Table 2 has **Model 1** (DV = dislike of minority-linked genres) and **Model 2** (DV = dislike of remaining 12 genres).
- **Fix:** Rename your outputs to match the paper:
  - `model_2A` → **Model 1**
  - `model_2B` → **Model 2**
  - And rename DVs to exactly those descriptions (or at least DV1/DV2 with correct mapping).

**Mismatch B: Missing predictors in generated table**
- **Generated:** appears to list **10** coefficients per model.
- **True:** each model reports **12 predictors** (Racism, Education, Income pc, Occ prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern) + Constant.
- **Fix:** Ensure all covariates are included in the regression and printed. Common causes:
  - Dropped variables due to missingness (listwise deletion) or recoding to NA
  - Accidentally excluding religion or region dummies from the model formula
  - Collapsing race into fewer categories than the paper (e.g., omitting “Other race”)

**Mismatch C: Variable label mismatch: “minority_linked_6” and “remaining_12”**
- **Generated DV labels:** `dv1_dislike_minority_linked_6`, `dv2_dislike_remaining_12`
- **True DV wording:** “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” and “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres.”
- **Fix:** This is mostly cosmetic, but verify that your DV construction exactly matches the paper’s genre sets (same genres, same coding direction, same scaling).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (value and sign), by predictor

Because the generated table doesn’t show variable names, the only way to compare is to assume the rows are in the usual Table 2 order (Racism, Education, Income, Prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern). Under that assumption, **nearly every coefficient is wrong**.

#### Model 1 (paper) vs generated “model_2A”
Paper (Model 1) coefficients:  
Racism 0.130**, Education -0.175***, Income -0.037, Prestige -0.020, Female -0.057, Age 0.163***, Black -0.132***, Hispanic -0.058, Other -0.017, Cons Prot 0.063, No religion 0.057, Southern 0.024.

Generated “model_2A” (10 rows):  
0.146**, -0.266***, -0.048, 0.025, -0.027, 0.210***, -0.133*, 0.010, 0.071, 0.017

**Mismatches:**
- **Education:** generated -0.266 vs true -0.175 (too large in magnitude).
- **Prestige:** generated +0.025 vs true -0.020 (**sign flip**).
- **Female:** generated -0.027 vs true -0.057 (too small in magnitude).
- **Age:** generated 0.210 vs true 0.163 (too large).
- **Black:** coefficient close (-0.133 vs -0.132) but **significance is wrong** (see stars section).
- **Hispanic:** generated ~0.010 vs true -0.058 (**sign flip and magnitude mismatch**).
- **Other race:** generated 0.071 vs true -0.017 (**sign flip**).
- **Religion/South rows:** your last coefficients don’t align with the paper’s 3 remaining predictors because you only have 10 rows (you’re missing 2 predictors), so row-to-variable mapping breaks down.

**Fixes (likely causes):**
- You are not using the same sample, variables, or standardization as the paper (see Sections 4–6 below). Also, missing two predictors indicates the model specification/output is incomplete.

#### Model 2 (paper) vs generated “model_2B”
Paper (Model 2) coefficients:  
Racism 0.080, Education -0.242***, Income -0.065, Prestige 0.005, Female -0.070, Age 0.126**, Black 0.042, Hispanic -0.029, Other 0.047, Cons Prot 0.048, No religion 0.024, Southern 0.069.

Generated “model_2B” (10 rows):  
0.008, -0.205**, -0.098, -0.026, -0.079, 0.132*, 0.092, 0.116*, 0.097, 0.121*

**Mismatches:**
- **Racism:** generated 0.008 vs true 0.080 (way too small).
- **Education:** generated -0.205 vs true -0.242 (too small in magnitude) and **stars differ** (paper: ***, generated: **).
- **Income:** generated -0.098 vs true -0.065 (too negative).
- **Prestige:** generated -0.026 vs true +0.005 (**sign flip**).
- **Female:** generated -0.079 vs true -0.070 (close).
- **Age:** generated 0.132 vs true 0.126 (close; stars differ: paper **, generated *).
- **Black:** generated 0.092 vs true 0.042 (too large).
- **Hispanic:** generated 0.116 vs true -0.029 (**sign flip**).
- **Other race:** generated 0.097 vs true 0.047 (too large).
- Again, the last rows don’t map cleanly because you’re missing two predictors.

**Fixes:** Same underlying problems: wrong model specification/sample and missing predictors; additionally likely wrong coding of race/ethnicity dummies.

### 3) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation/thresholding)

**Mismatch: Paper stars are based on t-tests in the original analysis, but your stars don’t match.**
Examples:
- Model 1 Black is *** in paper, but only * in generated.
- Model 2 Education is *** in paper, but ** in generated.
- Model 2 Racism has no star in paper (0.080), and you also have none—but the coefficient itself is wrong anyway.

**Fix:**
- If you want to reproduce Bryson’s stars, you must reproduce *their* standard errors/t-stats (even though not printed) by matching:
  - same dataset/version,
  - same weighting (if any),
  - same treatment of missing data,
  - same coding and scaling.
- Also confirm your star cutoffs are exactly (* < .05, ** < .01, *** < .001 two-tailed).

---

### 4) Standard errors: structural mismatch

**Mismatch:** The true table **does not report standard errors**. Your task asks to compare SEs, but the generated output provides none either—so there’s nothing to compare. The real discrepancy is that your workflow seems to assume inferential output comparable to a modern regression table, but Bryson prints only standardized betas + significance marks.

**Fix options:**
1. **To match the paper:** suppress SEs entirely and report only standardized betas + stars (derived from your model).
2. **If you must show SEs:** you can compute them, but then your table will *not* match the published table (because the paper didn’t show them). In that case label clearly: “SEs computed from replication model; not shown in Bryson (1996).”

---

### 5) Fit statistics and N mismatches

**Mismatch A: N**
- **Generated:** N = 340 (DV1), 326 (DV2)
- **True:** N = 644 (Model 1), 605 (Model 2)
- **Fix:** You are using roughly **half** the cases. Common causes:
  - Using a subset (e.g., only one wave, only one group, only complete cases on additional variables not in Bryson)
  - Accidental filtering (e.g., dropping respondents outside a range, dropping missing DV items rather than imputing/averaging as Bryson did)
  - Not using the same survey year/sample

**Mismatch B: R² / Adjusted R²**
- **Generated:** R² ≈ 0.205 and 0.167
- **True:** R² = 0.145 and 0.147
- **Fix:** R² changes because the model/sample differs and/or because you’re not actually reporting standardized OLS in the same way. Once you match the paper’s sample and covariates, R² should move toward the published values.

**Mismatch C: Constant**
- **Generated constants:** 2.656845 and 5.205438
- **True constants:** 2.415*** and 7.860
- **Fix:** Intercepts will not match unless:
  - DV construction matches exactly (scale, averaging vs summing, handling missing items),
  - predictors are coded the same (0/1 dummies, reference categories),
  - and the sample is the same.

---

### 6) DV descriptives: scale/definition mismatch

**Mismatch:** Your DV descriptives show:
- DV1 max = 6, DV2 max = 12, and means 2.06 and 3.78.
This strongly suggests your DV is a **count** (number of genres disliked) ranging 0–6 and 0–12.

But Bryson’s DV appears treated as a **continuous scale** with an intercept like 2.415 and 7.860 (those don’t look like standardized outcomes; they look like unstandardized intercepts tied to a particular coding/scale). The paper labels “dislike of … genres” but does not necessarily mean a simple count; it could be an averaged dislike rating across genres or an index with a different range.

**Fix:**
- Reconstruct the DVs exactly as Bryson did. You need to verify from the paper/methods:
  - Was “dislike” coded from like/dislike questions (binary) and then summed (count), **or**
  - were genres rated on a scale and then averaged/summed, **or**
  - were “dislike” categories defined via a threshold.
- Your intercept for Model 2 (5.205) cannot match 7.860 if your DV is capped at 12 but also potentially using a different scaling/number of items answered.

---

### 7) Coding/reference-category mismatches (race, religion, region)

The sign flips for Hispanic and “Other race” in Model 1 and Model 2 are a red flag for dummy coding problems:
- You may have coded **White = 1** and called it “Black”/“Hispanic”
- Or reversed 0/1 for a dummy
- Or used a different omitted/reference category than the paper
- Or included “Hispanic” as a race category differently (some datasets treat Hispanic as ethnicity separate from race)

**Fix:**
- Verify dummies match the paper:
  - White as reference, and separate indicators for Black, Hispanic, Other (as shown).
- Confirm that “Hispanic” is not simultaneously included inside race coding (avoid double counting).
- Confirm “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” are dummies with the same baseline group as Bryson (likely “other religions”).

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1. **Use the same sample and weighting** as Bryson (1996); stop any accidental filtering; match listwise deletion rules.
2. **Rebuild DV1 and DV2 exactly** as in the paper (not just counts unless that is explicitly what Bryson did).
3. **Include all 12 predictors** shown in Table 2 and print them (your output is missing 2).
4. **Match dummy coding and reference groups** for race and religion; fix sign flips.
5. **Report standardized coefficients** (betas). If you’re currently reporting standardized betas, ensure the standardization procedure matches (standardize predictors only vs both X and Y; regression software differs).
6. **Align model labels and table structure** (Model 1/Model 2; same variable order as the paper).
7. **Recompute stars** using two-tailed p-values with the same df and SE computation; only after the model/specification matches will stars align.

If you paste the code (model formulas + how you constructed the two DVs + how you coded race/religion + any filtering), I can pinpoint exactly which lines are causing (a) the missing predictors and (b) the massive N drop.
