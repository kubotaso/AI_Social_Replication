Score: 16/100
============================================================

### 1) Fundamental construct mismatch: you’re not reproducing Table 2 as reported
**True Table 2 reports only standardized coefficients (betas) + sig markers; it does *not* report SEs, t, p, or unstandardized b.**  
Your generated tables include `b_unstd`, `std_err`, `t`, `p_value` and significance stars derived from those p-values.

**Why this is a discrepancy**
- Any SE/t/p you report **cannot be “compared” to Table 2**, because they are not in the paper’s Table 2.
- Also, your significance stars are therefore **not the paper’s stars** (the paper’s stars reflect the authors’ model; your stars reflect your own computed p-values).

**How to fix**
- To match Table 2, output **only standardized coefficients** (and the paper’s significance markers if you’re copying Table 2).
- If you insist on computing SEs/t/p, you must do it from the *same microdata + same model specification* and then note explicitly: “SEs not reported in Table 2; computed from replication.”

### 2) Sample size (N) mismatch and downstream fit-stat mismatch
**Model A**
- Generated: **N = 453**, R² = **0.1420**, Adj R² = **0.1226**
- True: **N = 644**, R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**

**Model B**
- Generated: **N = 451**, R² = **0.1307**, Adj R² = **0.1109**
- True: **N = 605**, R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**

**How to fix**
- Use the same dataset and same inclusion rules as Bryson (1993 GSS with the authors’ missing-data handling).
- Common causes:
  - You used the wrong year(s) or subset.
  - You listwise-deleted more aggressively (e.g., dropped “don’t know”/“not applicable” differently).
  - You constructed DVs differently (see #5) causing additional missingness.
- Target Ns: **644** (Model 1) and **605** (Model 2). Until N matches, coefficients won’t.

### 3) Predictor set mismatch: “Southern” is missing in your generated models
True Table 2 includes **Southern** in both models:
- Model 1: Southern = **0.024**
- Model 2: Southern = **0.069**

Your generated tables have **10 predictors** (per `k_predictors = 10`) and show **10 non-constant rows**, but **none is Southern**.

**How to fix**
- Add a `southern` dummy coded as in the GSS/paper and include it in both regressions.
- Then you should have **12 predictors** (excluding constant): racism, education, income, prestige, female, age, black, hispanic, other race, conservative protestant, no religion, southern.

Right now you appear to be estimating a different model (omitted-variable bias is possible).

---

### 4) Variable-name/variable-presence mismatches: “No religion” handled incorrectly
Your fit tables say: `dropped_zero_variance_predictors = no_religion`

But in the true Table 2, **No religion is included** and has nonzero coefficients:
- Model 1: **0.057**
- Model 2: **0.024**

**How to fix**
- Your `no_religion` variable became constant (all 0s or all 1s) in your analytic sample. That usually happens if:
  - You filtered to a subgroup where no one has “no religion”
  - You miscoded “no religion” (e.g., treating all missing as 0 and then filtering)
  - You used the wrong source variable (e.g., a religion variable not comparable to the paper)
- Recreate `no_religion` from the same GSS item and coding scheme as Bryson and verify its frequency table **after all filters**.

---

### 5) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas): variable-by-variable comparison

Because your tables do not label rows with variable names, we can only infer order by matching to the paper’s variable order. Assuming your rows correspond to the Table 2 order (racism, education, income, prestige, female, age, black, hispanic, other, conservative Protestant, [no religion], southern), the mismatches are:

#### Model 1 (DV: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”)

| Variable | True beta | Generated `beta_std` | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.123760 | close (sig differs: true **, generated *) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.260882 | too negative by ~-0.086 |
| Income pc | -0.037 | -0.047697 | somewhat more negative |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.073877 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.012048 | much closer to 0 |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.094611 | too small; sig differs (true ***, generated *) |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.152545 | somewhat more negative (sig weaker than true) |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | 0.025073 | wrong sign |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.078896 | wrong sign |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.024764 | too small |
| No religion | 0.057 | **dropped** (and your last row is constant) | missing predictor |
| Southern | 0.024 | **missing** | missing predictor |

**Fixes**
- Add the missing predictors (Southern, No religion) and correct their coding.
- Match sample and DV construction (next section); these are big enough to flip signs (prestige, Hispanic, other).

#### Model 2 (DV: “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”)

| Variable | True beta | Generated `beta_std` | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.001247 | wrong sign, near zero |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.216031 | direction OK, smaller magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.049609 | smaller magnitude |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.038925 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.071442 | close |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.045527 | too small, loses significance |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.055280 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | 0.066770 | wrong sign |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.117890 | too large (and becomes significant) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.124563 | too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | **dropped** | missing predictor |
| Southern | 0.069 | **missing** | missing predictor |

**Fixes**
- Again, add Southern and No religion and correct coding.
- The racism coefficient being ~0 instead of 0.08 suggests your racism scale is constructed differently (or your DV is not the same), or you have heavy selection/missingness changing correlations.

### 6) Unstandardized coefficients and constants: not comparable to Table 2 (and also likely wrong)
- True table provides **standardized betas**; constants shown in the paper (2.415 and 7.860) are on the DV’s original scale, but your constants are **2.7268** and **5.6542**.
- Even if constants are in the same units, they will not match unless:
  1) DV is constructed identically (same genre set, same coding per genre, same handling of missing),
  2) same sample,
  3) same predictors.

**How to fix**
- Reconstruct each DV exactly as Bryson:
  - Model 1 DV: count of disliked among the specific 6 genres listed.
  - Model 2 DV: count of disliked among the “12 remaining genres”.
- Ensure “dislike” is defined identically (e.g., recoding of like/dislike scale; whether “neutral” counts; how DK is treated).
- Only then compare constants.

---

### 7) Interpretation mismatch risk: your significance stars are not the paper’s
Examples:
- Model 1 racism: true ** (p<.01), generated * (p≈.0108).
- Model 1 age: true ***, generated *.
- Model 2 racism: true nonsig positive, generated ~0 negative.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to “match Table 2,” use the paper’s stars and don’t recompute them from your own p-values.
- If the goal is replication, compute p-values from the replication model but then **do not claim** they match Table 2 unless the coefficients and N match.

---

### 8) Presentation/labeling discrepancy: your rows are unlabeled
Your generated coefficient tables do not include a variable-name column, making it impossible to verify alignment.

**How to fix**
- Include a `term`/`variable` column in both model tables and ensure ordering matches the paper exactly.

---

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match the true Table 2
1. **Use 1993 GSS** and the same sample restrictions; match **N=644** and **N=605**.
2. **Construct the two DV counts** exactly as Bryson (which genres; what counts as “dislike”; missing handling).
3. **Construct Racism score** exactly as the paper (items, scaling, reverse-coding, averaging/summing, missing rules).
4. Include **all predictors** in Table 2: add **Southern**; fix **No religion** so it varies and is included.
5. Report **standardized coefficients** as the main output (and optionally add a separate replication table with SE/t/p clearly labeled as not from Table 2).
6. Add explicit **variable names** to every coefficient row.

If you paste your variable construction code (especially the DV definitions and racism scale) and your filtering/missing-data rules, I can pinpoint which step is driving the sign flips (prestige, Hispanic/Other race, racism in Model 2).
