## 1) What the “true” table contains vs what the generated output contains

**True Results (Bryson 1996 Table 2):**
- Reports **standardized OLS coefficients only** (betas) and **significance stars**.
- **Does not report standard errors** (so any SEs in a generated table would be extraneous).
- Uses **N = 644 (Model 1)** and **N = 605 (Model 2)**.
- Reports **R² and Adjusted R²**: (0.145, 0.129) for Model 1; (0.147, 0.130) for Model 2.
- Includes **No religion** with nonzero coefficients in both models.
- Constant for Model 2 shown as **7.860** (and notably no stars in the transcription you provided).

**Generated Results:**
- Also claims standardized betas + stars, but:
  - Uses **N = 261 / 259** (way smaller).
  - Reports different **R²/Adj R²**.
  - **Drops “No religion” due to no variation** and returns NaN.
  - Many coefficients have different signs/magnitudes and different significance.

Conclusion: the generated analysis is not reproducing Table 2; it is a different model run on a different analytic sample with at least one miscoded variable.

## 2) Variable name / specification mismatches

### 2.1 “No religion” incorrectly dropped (major mismatch)
- **Generated:** “No religion (RELIG==4)” is **NaN** and flagged `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion` in both models.
- **True:** “No religion” is included with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**

**How to fix**
- Your `no_religion` dummy is incorrectly constructed **or** your analytic sample restriction inadvertently selects only respondents with the same religion category.
- Checks/fix steps:
  1. Cross-tab before filtering and after filtering:  
     - `tab RELIG` (or equivalent) and `tab no_religion`
  2. Ensure the dummy matches the paper’s definition of “No religion.” It may not be `RELIG==4` in your coding frame; sometimes “none” is a different code or requires combining multiple categories.
  3. Fix sample restrictions so RELIG varies in the analytic sample (see Section 4 on N mismatch).

### 2.2 Conservative Protestant definition likely inconsistent
- **Generated label:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”
- **True variable:** “Conservative Protestant” (as used in the paper)

Your proxy is very likely not Bryson’s operationalization. Conservative Protestant is typically built from **denomination/fundamentalist classification**, not simply `RELIG==1 & DENOM==1` (which may just select a specific denomination or generic Protestant code).

**How to fix**
- Use the same denomination/fundamentalist coding scheme as Bryson (often based on GSS denomination categories grouped into evangelical/fundamentalist vs mainline vs Catholic/Jewish/none).
- At minimum, document and replicate the mapping Bryson used; do not call a proxy “Conservative Protestant” if it’s not the same construct.

### 2.3 Race/ethnicity variable coding mismatch (likely)
- **Generated:** separate dummies for `black`, `hispanic (constructed from ETHNIC)`, `other_race`
- **True:** Black, Hispanic, Other race (but signs differ strongly for Hispanic in Model 1)

The mismatch isn’t just numeric; in Model 1 the **Hispanic sign flips** (true = -0.058; generated = +0.0879). That often indicates:
- wrong reference category,
- wrong coding of Hispanic (e.g., coding “Hispanic ethnicity” incorrectly, or using a different universe),
- or including people coded Hispanic as “white” vs “other,” etc.

**How to fix**
- Reconstruct race/ethnicity exactly as the paper does. Common approach:
  - Race categories mutually exclusive: White (reference), Black, Hispanic, Other.
- Ensure Hispanic is not double-counted with race (e.g., Hispanic respondents also coded as white/black unless you explicitly override race with ethnicity).

### 2.4 Southern and other controls: sign mismatches suggest different data/year/weights
- Southern:
  - **True Model 1:** +0.024
  - **Generated Model 1:** -0.051
- Occupational prestige:
  - **True Model 1:** -0.020
  - **Generated Model 1:** +0.060
These are not small rounding issues; they look like a different estimation setup.

**How to fix**
- Confirm:
  - correct year (1993 GSS as in Bryson)
  - correct weighting (if Bryson used weights, you must use same)
  - correct variable versions (e.g., PRESTG80 is fine only if it matches what the paper used)

## 4) Analytic sample / N mismatches (root cause of many coefficient differences)

This is the biggest structural discrepancy.

- **True:** N=644 and N=605.
- **Generated:** N=261 and N=259.

With different N, you are not estimating the same model on the same sample, so coefficients and significance will not align.

**How to fix**
1. Replicate Bryson’s **inclusion criteria** exactly:
   - same year(s) of data
   - same handling of missing values (listwise deletion rules)
   - same construction of the DV indices (which items, which “dislike” coding, treatment of “don’t know,” etc.)
2. Confirm you didn’t accidentally restrict to a subgroup (e.g., only respondents with nonmissing prestige, income per capita, denom variables, etc.). Any one variable with high missingness can collapse N dramatically.
3. If you created `income_pc = REALINC/HOMPOP`, note: HOMPOP missingness (or zeros) can delete many cases. Bryson may have used a different household size variable, different income measure, or different missing-data treatment.

---

## 5) Interpretation/reporting mismatches

### 5.1 Standard errors
- **True table:** no SEs.
- **Generated request:** “mismatch in standard errors”
- **Generated output shown:** does not actually report SEs either—so there’s nothing to compare. If you *did* generate SEs elsewhere, they wouldn’t be directly checkable against Table 2.

**Fix**
- Do not claim you are reproducing SEs from Bryson Table 2. Only reproduce standardized betas + stars.

### 5.2 Significance stars are inconsistent
Even where betas are close (e.g., racism and age in Model 1), stars differ because:
- different N,
- possibly different p-value calculation (robust vs classical),
- possibly different two-tailed vs one-tailed (Bryson states two-tailed),
- possibly unweighted vs weighted.

**Fix**
- Use the same N and same model assumptions; then compute stars using **two-tailed** p-values and the same SE type as the original (almost certainly conventional OLS, unless Bryson specifies otherwise).

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Lock the sample sizes to N=644 and N=605**
   - Rebuild the DV construction first, then apply only the exclusions necessary to match Bryson’s N.
   - Identify which variable(s) are causing the huge N drop (often denom, prestige, or income-per-capita denominator).

2. **Recode “No religion” correctly and ensure variation**
   - Verify RELIG coding; don’t assume `RELIG==4`.
   - After all filters: confirm both 0 and 1 exist in `no_religion`.

3. **Rebuild “Conservative Protestant” using the paper’s scheme**
   - Replace the proxy (`RELIG==1 & DENOM==1`) with the correct denomination grouping.

4. **Ensure race/ethnicity categories match Bryson**
   - Make categories mutually exclusive with the same reference group.
   - Ensure Hispanic is coded the same way (and not simultaneously counted in other race dummies).

5. **Match the estimation approach**
   - Standardized coefficients: either standardize X and Y before OLS or compute beta from unstandardized b using SD ratios—just do it consistently.
   - Use the same weighting (if any) and same treatment of missing data.

If you share the code (or at least the exact variable coding rules and filters) used to produce the generated models, I can point to the exact line(s) that are producing (a) the N collapse and (b) the “no religion has no variation” error, which are the two most decisive blockers to matching Table 2.
