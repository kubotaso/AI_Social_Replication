Score: 10/100
============================================================

## 1) Table/variable-name mismatches

### A. DV / model labeling mismatch
- **Generated**: `ModelA_*` uses `dislike_minority6` with **N=203**; `ModelB_*` uses `dislike_other12` with **N=197**.
- **True (Bryson Table 2)**: Model 1 and Model 2 use **N=644** and **N=605**, respectively, from **GSS 1993**.

**Fix**
- Recreate the analytic sample to match Bryson (1996): GSS 1993, correct age restrictions (if any), nonmissing on the DV and all covariates as done in the paper, and correct construction of both DVs (6 genres vs remaining 12).
- Your N being ~200 indicates you’re either using a different dataset/year, a restricted subsample, or listwise deletion after variable construction that doesn’t match the paper.

---

### B. Predictor naming: mostly cosmetic but must align
Generated names differ from the paper’s table labels (not fatal, but you were asked to match exactly):
- `racism_score` vs **Racism score**
- `education_years` vs **Education**
- `hh_income_per_capita` vs **Household income per capita**
- `occ_prestige` vs **Occupational prestige**
- `female` vs **Female**
- `age_years` vs **Age**
- `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` vs **Black/Hispanic/Other race**
- `cons_protestant` vs **Conservative Protestant**
- `no_religion` vs **No religion**
- `south` vs **Southern**

**Fix**
- Rename variables in the output table to match the paper’s labels. This is presentation-level, but required for “matches.”

## 2) Coefficient/significance mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I compare your **paper_style** standardized coefficients (`coef_table2`) to Bryson Table 2 coefficients.

### Model 1 (true “Dislike of Rap…Latin”, N=644)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.138 | 0.130** | **Stars wrong** (you show none) and value slightly off |
| Education | -0.253 | -0.175*** | **Magnitude + stars wrong** |
| HH income pc | 0.024 | -0.037 | **Sign wrong** |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.020 | **Sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.037 | -0.057 | Different magnitude (ok-ish) |
| Age | 0.150* | 0.163*** | **Stars wrong** |
| Black | -0.192 | -0.132*** | **Stars missing; magnitude off** |
| Hispanic | 0.063 | -0.058 | **Sign wrong** |
| Other race | -0.009 | -0.017 | Close (sign matches) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.073 | 0.063 | Close |
| No religion | dropped (zero variance) | 0.057 | **Should not be dropped** |
| Southern | -0.023 | 0.024 | **Sign wrong** |
| Constant | 2.823*** | 2.415*** | Different |

### Model 2 (true “Dislike of 12 remaining”, N=605)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.013 | 0.080 | **Sign wrong** |
| Education | -0.260** | -0.242*** | **Stars wrong** (should be ***) |
| HH income pc | -0.068 | -0.065 | Close |
| Occ prestige | -0.098 | 0.005 | **Sign + magnitude wrong** |
| Female | -0.093 | -0.070 | Different |
| Age | -0.006 | 0.126** | **Sign + magnitude wrong** |
| Black | 0.012 | 0.042 | Different |
| Hispanic | 0.071 | -0.029 | **Sign wrong** |
| Other race | 0.154* | 0.047 | **Magnitude + stars wrong** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.114 | 0.048 | Different |
| No religion | dropped | 0.024 | **Should not be dropped** |
| Southern | 0.186** | 0.069 | **Magnitude + stars wrong** |
| Constant | 7.077*** | 7.860 (no stars shown) | Different (also star handling differs) |

**Core conclusion:** these are not “small rounding” differences. Many coefficients flip sign and several change substantially—strong evidence you are **not reproducing Bryson’s Table 2** (different sample, different coding, and/or different DV construction).

---

## 3) Standard error mismatches (and why they cannot “match” Table 2)

- **Generated**: you report `std_err`, `t`, `p_value` in `ModelA_full` / `ModelB_full`.
- **True**: Bryson Table 2 **does not report SEs at all**. So there is nothing to compare against; any SE comparison is necessarily a mismatch to the *reported* table.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match the *paper’s Table 2*, remove SEs from the “paper_style” table and present only standardized coefficients with stars.
- If the goal is replication beyond Table 2, you can compute SEs—but then you must state clearly they are **from your re-estimation**, not extracted from the published table.

---

## 4) “No religion” incorrectly dropped as zero variance

- **Generated**: `no_religion` is flagged `zero_variance` and dropped in both models.
- **True**: “No religion” is included with nonzero coefficients (0.057; 0.024).

**Fix**
- Diagnose coding:
  - You likely created `no_religion` as a constant (all 0s or all 1s) due to a bad recode or filtering step.
  - Or you subsetted to a group where it truly has no variance (which would again indicate the wrong sample).
- Check frequency table of `no_religion` in the analytic sample; fix recode and/or sample definition until it varies and matches GSS 1993 distributions.

---

## 5) Fit statistics mismatch (R² / adj R²)

- **Generated**:
  - ModelA: R² = .165, adj R² = .117, N=203
  - ModelB: R² = .194, adj R² = .146, N=197
- **True**:
  - Model 1: R² = .145, adj R² = .129, N=644
  - Model 2: R² = .147, adj R² = .130, N=605

**Fix**
- These will only align after:
  1) matching the sample and weights (if used),
  2) matching DV construction,
  3) matching covariate coding and reference categories,
  4) matching whether Bryson uses listwise deletion and exactly which missing codes are treated as missing.

---

## 6) Interpretation mismatches implied by sign reversals

Because many generated coefficients have the opposite sign from the true table (e.g., income, southern, Hispanic in Model 1; racism and age in Model 2), any narrative interpretation based on the generated output will contradict Bryson’s findings.

**Fix**
- Do **not** “edit the interpretation” to fit. You must fix the estimation inputs so the coefficients themselves align:
  - Confirm you’re using the same dependent variables (counts of disliked genres) and the same genre groupings.
  - Confirm the direction of the DV: “number of genres disliked” (higher = more dislikes). A reversed DV (likes instead of dislikes, or 0/1 swapped) would flip signs.
  - Confirm the racism scale direction (higher = more racist). A reverse-coded racism scale would flip its coefficient sign.
  - Confirm race/region dummies match the paper’s reference category.

---

## 7) Constants don’t match (and why)
- **Generated constants**: 2.823 and 7.077 (both starred).
- **True constants**: 2.415*** and 7.860 (no significance shown in your transcription for Model 2 constant; in many tables constants are shown without stars even if significant).

**Fix**
- Once the sample and DV coding match, constants will move closer.
- Also match the paper’s reporting convention: if Table 2 doesn’t star the Model 2 constant, don’t star it in the “paper_style” output.

---

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches Table 2

1) **Use the correct data**: GSS 1993, not a restricted N≈200 subset unless the paper did so (it didn’t, per Table 2 N’s).
2) **Rebuild the two DVs exactly**:
   - Model 1 DV = number of disliked genres among (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin).
   - Model 2 DV = number of disliked genres among the other 12.
   - Ensure “disliked” is coded consistently and summed as counts.
3) **Recode predictors to match Bryson**:
   - Racism score scale direction.
   - Education measure (years vs categories) consistent with the paper.
   - Income per capita construction and scaling.
   - Occupational prestige measure consistent with GSS variable Bryson used.
   - Region dummy for “Southern”.
   - Religion dummies, ensuring “No religion” varies and is not accidentally constant.
4) **Estimate standardized OLS coefficients** (beta weights) and report only those + stars in the Table 2-style output.
5) **Stars must correspond to Bryson’s thresholds** (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001) and will only match once the sample/model matches.

If you share your codebook/coding rules (especially DV construction, racism scale, and sample restrictions), I can pinpoint the specific step causing the biggest sign flips (DV reversal vs scale reversal vs wrong genre grouping).
