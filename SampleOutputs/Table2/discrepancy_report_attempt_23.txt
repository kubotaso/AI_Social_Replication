============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / inclusion mismatches

**1.1 “ModelA” and “ModelB” are not Model 1 / Model 2 from Bryson (1996).**  
- **Generated:** `modelA_fit N=261`, `modelB_fit N=259`.  
- **True:** Model 1 `N=644`, Model 2 `N=605`.  
**Fix:** Recreate the analytic sample to match Bryson’s Table 2 (same survey wave, same inclusion rules, and same missing-data handling). Your workflow is doing *listwise deletion across many covariates with heavy missingness*, collapsing N to ~260.

**1.2 “No religion” is incorrectly dropped / set to NaN.**  
- **Generated:** `No religion = NaN` and `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion` for both models.  
- **True:** No religion is included with nonzero coefficients (Model 1: `0.057`, Model 2: `0.024`).  
**Fix:** Don’t drop `no_religion` as “no variation.” In your analytic frames, `no_religion` clearly takes values (0/1), so the “no variation” detection is buggy. Specifically:
- Verify the drop rule: it should test `n_unique(x[!is.na(x)]) == 1`.  
- Ensure you’re not computing uniqueness *after filtering to a subgroup* where it becomes constant by accident (e.g., after restricting to only conservative Protestants, etc.).  
- Confirm the variable isn’t being overwritten (all 0) during recoding.

**1.3 Race/ethnicity coding likely mismatched to Bryson’s specification.**  
- **Generated:** includes `Black`, `Hispanic`, `Other race` all as separate dummies—but the sample shows many rows with `black=1` and `hispanic=1` simultaneously, which is usually impossible if categories are mutually exclusive.  
- **True:** Table 2 treats Black, Hispanic, Other race as mutually exclusive categories relative to an omitted reference (presumably White).  
**Fix:** Rebuild race/ethnicity variables to be mutually exclusive:
- Create one categorical race variable, then dummy-code with White as the reference.
- Ensure Hispanic is treated as either ethnicity overriding race (common in survey coding) or as in Bryson’s coding—Table 2 implies exclusive groups.

**1.4 “Southern” sign interpretation depends on reference and coding; your sign is inconsistent with the table.**  
- **Generated:** Southern is negative in Model A (`-0.059959`) and positive in Model B (`0.101306`).  
- **True:** Southern is positive in both (Model 1: `0.024`, Model 2: `0.069`).  
**Fix:** Check `southern` coding (1 = South). If it’s reversed (1 = non-South), coefficients flip sign. Also ensure you’re matching Bryson’s region definition (Census South vs. self-report).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (direction, magnitude, significance)

Below are *direct* mismatches between generated standardized betas and Bryson’s Table 2.

#### 2.1 Racism score
- **Model 1 (DV1 minority6):**  
  - **Generated:** `0.143*`  
  - **True:** `0.130**`  
  **Mismatch:** significance level (should be ** not *), coefficient slightly off.
- **Model 2 (DV2 remaining12):**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.0086` (negative ~0)  
  - **True:** `0.080` (positive)  
  **Mismatch:** **wrong sign and magnitude**.  
**Fix:** This is almost certainly driven by the wrong analytic sample (N=259 vs 605) and/or different covariate set/coding. Reproduce Bryson’s sample and coding; the racism effect should be weakly positive in Model 2.

#### 2.2 Education
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.260***`  
  - **True:** `-0.175***`  
  **Mismatch:** too large (more negative).
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.165*`  
  - **True:** `-0.242***`  
  **Mismatch:** too small and wrong significance (should be ***).  
**Fix:** Again points to sample/coding mismatch. Also confirm you are using the same education measure (years vs degree categories) and standardizing the same way.

#### 2.3 Household income per capita
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.013`  
  - **True:** `-0.037`  
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.079`  
  - **True:** `-0.065`  
**Fix:** Income scaling won’t change standardized betas, but sample differences and missing-data handling will. Also ensure you used *household income per capita* and not raw household income, and not logged unless Bryson did (Table 2 implies linear).

#### 2.4 Occupational prestige
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** `+0.057`  
  - **True:** `-0.020`  
  **Mismatch:** wrong sign.  
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.083`  
  - **True:** `+0.005`  
  **Mismatch:** wrong sign and much larger magnitude.  
**Fix:** Occupational prestige variable is likely not the same construct/scale (or mis-merged). Verify you are using the same prestige index Bryson used and that higher values mean higher prestige.

#### 2.5 Female
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.035`  
  - **True:** `-0.057`  
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.084`  
  - **True:** `-0.070`  
**Fix:** Minor numeric differences consistent with sample mismatch.

#### 2.6 Age
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** `0.174**`  
  - **True:** `0.163***`  
  **Mismatch:** significance (*** vs **).  
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** `0.125` (no sig)  
  - **True:** `0.126**`  
  **Mismatch:** missing significance stars.  
**Fix:** stars are being computed from your model’s p-values, but because the sample is wrong (and maybe SEs are wrong/robust vs not), p-values differ. Once the sample matches, stars should match.

#### 2.7 Black
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.2005` (no sig shown)  
  - **True:** `-0.132***`  
  **Mismatch:** magnitude and missing ***.
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** `+0.025`  
  - **True:** `+0.042`  
  **Mismatch:** small.
**Fix:** Race coding and sample are likely wrong. Also: if your Black dummy overlaps with Hispanic, coefficients will be distorted.

#### 2.8 Hispanic
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** `+0.030`  
  - **True:** `-0.058`  
  **Mismatch:** wrong sign.  
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** `+0.018`  
  - **True:** `-0.029`  
  **Mismatch:** wrong sign.  
**Fix:** This strongly suggests your Hispanic variable is not coded like Bryson’s (or the overlap problem: Hispanic respondents also flagged as Black, changing the meaning). Recode ethnicity/race to match the paper.

#### 2.9 Other race
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** `-0.005`  
  - **True:** `-0.017` (close-ish)
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** `+0.124*`  
  - **True:** `+0.047`  
  **Mismatch:** much larger and significance differs.  
**Fix:** Same race/ethnicity coding and sample issues; “Other” may be very small in your N=259 sample, inflating instability.

#### 2.10 Conservative Protestant
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** `0.118`  
  - **True:** `0.063`  
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** `0.141*`  
  - **True:** `0.048`  
  **Mismatch:** much larger.  
**Fix:** Conservative Protestant definition likely differs (denomination classification), and your listwise deletion is selecting a non-representative subset (those with nonmissing racism + religion, etc.).

### 3) Standard errors: required vs not applicable

**3.1 Generated output implies inferential testing but you have no SE table; “True results” explicitly have no SEs.**  
- **True:** Bryson’s Table 2 reports standardized betas and stars; no SEs shown.  
- **Generated:** you compute stars (implying you computed SEs/p-values), but you do not display SEs.  
**Mismatch (interpretation/reporting):** If you claim to be reproducing Table 2 “exactly,” you should not add SEs or alternative inference conventions.  
**Fix:** Report only standardized coefficients and Bryson-style stars. Internally you’ll still compute SEs for p-values, but don’t present them as if they are in the original table.

---

### 4) Model fit / constants / R² / adjusted R² / N mismatches

**4.1 Constants**
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated constant:** `2.600***`  
  - **True constant:** `2.415***`  
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated constant:** `5.198***`  
  - **True constant:** `7.860` (no stars shown in your transcription; also notably larger)  
**Fix:** Constants are highly sensitive to sample, DV scaling, and whether predictors are centered/standardized before estimating. Bryson reports standardized betas but an unstandardized intercept. To match:
- Estimate the model on *raw variables* (not z-scored) and then compute standardized betas separately, **or** use a standardized-coefficient routine that leaves intercept consistent with the unstandardized model.

**4.2 R² and Adjusted R²**
- **Model 1:**  
  - **Generated:** R² `0.178`, Adj `0.142`  
  - **True:** R² `0.145`, Adj `0.129`
- **Model 2:**  
  - **Generated:** R² `0.151`, Adj `0.113`  
  - **True:** R² `0.147`, Adj `0.130`  
**Fix:** Primary issue is N/sample mismatch; also verify you are fitting OLS with the same covariates and no extra transformations/weights. Bryson likely used survey weights? (Not shown in your excerpt—needs checking.) If weights were used, unweighted R² can differ.

**4.3 N**
- **Generated:** 261 and 259  
- **True:** 644 and 605  
**Fix:** Your missingness table shows `racism_score` missing ~47.6% and `cons_prot` missing ~36.3%, which—combined with listwise deletion—crushes N. To match Bryson you must replicate his missing-data strategy (possibilities):
- He used a different wave or constructed racism score from fewer items with less missingness.
- He used imputation or coded missing to retain cases.
- He did not require `cons_prot` / `no_religion` for everyone (e.g., different religion variable availability).
You need to consult the paper’s methods appendix/data section and implement the same approach.

### 5) Interpretation mismatches embedded in the generated pipeline

**5.1 Your workflow implicitly interprets results as coming from “YEAR==1993” with very small N, but Table 2’s N is much larger.**  
**Fix:** Confirm you’re using the correct dataset/year and that your DV construction matches Bryson’s. If Bryson pooled years or used a different year than 1993, your restriction is wrong.

**5.2 Your DVs’ descriptives don’t align with the model sample.**  
- **Generated:** DV descriptives show N=1134 (DV1) and 1057 (DV2), but models are fit on N≈260 due to covariate missingness.  
**Fix:** When presenting “Table 2 replication,” report descriptives for the *analytic sample used in the regression* (or explicitly label them as full-year DV availability). Bryson’s reported N corresponds to the regression sample.

## Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996)

1. **Match the sample definition** used for Table 2 (year(s), age restrictions if any, handling of missing items for racism and religion). Do not assume `YEAR==1993` is correct without verifying.
2. **Fix race/ethnicity coding** so Black/Hispanic/Other are mutually exclusive and match Bryson’s categories and reference group.
3. **Fix the “no_religion dropped” bug** (incorrect “no variation” detection or recode).
4. **Use the same religion classification** for “Conservative Protestant” as the paper.
5. **Estimate unstandardized OLS**, then compute **standardized betas** from that model (to keep the intercept comparable).
6. **Apply the same weighting and inference approach** (two-tailed tests; same p-value thresholds). If Bryson used weights/complex survey adjustments, replicate them; otherwise don’t use robust/HC SEs if he used classical OLS SEs.
7. **Recreate Table 2 formatting**: coefficients + stars only; no SEs.

If you share (a) your exact code for constructing `racism_score`, `cons_prot`, `no_religion`, and race dummies, and (b) whether you used weights/robust SEs, I can point to the precise line(s) causing each discrepancy.
