============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / variable-order mismatches (and implied interpretation errors)

Because your **Generated Results** tables show **no variable names**, the only way to compare is by *row position*. That’s already a discrepancy: the paper’s Table 2 is explicitly labeled by variable. You need to print/export coefficients **with variable names** in the same order as Table 2.

Assuming your rows correspond to the Table 2 order:

1. Racism score  
2. Education  
3. Household income per capita  
4. Occupational prestige  
5. Female  
6. Age  
7. Black  
8. Hispanic  
9. Other race  
10. Conservative Protestant  
11. No religion  
12. Southern  

your generated tables have **12 rows of betas**, but your `k_predictors = 11` and your fit table says `dropped_predictors_post_listwise = no_religion`. That implies:

- You *intended* 12 predictors (matches paper),  
- but after listwise deletion, **“no_religion” was removed**, leaving **11** predictors,
- yet your printed beta table still has **12 lines**, including a **NaN row** (likely where `no_religion` should be).

**Fix**
- Ensure the model matrix and the printed coefficient table come from the **same fitted model object** after listwise deletion.  
- If `no_religion` is dropped due to no variance / collinearity / all-missing, you must either:
  - (a) fix the data so `no_religion` is defined and varies (correct coding, missing handling), or
  - (b) accept it’s not estimable and **remove it from the comparison** (and from the coefficient display), and explicitly note the deviation from the paper.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (Model 1 / “ModelA_std_beta”)

Below I map your **Generated ModelA** rows (assuming Table 2 order) to the **True** coefficients.

| Variable | True β (Model 1) | Generated β_std (ModelA) | Mismatch? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.136751 | Close in value, but **stars wrong** (see §4) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.253065 | **Too negative** and stars differ |
| Income pc | -0.037 | 0.023619 | **Wrong sign** |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.004990 | **Wrong sign** (small) |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.035982 | Different magnitude (same sign) |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.149881 | Close magnitude; **stars wrong** (paper has ***) |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.179897 | More negative; **stars wrong** (paper has ***) |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | 0.045223 | **Wrong sign** |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.009744 | Close-ish (same sign) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.074344 | Close-ish |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN | **Not estimated** (dropped) |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.023261 | **Wrong sign** |

**Fix**
- You are not reproducing the same dataset/specification as Bryson (1993 GSS; N=644). Your N is **203**, which virtually guarantees different estimates and significance. To match the paper:
  - Use **GSS 1993**, and the exact **genre dislike index construction** used by Bryson.
  - Recreate the **same sample restrictions** and missing-data handling (the paper’s N is much larger).
  - Recreate **exact variable codings** (especially race categories, religion categories, and “Southern”), because sign flips on *income, Hispanic, Southern* strongly suggest coding or reference-group problems.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (Model 2 / “ModelB_std_beta”)

Same row-order assumption:

| Variable | True β (Model 2) | Generated β_std (ModelB) | Mismatch? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.013324 | **Wrong sign** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.260103 | Close; stars differ slightly (should be ***) |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.067531 | Close |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.097652 | **Wrong sign & magnitude** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.092778 | Somewhat close |
| Age | 0.126** | -0.006043 | **Wrong sign** |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.012165 | Same sign, smaller |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | 0.070839 | **Wrong sign** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.154067 | Same sign, much larger |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.114144 | Same sign, larger |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN | **Not estimated** |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.185956 | Same sign, much larger |

**Fix**
- Again, your **sample (N=197)** is nowhere near the paper’s **N=605**.  
- The sign flips for **racism, age, Hispanic, occ prestige** suggest either:
  - you’re not using the same DV (dislike of the *12 remaining* genres), or
  - you constructed the DV differently (e.g., reversed coding; different list of genres; different scaling), or
  - covariates are miscoded (e.g., age centered/scaled incorrectly wouldn’t flip sign usually, but DV reversal would).

Concrete steps:
1. Verify DV coding direction: “number of genres disliked” must increase with *more* dislikes. If you accidentally coded “liked,” many signs would invert.
2. Verify genre sets: Model 1 uses the *minority-linked six genres*; Model 2 uses the *other twelve*. Any misclassification changes results.
3. Verify race dummy reference: Table includes **Black, Hispanic, Other race** with implied reference = **White**. If your reference group differs or you included White as a dummy too, coefficients can shift.
4. Verify occupational prestige measure: wrong variable (e.g., respondent prestige vs spouse, or different scale) can produce big discrepancies (your ModelB occ prestige is -0.098 vs true 0.005).

### 4) Significance stars, p-values, and “standard errors” mismatches

#### (a) Table 2 does **not** report SEs (and your output does not show SEs either)
Your instruction says “mismatch in … standard errors,” but:
- The **True Results** explicitly: *no standard errors in the PDF table*.
- Your Generated tables also do **not** provide SEs; they provide `p_value_reest`.

So any attempt to “match SEs” is impossible from Table 2 alone.

**Fix**
- Remove claims about “matching standard errors to Table 2.”  
- If you want SEs, you must compute them from the microdata yourself (which is fine), but you cannot “verify” them against Table 2.

#### (b) Your p-values/stars do not match the paper’s star rules
Example ModelA:
- Racism in the paper is **0.130** with ** (p<.01). Your p=0.0718 → no star.**
- Age in the paper is ***; your p=0.0464 → only *.
- Black in the paper is ***; your p=0.174 → none.

So either:
- you’re using a different sample/spec, or
- you’re using different inference (robust SEs, weights, design effects), but even then with N that small you won’t match.

**Fix**
- First fix the **data/specification** to match N and coding.  
- Then apply the paper’s thresholds (* <.05, ** <.01, *** <.001, two-tailed) to your computed p-values.

### 5) Model fit mismatches (N, R², adjusted R², constant)

#### Model 1 fit:
- True: **N=644; R²=.145; adj R²=.129; Constant=2.415***  
- Generated: **N=203; R²=0.1647; adj R²=0.1166; Constant=2.8289***

#### Model 2 fit:
- True: **N=605; R²=.147; adj R²=.130; Constant=7.860 (no stars shown in paper)**  
- Generated: **N=197; R²=0.1942; adj R²=0.1463; Constant=7.0768***  

These are not close, especially **N** and constants.

**Fix**
- Match Bryson’s sample and variable construction exactly (the N mismatch is the clearest sign you are not reproducing the same analysis).
- Also note: the paper reports **standardized coefficients** but still reports an **unstandardized constant** (common in such tables). Your constant won’t match unless DV scaling matches exactly.

### 6) The biggest structural discrepancies causing everything else

1. **Wrong dataset / year / filtering / missing-data handling**  
   Your N (~200) suggests you’re using a much smaller subset than GSS 1993 respondents with music-module data.

2. **DV construction likely differs**  
   Sign flips across multiple predictors (especially Model 2 racism and age) are consistent with DV reversal or genre-set mismatch.

3. **Religion dummy problem (“no_religion” dropped)**  
   Paper includes both **Conservative Protestant** and **No religion** as predictors; you failed to estimate `no_religion`.

4. **Output formatting prevents auditing**
   No variable names shown → impossible to guarantee row alignment.

---

### 7) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Rebuild variables exactly as in Bryson (1996)**
   - DV1: count of dislikes among the six minority-linked genres.
   - DV2: count of dislikes among the remaining twelve.
   - Ensure “dislike” is coded the same way (and that higher = more dislikes).

2. **Use the same sample**
   - GSS **1993**, same inclusion criteria.
   - Apply listwise deletion across *all* predictors used in that model to match N.
   - Your target Ns: **644** and **605**.

3. **Recreate covariates and reference categories**
   - Race dummies with **White omitted**.
   - Gender coding so “Female” matches paper sign expectations.
   - Religion categories so both **Conservative Protestant** and **No religion** are estimable (not all-missing, not perfectly collinear).

4. **Estimate standardized coefficients the same way**
   - Table reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas). Confirm you are computing betas comparable to Stata/SPSS style: standardize X and Y (or equivalent transformation) for slopes.

5. **Report results in the paper’s format**
   - Show variable names.
   - Show standardized betas and significance markers only (unless you clearly label additional statistics as your own).

If you paste the exact variable-to-row mapping from your code (or the regression output with names), I can point to *which specific generated row corresponds to which predictor* with certainty and flag any additional mismatches beyond what can be inferred from row order.
