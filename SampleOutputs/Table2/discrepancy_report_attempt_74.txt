Score: 30/100
============================================================

Below are **all mismatches** between your *Generated Results* and the *True Results* (Bryson 1996 Table 2), grouped by: **variable names/presence**, **coefficients & significance**, **constants/fit stats/sample sizes**, and **interpretation/reporting problems**. For each, I explain **how to fix** the generated analysis so it matches the paper.

---

## 1) Variable list / naming / missingness mismatches

### 1.1 “Hispanic” is missing in the generated regression output (NaN) but present in the true table
- **Generated:** `Hispanic = NaN` in both Model 1 and Model 2; `Dropped_all_missing: hispanic`
- **True:** Hispanic is included with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **-0.058** (not starred)
  - Model 2: **-0.029** (not starred)

**Fix**
- Ensure the Hispanic dummy is actually constructed and non-missing in the analytic dataset used for regression.
  - If source variable has codes like {1=Hispanic, 0=not}, don’t overwrite with NA by mistaken recode.
  - If you created `black`, `other_race` but forgot `hispanic`, create it consistently:
    - `hispanic = 1[race_ethnicity == "Hispanic"] else 0`
  - Confirm Hispanic is **not perfectly collinear** with other race dummies (see below).

### 1.2 “Other race” sign differs and suggests different coding/reference group than the paper
- **Generated (Model 1):** Other race **+0.010867**
- **True (Model 1):** Other race **-0.017**
- **Generated (Model 2):** Other race **+0.076128**
- **True (Model 2):** Other race **+0.047**

This could be just estimation/sample differences, but given other big mismatches, it strongly suggests **race dummies are not coded the same way** (or you changed the sample).

**Fix**
- Replicate the paper’s race specification: likely **White as the omitted category**, and include dummies for **Black, Hispanic, Other** simultaneously.
- Verify you did not:
  - use “nonwhite” as reference,
  - collapse categories differently,
  - or drop Hispanics and then re-normalize race.

### 1.3 Age variable naming inconsistency
- **Generated:** `age_years` in sample, shown as “Age” in table.
- **True:** “Age”.

This one is cosmetic (not a statistical mismatch), but it’s a **reproducibility discrepancy**.

**Fix**
- Either rename to exactly match the paper in all outputs, or document mapping (`age_years` → `Age`).

---

## 2) Coefficients & significance: every mismatch

The paper reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. Your generated tables also say “Standardized beta”, so they *should* be directly comparable.

### Model 1 coefficient mismatches

| Variable | Generated beta (Sig) | True beta (Sig) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.131833 (**) | 0.130 (**) | close (rounding OK) |
| Education | -0.180139 (***) | -0.175 (***) | slightly off |
| Household income per capita | +0.008961 (none) | **-0.037** (none) | **wrong sign + magnitude** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.019019 | -0.020 | close |
| Female | -0.071658 | -0.057 | off |
| Age | 0.156851 (***) | 0.163 (***) | slightly off |
| Black | -0.141030 (**) | **-0.132 (***)** | **sig level wrong** and coeff off |
| Hispanic | NaN | -0.058 | **missing entirely** |
| Other race | +0.010867 | **-0.017** | **wrong sign** |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.083766 | 0.063 | off |
| No religion | +0.068263 | 0.057 | off |
| Southern | +0.026711 | 0.024 | close |
| Constant | NaN (***) | **2.415 (***)** | **missing numeric constant** |

**Fixes (Model 1)**
1. **Restore Hispanic** (see §1.1).
2. Fix constant reporting (see §3.1).
3. Correct sample/specification (see §3.2–3.4) because the **income sign flip** and **race sign flip** are not rounding issues.
4. Correct significance testing/thresholds (see §4.2) because Black’s stars differ.

### Model 2 coefficient mismatches

| Variable | Generated beta (Sig) | True beta (Sig) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **-0.002233** | **0.080** | **wrong sign and magnitude** |
| Education | -0.194316 (***) | **-0.242 (***)** | **too small** |
| Household income per capita | -0.035654 | **-0.065** | off |
| Occupational prestige | -0.012431 | **0.005** | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.069205 | -0.070 | close |
| Age | 0.119317 (**) | 0.126 (**) | close-ish |
| Black | 0.066914 | 0.042 | off |
| Hispanic | NaN | -0.029 | **missing** |
| Other race | 0.076128 | 0.047 | off |
| Conservative Protestant | **0.101269 (*)** | **0.048 (none)** | **magnitude + significance wrong** |
| No religion | 0.018895 | 0.024 | close-ish |
| Southern | 0.075385 | 0.069 | close-ish |
| Constant | NaN (***) | **7.860 (none shown)** | **missing + wrong sig** |

**Fixes (Model 2)**
- The racism coefficient being near zero and negative (instead of +0.080) is a major red flag for **specification/sample mismatch** (or wrong DV). See §3.3 (DV construction) and §3.2 (sample size/weights).
- Restore Hispanic and correct constant reporting.

## 3) Constants, fit statistics, and N: major mismatches

### 3.1 Constant is missing (NaN) in generated output, but paper reports it
- **Generated:** Constant = NaN for both models; yet stars shown as `***`
- **True:** Constant is numeric:
  - Model 1: **2.415***  
  - Model 2: **7.860** (no stars printed in the table)

**Fix**
- You are mixing two incompatible things:
  - claiming coefficients are standardized betas **and**
  - trying to show an intercept.
- In a regression on standardized variables, the intercept should be ~0. In the paper, the intercept is clearly **unstandardized**, while slopes are standardized.

To match the paper:
- Compute/print **standardized slopes** (betas) but print the **unstandardized intercept** from the unstandardized model.
  - Common workflow:
    1) fit OLS on raw variables → intercept, SEs, p-values  
    2) compute standardized betas separately (or fit on standardized X and raw Y with appropriate conversion), but don’t lose intercept
- Or fit unstandardized model and convert slopes to standardized betas via:
  \[
  \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{\sigma_{x_j}}{\sigma_y}
  \]
  while keeping intercept as \(b_0\).

### 3.2 Sample size N is wrong in both models
- **Generated N:** Model 1 = **549**, Model 2 = **507**
- **True N:** Model 1 = **644**, Model 2 = **605**

These differences are too large to be rounding; they indicate **different missing-data handling and/or different variable construction**.

**Fix**
- Replicate Bryson’s case inclusion rules:
  - Use the same dataset/year and same exclusions.
  - Ensure you are not dropping many cases due to:
    - incorrectly-created missing values (especially Hispanic)
    - listwise deletion caused by income, prestige, religion, etc.
- After fixing Hispanic creation, re-check N; it should jump upward if that variable was all-missing.
- Confirm you’re not inadvertently restricting to only those with complete DV components (e.g., requiring all genre items present instead of allowing the index with partial data as the author did).

### 3.3 R² and adjusted R² do not match
- **Generated:**  
  - Model 1 R² = **0.133**, Adj R² = **0.115**
  - Model 2 R² = **0.120**, Adj R² = **0.100**
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**
  - Model 2 R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**

**Fix**
- Once the correct sample and DV are replicated, R² should be close.
- If still off, check:
  - survey weights (Table 2 may be weighted; many GSS-based papers are)
  - whether Bryson used any transformations (income per capita construction; prestige scale source)
  - whether the DV is scaled exactly as in the paper (see next).

### 3.4 “Constant_unstd” values in generated fit_stats don’t match true constants
- **Generated:** Model 1 constant_unstd **2.461148** (true 2.415), Model 2 constant_unstd **4.957739** (true 7.860)
- The Model 2 intercept is wildly different.

**Fix**
- This points again to **wrong DV scale/construction** for Model 2 (and possibly Model 1). See §3.3.

---

## 4) Interpretation/reporting problems (even if coefficients matched)

### 4.1 You report no standard errors, but your prompt asks to check SEs
- **True table:** explicitly does **not** report SEs.
- **Generated output:** also lacks SEs, but your task request includes “standard errors”.

**Fix**
- To match the paper: **do not invent or report SEs**.  
- If you want SEs for your own replication, report them separately and label them “not in Bryson (1996) Table 2”.

### 4.2 Significance stars mismatch (and likely p-value computation mismatch)
Examples:
- Model 1 Black:
  - **Generated:** ** (p<.01)
  - **True:** *** (p<.001)
- Model 2 Conservative Protestant:
  - **Generated:** * (p<.05)
  - **True:** no star

**Fix**
- Once the correct N/specification/weights are used, p-values will change.
- Also verify star thresholds match the paper (**two-tailed**):  
  \* < .05, ** < .01, *** < .001  
- Make sure you aren’t using robust SEs or different df corrections if the author used conventional OLS.

## 5) The biggest “root cause” issues to address (so everything aligns)

Given the pattern (N too low, Hispanic missing, racism in Model 2 totally different, intercepts off), the generated analysis is not the same as Bryson’s. To make it match, do this in order:

1) **Fix Hispanic dummy creation** so it’s non-missing and included with White as reference.  
2) **Rebuild both DVs exactly like Bryson**:
   - Model 1 DV: dislike of the 6 “minority-linked” genres (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin).
   - Model 2 DV: dislike of the *other 12 genres*.
   Ensure the same response coding and summation/averaging rules as the paper (critical for the intercept and racism effect).
3) **Match sample inclusion (N=644 and N=605)**:
   - avoid accidental listwise deletion
   - replicate any weighting/exclusions
4) **Compute standardized coefficients the same way as the paper**, but keep the **unstandardized constant** for reporting.
5) Recompute significance based on the matched model.

If you paste (a) your DV construction code/formula, (b) how you coded race/religion, and (c) whether you used weights, I can pinpoint which exact step is producing the big divergences (especially the Model 2 DV/intercept and the racism coefficient).
