Score: 23/100
============================================================

## 1) Global / structural discrepancies

### A. Wrong sample sizes (N) and likely wrong analytic sample construction
- **Generated**: Model A **N=261**, Model B **N=259**  
- **True (paper)**: Model 1 **N=644**, Model 2 **N=605**
- **Why this is a mismatch**: Your generated models are using far fewer cases than the published table—so they cannot reproduce the published coefficients/significance even if the specification is identical.
- **How to fix**
  1. Recreate Bryson’s **1993 GSS-only** analytic file and apply the **same inclusion criteria** (e.g., respondents asked the music module; valid outcome items; valid covariates).
  2. Ensure you are not accidentally:
     - restricting to a subsample (e.g., only one race group),
     - dropping many cases via listwise deletion due to a variable with high missingness (see “racism_score” and religion below),
     - or using a different wave/combined years dataset.
  3. In code: build the DV first, then check N after DV construction; then add predictors one block at a time and track where N collapses.

### B. “Standard errors” are invented / not comparable
- **True**: Table 2 **does not report SEs** (only standardized betas + stars).  
- **Generated request** includes “standard errors” mismatches, but your **Generated Results show no SE column at all**—so there’s nothing to compare. If elsewhere your pipeline produced SEs, they cannot be “validated” against Table 2.
- **How to fix**
  - Remove any claims that SEs match the paper.
  - If you want SEs, you must re-estimate the model from microdata; then you can report SEs, but they will be *new outputs*, not something “from Table 2”.

### C. Variable naming mismatch and DV naming mismatch (not just labels)
- **Generated DV names**: `dislike_minority_genres`, `dislike_other12_genres` (and in fit tables: `dislike_minority6`, `dislike_other12`)  
- **True DVs (paper wording)**:
  - Model 1: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”
  - Model 2: “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”
- **How to fix**
  - Ensure the DV is coded as **the count of disliked genres** among the exact sets Bryson uses.
  - Confirm you used the same “dislike” threshold/coding rule as Bryson (e.g., whether “dislike” vs “like neither” etc. are counted).

## 2) Term-by-term comparison: coefficients + stars (Model A vs True Model 1)

Below are **all mismatches** between Generated ModelA and True Model 1.

### Racism score
- **Generated**: **0.140983*** (1 star)  
- **True**: **0.130** (2 stars, **p<.01**)  
- **Mismatch**: coefficient slightly higher; **significance level differs** (* vs **).
- **Fix**: Use the correct analytic sample (N=644) and same racism scale construction/standardization; ensure same controls and coding.

### Education
- **Generated**: **-0.265987***  
- **True**: **-0.175***  
- **Mismatch**: magnitude much too strong in generated.
- **Fix**: sample/spec mismatch; also check whether education is coded in **years** vs categories or standardized differently.

### Household income per capita
- **Generated**: **-0.001868** (near zero)  
- **True**: **-0.037**  
- **Mismatch**: large discrepancy in magnitude.
- **Fix**: confirm the paper’s “household income per capita” transformation (income divided by household size, then standardized). Your descriptive mean (~14349) suggests you may be using raw dollars but not standardizing the same way before producing “beta_std”, or you’re standardizing *after* a different transformation than Bryson.

### Occupational prestige
- **Generated**: **0.051541**  
- **True**: **-0.020**  
- **Mismatch**: **sign flips** (positive vs negative).
- **Fix**: check prestige measure (e.g., NORC prestige score) and ensure higher = more prestige; verify no reverse coding or different variable substituted.

### Female
- **Generated**: **-0.029012**  
- **True**: **-0.057**  
- **Mismatch**: effect too small in magnitude.
- **Fix**: sample/coding differences; also confirm female coded 1=female, 0=male (your mean .573 suggests that’s plausible).

### Age
- **Generated**: **0.171529** (2 stars)  
- **True**: **0.163*** (3 stars)  
- **Mismatch**: coefficient close, but **significance differs** (** vs ***).
- **Fix**: again points to N/spec mismatch; with larger N the same beta is more significant.

### Black
- **Generated**: **-0.139887*** (1 star)  
- **True**: **-0.132*** (3 stars)  
- **Mismatch**: coefficient close; **stars very different**.
- **Fix**: same: restore correct N and weighting/SE assumptions. (Even without weights, N difference alone changes stars.)

### Hispanic
- **Generated**: **-0.010058**  
- **True**: **-0.058**  
- **Mismatch**: much smaller magnitude in generated.
- **Fix**: likely sample restriction or different Hispanic coding; note your `hispanic` has **358 missing** in diagnostics—this will radically change the listwise sample unless handled.

### Other race
- **Generated**: **-0.017174**  
- **True**: **-0.017**  
- **Mismatch**: essentially matches (rounding only).  
- **Fix**: none.

### Conservative Protestant
- **Generated**: **0.075955**  
- **True**: **0.063**  
- **Mismatch**: small.
- **Fix**: make sure religion categories match Bryson’s definition of “conservative Protestant.”

### No religion
- **Generated**: **NaN** (dropped) and Fit table says dropped `no_religion`  
- **True**: **0.057** (included)
- **Mismatch**: variable is missing/dropped in generated but estimated in paper.
- **Fix**:
  - Do not drop it. Diagnose why it becomes singular/NaN:
    - perfect collinearity with intercept + other religion dummies (e.g., if you included a full set of religion dummies plus constant),
    - or all remaining cases after listwise deletion have no variation.
  - Solution: use **one reference category** for religion and include dummies accordingly (or include `no_religion` alone as in the table, presumably with others captured elsewhere).

### Southern
- **Generated**: **-0.041032**  
- **True**: **0.024**  
- **Mismatch**: **sign flips**.
- **Fix**: check coding (1=South vs 1=non-South) and/or whether the paper uses “South” region definition. Verify you didn’t reverse it.

### Constant
- **Generated**: **2.600456***  
- **True**: **2.415***  
- **Mismatch**: different intercept (also not the main target if betas are standardized; but paper reports a constant anyway).
- **Fix**: intercept depends on DV coding and sample; align DV construction and sample.

### Model fit
- **Generated**: R² **0.1731**, Adj R² **0.13657**  
- **True**: R² **.145**, Adj R² **.129**
- **Mismatch**: both differ; Adj R² particularly off (your k and N are different).
- **Fix**: align N and predictors; ensure you have the same set of predictors (including `no_religion`) and same DV.

## 3) Term-by-term comparison: Model B vs True Model 2

### Racism score
- **Generated**: **-0.007558**  
- **True**: **0.080**  
- **Mismatch**: **sign flip** and big difference.
- **Fix**: this is a major indicator you are not reproducing the same DV construction and/or not using the same sample/year/module.

### Education
- **Generated**: **-0.177793*** (1 star)  
- **True**: **-0.242***  
- **Mismatch**: magnitude too small; stars differ (should be ***).
- **Fix**: sample/spec mismatch; confirm education coding.

### Household income per capita
- **Generated**: **-0.072609**  
- **True**: **-0.065**  
- **Mismatch**: close (rounding/estimation differences).
- **Fix**: minor; would likely converge once N/spec matches.

### Occupational prestige
- **Generated**: **-0.079832**  
- **True**: **0.005**  
- **Mismatch**: large and **sign flip**.
- **Fix**: wrong prestige variable, reverse coding, or sample differences.

### Female
- **Generated**: **-0.082484**  
- **True**: **-0.070**  
- **Mismatch**: small.

### Age
- **Generated**: **0.121588** (no stars)  
- **True**: **0.126** (**)  
- **Mismatch**: coefficient close; **significance missing**.
- **Fix**: N too small → less power.

### Black
- **Generated**: **0.086713**  
- **True**: **0.042**  
- **Mismatch**: too large.

### Hispanic
- **Generated**: **-0.023941**  
- **True**: **-0.029**  
- **Mismatch**: small.

### Other race
- **Generated**: **0.112130**  
- **True**: **0.047**  
- **Mismatch**: too large.

### Conservative Protestant
- **Generated**: **0.063597**  
- **True**: **0.048**  
- **Mismatch**: small.

### No religion
- **Generated**: **NaN** (dropped)  
- **True**: **0.024**  
- **Mismatch**: dropped vs included.
- **Fix**: same collinearity/definition fix as Model A.

### Southern
- **Generated**: **0.131971*** (1 star)  
- **True**: **0.069** (no star)  
- **Mismatch**: much larger and incorrectly significant.
- **Fix**: check coding and sample; also weighting/cluster design could affect stars if you computed them.

### Constant
- **Generated**: **5.271902***  
- **True**: **7.860** (no stars shown in paper table for constant)
- **Mismatch**: large difference implies DV construction differs (count range/meaning differs).

### Model fit
- **Generated**: R² **0.14073**, Adj R² **0.102463**  
- **True**: R² **.147**, Adj R² **.130**
- **Mismatch**: Adj R² far lower in generated because N is tiny and/or predictors differ.

## 4) Missingness diagnostics reveal why your models likely diverge

Key red flags:
- `racism_score`: **765 missing of 1606** (almost half missing)
- `conservative_protestant`: **583 missing of 1606**
- `hispanic`: **358 missing of 1606**
- DVs: `dislike_minority_genres` missing 472; `dislike_other12_genres` missing 549

If you run **listwise deletion** across DV + all covariates, N can easily collapse to ~250—matching your generated N. Bryson’s N (644/605) implies a **different missing-data situation**: either the items were only asked of a subsample (music module), or Bryson used a different treatment of missing (or you are using a dataset where these variables are missing for structural reasons and you’re not subsetting correctly first).

**How to fix**
1. Subset to respondents who were administered the **music dislike questions** first; then compute missingness *within that module-eligible subsample*.
2. Recode “inapplicable”/module-not-asked codes to missing **before** subsetting, otherwise you’ll delete the wrong people.
3. Recreate religion and race/ethnicity measures so they are not structurally missing for large blocks.

## 5) Interpretation mismatches (implied by signs/stars)

Even without your written narrative, the generated tables would lead to interpretations that contradict the paper:
- **Model 2 racism**: generated implies essentially **no/negative** association; true is **positive (0.080)**.
- **Southern in Model 1**: generated implies **South decreases dislike**; true implies a **small positive** effect.
- **Prestige**: generated changes direction and magnitude across models vs the paper.

**Fix**: Do not interpret until the model replicates:
- same year/module,
- same DV construction,
- same coding of region and prestige,
- same inclusion of `no_religion`,
- and roughly the same N.

## 6) Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Use GSS 1993** and the **music genres module** only.
2. **Construct DVs exactly** as counts of disliked genres in the two sets Bryson lists.
3. **Construct “racism score” exactly** as in Bryson (items, scaling, handling missing), then standardize.
4. Ensure predictors match Table 2:
   - education (years), income per capita (correct transformation), prestige (correct scale), female, age, black/hispanic/other (same reference), conservative Protestant, no religion, southern.
5. Fix dummy coding so **no_religion is not dropped** (avoid dummy-variable trap).
6. Use **standardized coefficients** (beta weights) computed the same way (typically by standardizing X and Y, or using a standardized regression routine).
7. Only then compare betas and stars; **do not claim SE comparisons** to Table 2.

If you share the exact code/data dictionary you used to build (a) racism_score, (b) the two DV counts, and (c) religion/region coding, I can pinpoint which construction step is causing the biggest sign flips (especially racism and prestige in Model 2, and southern in Model 1).
