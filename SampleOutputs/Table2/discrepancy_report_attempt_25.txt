Score: 19/100
============================================================

### 1) Outcome/model labeling mismatches

- **Model names don’t match the paper.**
  - **Generated:** “ModelA” and “ModelB”
  - **True:** “Model 1” and “Model 2”
  - **Fix:** Rename ModelA→Model 1 and ModelB→Model 2 (or explicitly map them in captions).

- **DV text mostly matches, but “count of 6/12” is an added construction.**
  - The paper’s DV names are as shown; your “count of 6/12” framing is fine *if that is how you built the DV*, but it should be made explicit that this reproduces Bryson’s index construction. Otherwise it reads like a different operationalization.
  - **Fix:** Add a footnote: “DV operationalized as Bryson’s dislike-count index (0–6 / 0–12).”

### 2) Sample size and fit statistics are wrong (major discrepancy)

#### Model 1 (Minority-liked 6 genres)
- **Generated N:** 340  
- **True N:** 644  → **Mismatch**
- **Generated R² / Adj R²:** 0.205 / 0.181  
- **True R² / Adj R²:** 0.145 / 0.129  → **Mismatch**
- **Generated Constant:** 2.656***  
- **True Constant:** 2.415***  → **Mismatch**

#### Model 2 (Remaining 12 genres)
- **Generated N:** 326  
- **True N:** 605  → **Mismatch**
- **Generated R² / Adj R²:** 0.167 / 0.141  
- **True R² / Adj R²:** 0.147 / 0.130  → **Mismatch**
- **Generated Constant:** 5.205***  
- **True Constant:** 7.860 (no sig stars shown in your transcription) → **Mismatch**

**Likely causes (from your own missingness table):**
- You are doing **listwise deletion** on variables that are missing in your extract (e.g., **Hispanic is 100% missing**; racism score ~48% missing; cons_prot ~36% missing). That collapses N far below the paper’s.
- You also appear to be using a dataset extract that simply does not contain key variables (Hispanic, possibly religion denomination), so your “replication” is actually a different model on a different subset.

**Fixes:**
1. **Use the same source file/year and variable set as Bryson (1996)** (GSS 1993 music module + the exact covariates).
2. **Do not run the model if a covariate is entirely missing** in your extract. Either:
   - obtain the missing variable(s), or
   - drop the variable and clearly state it’s not Table 2 anymore (but then do not claim it matches).
3. Apply **the same case-selection rules** as the paper (e.g., valid DV responses, valid covariates) to recover N≈644 and N≈605.
4. Re-check **weighting** (if Bryson used weights). If you ran unweighted OLS but the paper used weights, coefficients and R² will differ even with the same N.

### 3) Variable name / inclusion mismatches

- **Hispanic**
  - **Generated:** “Hispanic (NOT AVAILABLE IN EXTRACT)” with NaN; “Dropped_all_missing: hispanic”
  - **True:** Hispanic is included with nonzero coefficients in both models.
  - **Fix:** Merge/import the Hispanic indicator from the correct dataset extract/codebook. In GSS this is often `HISPANIC`/`HISPANIC1`/derived ethnicity—depends on extract. Until you have it, you cannot reproduce Table 2.

- **No religion**
  - **Generated:** marked “Dropped_no_variation: no_religion” and shown as NaN in coefficient tables.
  - **True:** No religion is included (0.057 in Model 1; 0.024 in Model 2).
  - **Fix:** Your analytic sample must contain variation in “no religion.” This “no variation” result usually comes from:
    - miscoding (e.g., mapping everyone to 0 or 1),
    - filtering that accidentally restricts to only one religious category,
    - constructing “no religion” from a variable that is missing/constant in your extract.
  - Rebuild from the original `RELIG` (or equivalent) with correct coding, and verify frequencies before modeling.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy if DENOM available)” (suggests a proxy measure)
  - **True:** “Conservative Protestant” (not described as proxy)
  - **Fix:** Use Bryson’s exact classification rule (likely based on denomination/fundamentalist grouping). If you cannot reproduce it, label it clearly as a proxy and do not expect coefficient matching.

- **Education**
  - **Generated:** “Education (years)”
  - **True:** “Education”
  - This is probably fine, but if Bryson used *years* vs *degree categories*, it changes results.
  - **Fix:** Confirm functional form and coding (years vs categories; top-coding).

- **Race categories**
  - You have Black and Other race, but Hispanic is missing; Bryson includes all three (Black, Hispanic, Other race).
  - **Fix:** include Hispanic and ensure race/ethnicity coding matches Bryson (mutually exclusive categories, reference group = White non-Hispanic).

### 4) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas + significance)

The paper reports **standardized OLS coefficients only** (no SEs). Your output is also standardized betas, but many values and stars differ.

#### Model 1: Minority-liked 6 genres (true vs generated)
- Racism: **0.130** vs **0.146** → mismatch (and stars match **)
- Education: **-0.175** vs **-0.266** → mismatch (both ***)
- Income: **-0.037** vs **-0.048** → mismatch
- Occupational prestige: **-0.020** vs **+0.025** → **sign flip**
- Female: **-0.057** vs **-0.027** → mismatch
- Age: **0.163** vs **0.210** → mismatch
- Black: **-0.132*** vs **-0.133***?  
  - Your coefficient is close (**-0.1328**) but your **significance is only “*”**, while true is *** → mismatch in inference.
- Hispanic: **-0.058** vs **missing (NaN)** → mismatch
- Other race: **-0.017** vs **+0.010** → **sign flip**
- Cons Prot: **0.063** vs **0.071** → mismatch (small)
- No religion: **0.057** vs **missing (NaN)** → mismatch
- Southern: **0.024** vs **0.017** → mismatch
- Constant: **2.415*** vs **2.657*** → mismatch

#### Model 2: Remaining 12 genres (true vs generated)
- Racism: **0.080** vs **0.008** → mismatch (near-zero in generated)
- Education: **-0.242*** vs **-0.205** ** → mismatch in size and significance (*** vs **)
- Income: **-0.065** vs **-0.098** → mismatch
- Occupational prestige: **0.005** vs **-0.026** → sign flip
- Female: **-0.070** vs **-0.079** → close (no stars either way)
- Age: **0.126** ** vs **0.132** * → mismatch in significance level (** vs *)
- Black: **0.042** vs **0.092** → mismatch
- Hispanic: **-0.029** vs **missing** → mismatch
- Other race: **0.047** vs **0.116*** → mismatch in size and inference (and likely not significant in paper)
- Cons Prot: **0.048** vs **0.097** → mismatch
- No religion: **0.024** vs **missing** → mismatch
- Southern: **0.069** vs **0.121*** → mismatch (size and inference)
- Constant: **7.860** vs **5.205*** → mismatch

**Root causes for coefficient/star mismatches:**
- Different analytic sample (your N is ~half of the paper).
- Different covariate set in practice (you dropped Hispanic and no religion).
- Different measurement (proxy conservative Protestant; possibly different racism scale; different coding of prestige/income).
- Possibly different estimation details (weights, handling of missing, standardization method).

**Fixes to make coefficients match:**
1. **Recreate the same variables with the same codings** as Bryson:
   - racism scale construction and direction,
   - income per capita definition (REALINC/HOMPOP must match exactly—same inflation adjustment, same household size variable, same transformations),
   - PRESTG80 source and missing handling,
   - exact race/ethnicity categorization,
   - conservative protestant classification rule.
2. **Use the same sample definition and missing-data rule** (almost certainly listwise deletion, but on the *correct* variables with available data).
3. **Apply weights if used in the paper** (GSS weight like WTSSALL or a year-specific weight), and compute standardized betas accordingly.

### 5) Standard errors: you can’t “match” them because the true table doesn’t report them

- **Generated results:** you show no SEs (good), but your instruction asks to compare SEs.
- **True results:** Table 2 **does not include SEs**.
- **Fix:** Remove any claim that SEs match Table 2. If you want SEs, compute and report them, but they will be an *addition* not verifiable against the published table.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatches / misleading implications

- **Generated output implies “dropped” variables are okay** (Hispanic, no religion), but in the paper they are part of the model. That changes substantive interpretation (e.g., racism effect may shift when ethnicity is included).
- **Fix:** In the narrative, state clearly: “Replication failed due to missing Hispanic and no-religion variation; results are not comparable to Bryson Table 2.” Or, preferably, fix the data/coding so they are included and rerun.

---

### Minimal checklist to get the generated analysis to match the true Table 2

1. Get a dataset extract that contains: DV items, racism scale items (to build racism score), education, REALINC, HOMPOP, PRESTG80, sex, age, race, Hispanic, region (South), religion/denomination (to derive cons prot and no religion).
2. Rebuild:
   - DV1 (0–6) and DV2 (0–12) exactly as Bryson,
   - Racism score exactly as Bryson,
   - Conservative Protestant and No religion from correct variables.
3. Use the same inclusion criteria to reach **N≈644** (Model 1) and **N≈605** (Model 2).
4. Run OLS, compute **standardized betas** (confirm your standardization matches Stata/SPSS defaults if that’s what Bryson used).
5. Compare coefficients and significance stars (based on p-values), not SEs.

If you share your codebook/variable mappings (especially racism_score, Hispanic, religion, weights), I can pinpoint exactly which construction steps are causing the biggest coefficient shifts (e.g., why occupational prestige flips sign, why racism collapses in Model 2).
