Score: 27/100
============================================================

### 1) Structural problems: the generated output is not comparable to the “true” table

**Mismatch A: You report SEs / p-values, but the paper’s Table 2 does not provide SEs.**  
- **Generated:** `p_value_reest`, `sig`, and implicitly SEs (since p-values require SEs/df).  
- **True:** only **standardized coefficients + significance markers**, no SEs in the table.
- **Fix:** If you want to match Table 2, **remove SE/p-value fields** and report **standardized betas with stars**. If you insist on p-values/SEs, you must **re-estimate from microdata (GSS 1993)** and then you will no longer be matching “Table 2 as printed,” but a replication.

**Mismatch B: Sample sizes and fit statistics differ greatly.**  
- **Generated Model A:** N=203, R²=.165, Adj R²=.117  
- **True Model 1:** N=644, R²=.145, Adj R²=.129  
- **Generated Model B:** N=197, R²=.194, Adj R²=.146  
- **True Model 2:** N=605, R²=.147, Adj R²=.130  
- **Fix:** Use the correct **GSS 1993 analytic sample** and the same **listwise deletion / weights** rules as Bryson (1996). Your N suggests you’re using a much smaller subset (wrong year, wrong filters, missing-variable handling, or you restricted to complete cases on extra variables not in the paper).

**Mismatch C: You mix standardized and unstandardized coefficients, but the published table is standardized only.**  
- **Generated:** both `beta_std` and `b_unstd`, plus an unstandardized constant.  
- **True:** standardized betas; constant is reported but in a standardized-coefficient table it’s not directly comparable to your unstandardized constant unless you replicate the exact DV scaling and estimation.
- **Fix:** To match Table 2, report **only standardized betas** (and the constant only if you can verify the DV is constructed identically).

---

### 2) Variable-name / row-alignment problems (very likely)

Your generated tables show **13 rows** (including constant) with **two rows having `NaN` beta_std** (one looks like a zeroed coefficient row, and one is the constant). The true models have **12 predictors + constant** (13 total rows), but **none should have NaN betas except the constant**.

**Mismatch D: An extra/incorrect row with `NaN` beta_std and `b_unstd = 0.000000` appears in both models.**  
- **Generated:** there is a line `NaN  0.000000  NaN` before the “Southern”/“Constant”-like rows.  
- **Interpretation:** this looks like a dummy variable that is **all zeros**, a dropped reference category that got printed anyway, or a failed standardization (SD=0).  
- **Fix:**  
  1) Ensure you are not printing the **reference category** of a factor as its own coefficient.  
  2) Check for **zero-variance predictors** after filtering. Drop them before standardizing.  
  3) Confirm your model matrix is what you think it is (e.g., in R: `model.matrix()`).

Because you did not print variable names in the generated tables, we can’t map each row with certainty—but we can still compare patterns to identify coefficient/sign mismatches below.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches by model (standardized betas)

Below I match by **position/order consistent with the paper** (Racism, Education, Income, Prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Constant). Your output appears to follow roughly this order, except for the mysterious NaN/0 row.

#### Model 1 (paper) vs Generated ModelA_table (beta_std)

1. **Racism score**
- **True:** +0.130**  
- **Generated:** +0.138 (p=.068; no star)  
- **Mismatch:** significance and (slightly) magnitude.  
- **Fix:** correct N/weights and DV construction; also match Bryson’s racism scale construction and coding.

2. **Education**
- **True:** −0.175***  
- **Generated:** −0.253**  
- **Mismatch:** magnitude too large; significance level differs (*** vs **).  
- **Fix:** education coding and sample; also verify standardization method and missing handling.

3. **Household income per capita**
- **True:** −0.037 (ns)  
- **Generated:** +0.024 (ns)  
- **Mismatch:** **sign is wrong**.  
- **Fix:** income-per-capita construction likely wrong (e.g., using total income not per-capita; reversed scale; logged vs not; coding of missing values).

4. **Occupational prestige**
- **True:** −0.020 (ns)  
- **Generated:** +0.005 (ns)  
- **Mismatch:** sign differs (small).  
- **Fix:** prestige measure may not be the same variable (e.g., using SEI vs prestige, or different occupational score).

5. **Female**
- **True:** −0.057 (ns)  
- **Generated:** −0.037 (ns)  
- **Close enough** directionally (not a “table mismatch” if you’re re-estimating, but it does not replicate).

6. **Age**
- **True:** +0.163***  
- **Generated:** +0.150*  
- **Mismatch:** significance weaker; slightly smaller.  
- **Fix:** again N/weights; confirm age in years and no top-coding/centering differences.

7. **Black**
- **True:** −0.132***  
- **Generated:** −0.192 (ns, p=.123)  
- **Mismatch:** significance and magnitude.  
- **Fix:** race coding or sample composition differs; also may be losing power due to your tiny N.

8. **Hispanic**
- **True:** −0.058 (ns)  
- **Generated:** +0.063 (ns)  
- **Mismatch:** sign wrong.  
- **Fix:** Hispanic indicator coding likely reversed or based on a different variable/definition.

9. **Other race**
- **True:** −0.017 (ns)  
- **Generated:** −0.009 (ns)  
- **Close** (direction/magnitude roughly similar).

10. **Conservative Protestant**
- **True:** +0.063 (ns)  
- **Generated:** +0.073 (ns)  
- **Close**.

11. **No religion**
- **True:** +0.057 (ns)  
- **Generated:** `NaN` row appears here or you have a missing coefficient row; then you have −0.023 (ns) one row later.  
- **Mismatch:** your “No religion” effect is either missing/failed or has the **wrong sign** (− vs +).  
- **Fix:** Fix the dummy coding for religion categories (must have the same base category as the paper) and remove any all-zero dummy being printed.

12. **Southern**
- **True:** +0.024 (ns)  
- **Generated:** −0.023 (ns)  
- **Mismatch:** sign wrong.  
- **Fix:** South variable coding reversed (South=1 vs non-South=1), or you used a different “region” definition.

13. **Constant**
- **True:** 2.415***  
- **Generated:** 2.823***  
- **Mismatch:** constant differs; but constants are not very meaningful to compare unless DV and coding match exactly.  
- **Fix:** ensure the DV is constructed exactly as Bryson did (count of disliked genres in that set) and you’re not scaling/transforming it differently.

#### Model 2 (paper) vs Generated ModelB_table (beta_std)

1. **Racism score**
- **True:** +0.080 (ns)  
- **Generated:** −0.013 (ns)  
- **Mismatch:** sign wrong (and near zero).  
- **Fix:** racism scale coding likely reversed or miscomputed; or DV is not the “12 remaining genres” count Bryson used.

2. **Education**
- **True:** −0.242***  
- **Generated:** −0.260**  
- **Mismatch:** star level (*** vs **).  
- **Fix:** N/weights/df.

3. **Income per capita**
- **True:** −0.065 (ns)  
- **Generated:** −0.068 (ns)  
- **Close**.

4. **Occupational prestige**
- **True:** +0.005 (ns)  
- **Generated:** −0.098 (ns)  
- **Mismatch:** sign and magnitude.  
- **Fix:** wrong prestige measure or coding.

5. **Female**
- **True:** −0.070 (ns)  
- **Generated:** −0.093 (ns)  
- **Direction matches**.

6. **Age**
- **True:** +0.126**  
- **Generated:** −0.006 (ns)  
- **Mismatch:** sign and significance (major).  
- **Fix:** age variable might be miscoded (e.g., centered then sign-flipped? unlikely) or you swapped row order / mis-labeled rows. Also could be that your DV is not the same.

7. **Black**
- **True:** +0.042 (ns)  
- **Generated:** +0.012 (ns)  
- **Close-ish**.

8. **Hispanic**
- **True:** −0.029 (ns)  
- **Generated:** +0.071 (ns)  
- **Mismatch:** sign wrong.  
- **Fix:** Hispanic coding/definition.

9. **Other race**
- **True:** +0.047 (ns)  
- **Generated:** +0.154*  
- **Mismatch:** much larger and significant.  
- **Fix:** race categorization differs; small N can also inflate SE patterns and coefficients.

10. **Conservative Protestant**
- **True:** +0.048 (ns)  
- **Generated:** +0.114 (ns)  
- **Different but same sign**.

11. **No religion**
- **True:** +0.024 (ns)  
- **Generated:** again there’s a `NaN 0.000000` row and then **+0.186** **(significant)**  
- **Mismatch:** magnitude and significance, plus row alignment issue.  
- **Fix:** fix dummy coding/reference group and remove the spurious all-zero variable.

12. **Southern**
- **True:** +0.069 (ns)  
- **Generated:** (likely the +0.186 row is Southern and the next is constant, or vice versa—your row order is unclear). If +0.186 is Southern, it’s far too large/significant.  
- **Fix:** confirm you’re using **Southern** as in the paper and that the row labeling is correct.

13. **Constant**
- **True:** 7.860 (no stars shown in your transcription; table shows constant but significance in standardized table can be omitted)  
- **Generated:** 7.077***  
- **Mismatch:** constant differs.

### 4) Interpretation mismatches (stars/p-values vs paper’s stars)

Even where coefficient signs match, your **significance markers do not** (e.g., Racism in Model 1 is ** in the paper but not significant in yours; Education is *** in paper but ** in yours). With your much smaller N, p-values will shift—so your generated interpretation will diverge.

**Fix:** If the goal is to match the *published* stars, you must replicate:
- the **same sample (N≈644/605)**  
- the same **variable construction** (DV counts; racism scale; per-capita income; religiosity categories)  
- the same **standardization** procedure  
- any **survey weights** (GSS weight variable and whether Bryson used it)

---

### 5) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Print variable names aligned to coefficients.**  
   Your current generated tables omit names, making mislabeling/row swaps likely. Output a labeled coefficient table.

2. **Remove the spurious all-zero/NaN predictor row.**  
   - Drop zero-variance columns before standardizing.  
   - Ensure factor coding doesn’t output reference categories as separate rows.

3. **Rebuild the DVs exactly as Bryson did.**  
   - Model 1 DV: count of dislikes among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}.  
   - Model 2 DV: count of dislikes among the other 12 genres.  
   If you used different genre lists, different dislike thresholds, or missing handling per item, you won’t match.

4. **Reconstruct “racism score” exactly as in the paper.**  
   This is the most likely reason for the Model 2 racism sign flip and Model 1 significance mismatch. Verify item wording, reverse-coding, scaling, and averaging/summing rules.

5. **Match coding for demographics:**
   - **Female:** confirm 1=female (paper uses “Female” as a positive indicator, but the sign is negative).  
   - **Southern:** confirm 1=South. Your Model 1 sign is flipped.  
   - **Race dummies:** confirm Black/Hispanic/Other with White as reference; confirm Hispanic is not embedded within race coding in your data extract.

6. **Use the correct year/sample and missing-data rule.**  
   Your N suggests you’re excluding many more cases than Bryson. Use the same wave (GSS 1993) and apply listwise deletion only on variables in the model, not additional variables.

7. **Standardize predictors the same way and report standardized betas (not mixed).**  
   Use standardized regression coefficients (e.g., regress on z-scored variables or compute beta post-estimation). Keep unstandardized coefficients out if your goal is to mirror Table 2.

If you paste (a) the **variable names in the generated coefficient order** and (b) your **exact coding formulas** for the two DV counts and the racism score, I can identify exactly which generated row corresponds to each Table 2 variable and pinpoint where the row-order/dummy-coding error is occurring.
