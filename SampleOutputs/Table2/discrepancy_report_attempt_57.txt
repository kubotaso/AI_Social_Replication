Score: 16/100
============================================================

### 1) Fundamental reporting/design mismatches (before any coefficient-by-coefficient check)

**Mismatch A: You reported SEs and t/p-values for the “true” table, but the true Table 2 has no SEs.**  
- **Generated:** `ModelA_full`/`ModelB_full` include unstandardized b, SE, t, p, and “beta_std”.  
- **True:** Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients only**, with stars; **no standard errors** are provided in the PDF table.  
- **Fix:** If the goal is to “match Table 2,” you must **omit SEs/t/p entirely** from the comparison output (or clearly label them as *computed from your replication dataset* and not from the paper). To match the paper exactly, produce a table with: variable name, standardized coefficient, stars.

**Mismatch B: Sample sizes (N) are wrong.**  
- **Generated N:** Model A `n=327`, Model B `n=308`.  
- **True N:** Model 1 `N=644`, Model 2 `N=605`.  
- **Fix:** You are not using the same analytic sample as the paper. To match:
  - Use **GSS 1993** only.
  - Recreate the **same DV constructions** (counts of disliked genres) and the same predictors.
  - Apply the **same missing-data rules** as Bryson (likely listwise deletion on the table variables).
  - Ensure weights (if used in the paper) match the paper’s approach (Bryson often uses GSS weights; if you didn’t, N can differ due to weight handling or subsetting).

**Mismatch C: Your models drop predictors as “zero variance” that exist in the paper.**  
- **Generated fit tables:** `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: hispanic, no_religion` for both models.  
- **True table:** includes **Hispanic** and **No religion** with nonzero coefficients.  
- **Fix:** This indicates a coding/subsetting error:
  - You probably filtered to a subset where `hispanic` is always 0 (e.g., restricted to non-Hispanic respondents), or recoded Hispanic incorrectly.
  - Similarly, `no_religion` is constant—likely because you filtered to a religious subsample or collapsed religion categories incorrectly.
  - Correct by rebuilding the indicators from the full sample used in the paper and verifying each dummy has both 0/1 values before regression.

**Mismatch D: The DV definitions and/or scaling likely don’t match the paper.**  
- The paper’s DVs are **counts of disliked genres** in two specific bundles (6 “minority-linked” genres; and the other 12 remaining genres).  
- Your DV names suggest something similar (`dislike_minority6`, `dislike_other12`), but the huge N discrepancy and dropped race/religion dummies strongly suggest the construction or filtering differs.
- **Fix:** Validate DV construction with frequency checks (min/max/mean) and confirm the exact genre set matches the paper.

### 2) Variable-name/order mismatches (table structure problems)

**Mismatch E: Your “paper_style” tables have unlabeled rows and NaNs.**  
- In both `ModelA_paper_style` and `ModelB_paper_style`, there are rows with `NaN` in `coef` (blank lines). That makes it impossible to align with the paper’s variables.
- **Fix:** Explicitly carry a `variable` column and ensure **every row corresponds to a predictor in the paper**, in the same order:
  1. Racism score
  2. Education
  3. Household income per capita
  4. Occupational prestige
  5. Female
  6. Age
  7. Black
  8. Hispanic
  9. Other race
  10. Conservative Protestant
  11. No religion
  12. Southern
  13. Constant  
  Then print coefficients and stars with no blank rows.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches: Model 1 (paper) vs your ModelA (generated)

Below I compare the **paper standardized coefficient** to your **beta_std** (since Table 2 is standardized). I also flag star/sign mismatches.

| Variable | True (std coef) | Generated (beta_std) | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.139* | **Stars wrong** (you have p<.05; paper p<.01). Coef slightly off. |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.260*** | Magnitude notably too large (more negative). |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | Close (ok). |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.030 | **Sign wrong**. |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.026 | Magnitude off (too small in abs). |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.191*** | Too large. |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.127* | **Stars wrong** (paper ***; you have *). |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | **dropped** (zero variance) | **Major mismatch** (variable missing). |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.004 | Wrong sign / near zero. |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.063 | 0.079 | Somewhat higher. |
| No religion | 0.057 | **dropped** (zero variance) | **Major mismatch** (variable missing). |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.022 | Close (ok). |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.654*** | Intercept doesn’t match (also intercepts depend on DV scale and sample). |

**Interpretation mismatch implied by these:** because several coefficients differ in sign/magnitude and key dummies are missing, any narrative interpretation (“racism increases dislike… black decreases dislike…”) will not align reliably with the paper.

**Fixes to make ModelA match:**
1. **Restore Hispanic and No religion variation** (fix subsetting/coding).
2. Ensure **standardization method matches** the paper: Table 2 uses *standardized OLS coefficients* (typically standardized predictors and outcome, or post-hoc beta). Your `beta_std` is NaN for constant but present otherwise—good—but it must be computed identically.
3. Ensure the same **coding**:
   - Race dummies: verify reference category (likely White).
   - Conservative Protestant definition (RELTRAD-style vs simple denom?)—misclassification will shift coefficients.
   - Income and prestige scaling: “per capita” implies household income divided by household size; if you used raw income, coefficients will differ.
4. Ensure the same **analytic sample** (GSS 1993; listwise deletion on those items; any exclusions consistent with Bryson).

### 4) Coefficient mismatches: Model 2 (paper) vs your ModelB (generated)

| Variable | True (std coef) | Generated (beta_std) | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.005 | **Sign and magnitude wrong** (paper positive; you near zero negative). |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.224*** | Close-ish (ok). |
| HH income pc | -0.065 | -0.095 | Too negative. |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.012 | Slight sign mismatch (small in paper). |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.091 | More negative than paper. |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.091 | Smaller and loses significance. |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.112 | Too large positive. |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **dropped** | **Major mismatch**. |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.132* | Too large and (in your output) significant when paper is not. |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.048 | 0.080 | Larger than paper. |
| No religion | 0.024 | **dropped** | **Major mismatch**. |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.142** | Much larger; wrong significance. |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.674*** | Not matching (and your constant is starred; paper constant shown without stars). |

**Big substantive interpretation mismatch:** In the paper, racism has a **positive** association with disliking “the 12 remaining genres” (0.080, not significant). Your model suggests essentially **no relationship** (slightly negative). That’s not a minor rounding issue—it signals a different sample, different DV, different racism scale, or different controls coding.

**Fixes to make ModelB match:**
- Same as ModelA (sample/coding), plus:
  - Verify the **“12 remaining genres”** list is exactly what Bryson used. If your 12-genre basket differs (e.g., you accidentally included/excluded one genre or used “don’t know” differently), the DV changes and racism’s coefficient can flip or shrink.
  - Confirm the **racism score** construction matches Bryson (items included, direction, scaling). A reversed scale or different item set can produce sign changes.

### 5) Fit-statistics mismatches (R², adjusted R²)

- **Generated:** ModelA R² = 0.1896 (adj 0.1639); ModelB R² = 0.1658 (adj 0.1377).  
- **True:** Model1 R² = .145 (adj .129); Model2 R² = .147 (adj .130).  
- **Fix:** With the correct sample/DV/coding, these should move closer. Right now the discrepancies are consistent with “different dataset slice + different variable construction.”

---

### 6) Star/significance mismatches (even when coefficients are close)

Even if coefficients were similar, your stars are based on your computed p-values, but the paper’s stars come from their estimation on their sample. Because your sample and coding differ, stars will not align.

- **Fix:** Once you reproduce the exact N and coefficients (within rounding), the stars should also align. Until then, do **not** claim significance matches the paper.

## Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Use the correct data**: GSS **1993** (not pooled years).
2. **Rebuild the two DVs** exactly as Bryson:
   - Model 1: count dislikes among Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin.
   - Model 2: count dislikes among the other 12 genres (verify exact list).
   - Decide how “don’t know,” “not asked,” and missing are handled (must match paper).
3. **Recreate the racism score** exactly (items, coding direction, scaling).
4. **Recode predictors to match**:
   - Education (years? degree?).
   - Household income **per capita** (income divided by household size).
   - Occupational prestige (which prestige score? scale?).
   - Race dummies with correct reference.
   - Conservative Protestant definition (ensure same classification rule).
   - No religion dummy.
   - Southern.
5. **Fix the zero-variance problem**: ensure `hispanic` and `no_religion` are not constant after filtering; remove any unintended filters.
6. **Output format**:
   - For “paper match” table: show only standardized coefficients + stars, **no SEs**.
   - Label variables and ensure ordering matches Table 2.
7. **Validate replication targets**:
   - Confirm N = 644 (Model1), 605 (Model2).
   - Confirm R² values close to .145 and .147.
   - Then compare each coefficient to within rounding (typically 3 decimals).

If you paste the exact variable mapping you used (how you coded racism, the genre lists, and any filters), I can point to the most likely specific coding step causing (i) the N halving and (ii) Hispanic/no religion becoming constant.
