Score: 11/100
============================================================

### 1) Model identity / sample-size mismatches (major)

**Mismatch**
- **Generated Model A N = 261** vs **True Model 1 N = 644**
- **Generated Model B N = 259** vs **True Model 2 N = 605**
- Because N is drastically smaller, *all* coefficients, constants, R², and significance markers in the generated output necessarily won’t match the published table.

**Fix**
- Reproduce Bryson’s **analytic sample** (GSS 1993 Music module) and **casewise deletion rules** used for Table 2. Concretely:
  - Use the correct survey year/module and the exact set of variables Bryson used.
  - Apply the same missing-data handling (likely listwise deletion across all predictors in each model).
  - Do **not** restrict to a tiny subset (261/259). Verify N by printing the number of complete cases for Model 1 and Model 2 and confirm you get **644** and **605**.

---

### 2) Dependent variables: labeling ok, but construction likely inconsistent

**Mismatch**
- Labels match the paper’s DVs, but the generated descriptives show:
  - DV1 mean ≈ **2.06** (full) and ≈ **2.02** (analytic) on 0–6
  - DV2 mean ≈ **3.78** (full) and ≈ **3.67** (analytic) on 0–12  
  These may or may not match Bryson; without Bryson’s descriptives we can’t prove mismatch, but the *sample N mismatch* strongly implies DV construction and/or filtering differs.

**Fix**
- Confirm the DV coding exactly matches Bryson:
  - Which response category counts as “dislike” (e.g., “dislike” only vs “neutral+dislike”)?
  - Which genres are included in each count (the 6 “minority-linked” and the remaining 12).
  - Whether “don’t know / not asked / inapplicable” are treated as missing (not zeros).

---

### 3) Variable name / category-definition mismatches

#### 3.1 “Hispanic” construction
**Mismatch**
- Generated: “Hispanic (derived from ETHNIC; if not derivable => unavailable)” and values appear in the analytic sample.
- True table has **Hispanic** as a standard covariate. In GSS, Hispanic is typically a direct variable (or derived consistently).

**Fix**
- Use the same Hispanic indicator Bryson used (likely a direct GSS Hispanic/ethnicity variable or a specific derivation). Document it explicitly and ensure it matches the paper’s coding.

#### 3.2 “Conservative Protestant” proxy
**Mismatch**
- Generated uses a **proxy**: `RELIG==1 & DENOM==1`
- True table has **Conservative Protestant** (a substantive classification; often derived from denomination/fundamentalism scheme, not a single RELIG/DENOM condition).

**Fix**
- Implement Bryson’s actual Conservative Protestant classification rule (likely based on denomination family, maybe FUND, or Steensland-style tradition coding / GSS RELTRAD-type scheme if available). A crude proxy will shift coefficients and significance.

#### 3.3 “No religion” wrongly dropped
**Mismatch**
- Generated: **No religion dropped (no variation)** in both models.
- True: **No religion is included** with nonzero coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**

**Fix**
- This indicates a coding bug:
  - You may have created `no_religion` incorrectly (e.g., all 0/NA in the analytic subset).
  - Or your sample restriction eliminated all “no religion” respondents (another symptom of the N=261/259 issue).
- Recompute `no_religion = 1[RELIG == 4]` (or the correct category Bryson used), confirm it has both 0 and 1 in the analytic sample, and do not drop it.

#### 3.4 “Southern” sign/direction differs substantially in Model 1
**Mismatch**
- Generated Model A Southern: **-0.0598**
- True Model 1 Southern: **+0.024**

**Fix**
- After fixing the analytic sample and coding, also verify REGION coding. Ensure the dummy is “South vs non-South” consistent with Bryson.

### 4) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **all coefficient mismatches** (Generated vs True). Even where signs match, magnitudes differ.

#### Model 1 (True) vs Generated Model A
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.141* | 0.130** | size +; sig wrong |
| Education | -0.259*** | -0.175*** | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.0126 | -0.037 | too close to 0 |
| Occ prestige | 0.0575 | -0.020 | **sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.0344 | -0.057 | too small |
| Age | 0.1749** | 0.163*** | sig wrong |
| Black | -0.1776* | -0.132*** | too negative; sig wrong |
| Hispanic | -0.0054 | -0.058 | far too small |
| Other race | -0.0057 | -0.017 | too small |
| Cons Protestant | 0.1212 | 0.063 | too large |
| No religion | dropped | 0.057 | **missing** |
| Southern | -0.0598 | 0.024 | **sign wrong** |
| Constant | 2.594*** | 2.415*** | too high |
| R² | 0.178 | 0.145 | too high |
| Adj R² | 0.142 | 0.129 | too high |

#### Model 2 (True) vs Generated Model B
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.0085 | 0.080 | **sign wrong** |
| Education | -0.165* | -0.242*** | too small; sig wrong |
| Income pc | -0.0789 | -0.065 | somewhat more negative |
| Occ prestige | -0.0827 | 0.005 | **sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.0832 | -0.070 | somewhat more negative |
| Age | 0.1247 | 0.126** | sig missing |
| Black | 0.0431 | 0.042 | matches closely (OK) |
| Hispanic | 0.0076 | -0.029 | **sign wrong** |
| Other race | 0.1243* | 0.047 | too large; sig wrong |
| Cons Protestant | 0.1420* | 0.048 | too large; sig wrong |
| No religion | dropped | 0.024 | **missing** |
| Southern | 0.1005 | 0.069 | too large |
| Constant | 5.186*** | 7.860 | far too low; sig mismatch |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.147 | close but not exact |
| Adj R² | 0.113 | 0.130 | too low |

**Fix (for coefficient alignment)**
- You cannot “tune” coefficients to match; you must replicate:
  1) the **same sample**,  
  2) the **same variable coding**, and  
  3) the **same model type** (standardized OLS betas).
- Once (1)–(3) are correct, coefficients should align closely (minor differences may remain if Bryson used weights or slightly different handling of missingness).

---

### 5) Standard errors and inference: required vs “true”

**Mismatch**
- User request asks to compare **standard errors**, but:
  - Generated output includes **no standard errors** either (only betas + stars).
  - True results explicitly state **the paper does not report standard errors**.

**Fix**
- Remove any claim that you matched standard errors to the paper (you can’t).
- If you want inference:
  - compute SEs/t/p from your regression output, **but label them as your computed SEs**, not “as reported in Bryson”.
  - Ensure star cutoffs match Bryson (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001, two-tailed).

---

### 6) Significance stars / interpretation mismatches

Even where coefficient magnitudes are somewhat similar, the **stars differ** widely (e.g., Racism Model 1 is ** in true but * in generated; Age Model 2 is ** in true but none in generated).

**Fix**
- Stars will not match until:
  - N matches (644/605),
  - correct variable codings are used (especially Conservative Protestant, No religion, race/ethnicity),
  - and you apply the same testing approach (OLS, two-tailed, same df; possibly weights/robust SE differences can alter p-values).

---

### 7) Constants and scaling inconsistency (esp. Model 2)

**Mismatch**
- True Model 2 constant **7.860** (no stars shown in paper excerpt; but it’s listed)
- Generated Model B constant **5.186***  
This is a large discrepancy and is also consistent with the wrong sample/DV construction.

**Fix**
- Rebuild DV2 and the analytic sample; confirm DV2 mean and distribution; then re-estimate. Constants in count-like DVs are very sensitive to sample composition and to whether predictors are centered/standardized (note: Bryson reports standardized *coefficients* but still reports an intercept on the DV scale).

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches Bryson (action checklist)

1. **Recreate Bryson Table 2 analytic samples** and confirm:
   - Model 1 complete-case N = **644**
   - Model 2 complete-case N = **605**
2. **Reconstruct DVs exactly** (definition of “dislike”, correct genre lists, missing handling).
3. **Fix “No religion”** so it is not dropped; verify variation.
4. **Implement Conservative Protestant correctly** (not the RELIG/DENOM proxy).
5. **Verify region dummy** (South) and race/ethnicity coding.
6. **Estimate OLS and report standardized betas** exactly as Bryson (and apply the same star thresholds, two-tailed).
7. **Do not compare standard errors to the paper**; the paper doesn’t provide them.

If you share the exact code you used to (a) filter to N=261/259 and (b) build Conservative Protestant / Hispanic / No religion, I can point to the precise lines causing each mismatch.
