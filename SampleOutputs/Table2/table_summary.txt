## Data source(s) relevant to Table 2
- **1993 General Social Survey (GSS)**, NORC; nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults.
- Musical taste items are part of the **1993 GSS culture module**: 18 genres rated on a 5-point like/dislike Likert scale (used elsewhere to create dislike counts).

## Table 2: What it is
**Table 2 title:** *Standardized OLS Coefficients from the Regression of the Number of Music Genres Disliked on Racism and Demographic Variables: General Social Survey, 1993*

**Unit of analysis:** respondent (GSS adult).

**Estimation method:** **OLS regression** with **standardized coefficients (beta)**; **two-tailed significance tests**.

---

## Dependent variables (two OLS models in Table 2)
Table 2 reports **two separate regressions**, each with a different dependent variable:

### DV1 (Model A): Dislike of “minority-associated” genres (count)
A count of the number of genres the respondent **dislikes** among the genres “disproportionately liked by Hispanic or Black respondents” (footnote a):
- **Rap**
- **Reggae**
- **Blues/R&B**
- **Jazz**
- **Gospel**
- **Latin music**

*(Operationalization described earlier: “dislike” + “dislike very much” counted; don’t know treated as missing in the construction of dislike counts.)*

### DV2 (Model B): Dislike of the “12 remaining” genres (count)
A count of dislikes across the **other 12** genres (i.e., the remaining genres from the 18-item battery, excluding the six above).

---

## Independent variables in Table 2 (same RHS in both models)
All variables included on the right-hand side (predictors/controls):

### Key focal predictor
- **Racism score** (scale 0–5)

**Racism scale construction (all dichotomous; summed):**
1) Objection to sending children to a school where > half the children are Black  
2) Favor/oppose busing for school integration  
3) Belief that Black–White socioeconomic differences are due mainly to discrimination (coded toward racism when rejecting discrimination)  
4) …due to lack of educational chance (coded toward racism when rejecting this)  
5) …due to lack of motivation/will power (coded toward racism when endorsing this)  
(Author notes: built from 1993 GSS racial attitude items; factor analysis used to drop one item; alpha reported elsewhere as .54.)

### Socioeconomic status controls
- **Education** (years)
- **Household income per capita**
- **Occupational prestige**

### Demographic and identity controls
- **Female**
- **Age**
- **Black** (indicator)
- **Hispanic** (indicator)
- **Other race** (indicator)
- **Conservative Protestant** (indicator)
- **No religion** (indicator)
- **Southern** (indicator)

## The regression models in Table 2 (explicit specification)
Let \(Y_{i}\) be a respondent’s dislike count.

### Model A (minority-associated genres)
\[
Y^{(A)}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{Racism}) + \beta_2(\text{Education}) + \beta_3(\text{Income pc}) + \beta_4(\text{Occ prestige})
+ \beta_5(\text{Female}) + \beta_6(\text{Age})
+ \beta_7(\text{Black}) + \beta_8(\text{Hispanic}) + \beta_9(\text{Other race})
+ \beta_{10}(\text{Cons Protestant}) + \beta_{11}(\text{No religion}) + \beta_{12}(\text{Southern})
+ \varepsilon_i
\]

### Model B (12 remaining genres)
Same RHS, but with dependent variable \(Y^{(B)}_i\) = dislike count for the 12 remaining genres.

## Table 2 coefficients and fit (as reported)
### Model A DV: Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin
- Racism score: **.130** **(p < .01)**
- Education: **−.175*** (p < .001)
- Household income per capita: −.037 (n.s.)
- Occupational prestige: −.020 (n.s.)
- Female: −.057 (n.s.)
- Age: **.163*** (p < .001)
- Black: **−.132*** (p < .001)
- Hispanic: −.058 (n.s.)
- Other race: −.017 (n.s.)
- Conservative Protestant: .063 (n.s.)
- No religion: .057 (n.s.)
- Southern: .024 (n.s.)
- Constant: **2.415***  
- \(R^2 = .145\), Adjusted \(R^2 = .129\), **N = 644**

### Model B DV: Dislike of the 12 remaining genres
- Racism score: .080 (n.s.)
- Education: **−.242*** (p < .001)
- Household income per capita: −.065 (n.s.)
- Occupational prestige: .005 (n.s.)
- Female: −.070 (n.s.)
- Age: **.126** (p < .01)
- Black: .042 (n.s.)
- Hispanic: −.029 (n.s.)
- Other race: .047 (n.s.)
- Conservative Protestant: .048 (n.s.)
- No religion: .024 (n.s.)
- Southern: .069 (n.s.)
- Constant: 7.860  
- \(R^2 = .147\), Adjusted \(R^2 = .130\), **N = 605**

## “Related” statistical methods tied directly to Table 2 (context)
- **Construction of dependent variables:** counts of “dislike”/“dislike very much” across genre subsets; “don’t know” treated as missing when building the overall exclusiveness measure (and cases with missing excluded).
- **Racism scale construction:** item selection plus **factor analysis** (mentioned as used to drop one item), then additive index.

If you want, I can also list (from the paper) which of the 18 genres fall into the “12 remaining” set by name, but Table 2 itself only labels the 6 “minority-associated” genres explicitly.
