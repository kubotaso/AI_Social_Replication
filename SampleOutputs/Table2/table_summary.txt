## Table 2 (Bryson 1996): what it is
**Table 2. “Standardized OLS Coefficients from the Regression of the Number of Music Genres Disliked on Racism and Demographic Variables: General Social Survey, 1993.”**

- **Data source:** **1993 General Social Survey (GSS)**, NORC (U.S. noninstitutionalized adults; stratified random sample).
- **Estimation/statistical method:** **OLS regression** with **standardized coefficients (beta weights)**; two-tailed significance tests.
- **Unit of analysis:** individual respondent.
- **Samples (listwise due to scale construction/availability):**
  - Model for minority-linked genres: **N = 644**
  - Model for remaining genres: **N = 605**

---

## Dependent variables in Table 2 (two OLS models)
Table 2 splits “musical exclusiveness” (a *count of disliked genres*) into two dependent variables:

### DV1: Dislike of minority-linked genres (count)
**“Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”**  
- Construction: count of genres (from this set of 6) rated **“dislike”** or **“dislike very much.”**
- Footnote: these are the **genres disproportionately liked by Hispanic or Black respondents** (author notes p < .001 used to identify them).

### DV2: Dislike of remaining genres (count)
**“Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”**  
- Construction: count of **“dislike”** or **“dislike very much”** among the other 12 genres (i.e., all genres not in DV1).

---

## Independent variables in Table 2 (all predictors used in both models)

### Key predictor
- **Racism score** (scale range **0–5**)
  - Built from 1993 GSS racial-attitude items (dichotomous), direction-coded consistently; one item removed after factor analysis.
  - Items used (as described in text):
    1) objection to sending children to a school where > half Black  
    2) favor/oppose busing  
    3) attribute Black–White inequality mainly to discrimination?  
    4) … mainly to lack of educational opportunity?  
    5) … mainly to lack of motivation/will power?
  - Reported reliability in text: **alpha ≈ .54**

### Socioeconomic-status controls
- **Education** (years)
- **Household income per capita**
- **Occupational prestige**

### Demographic / group-identity controls
- **Female** (indicator)
- **Age** (years)
- **Black** (indicator)
- **Hispanic** (indicator)
- **Other race** (indicator; reference category is non-Hispanic White)
- **Conservative Protestant** (indicator)
- **No religion** (indicator; implies omitted reference includes other religious categories)
- **Southern** (indicator)

## Regression models in Table 2 (explicit specification)
Let \(Y_1\) be the count of disliked minority-linked genres (6), and \(Y_2\) the count of disliked remaining genres (12).

### Model 2A (DV1)
\[
Y_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{racism})+\beta_2(\text{education})+\beta_3(\text{inc pc})+\beta_4(\text{occ prestige})+\beta_5(\text{female})+\beta_6(\text{age})+\beta_7(\text{black})+\beta_8(\text{hispanic})+\beta_9(\text{other race})+\beta_{10}(\text{cons prot})+\beta_{11}(\text{no religion})+\beta_{12}(\text{southern})+\epsilon
\]

### Model 2B (DV2)
Same RHS predictors as above, but with \(Y_2\) as DV.

## Table 2 reported results (standardized OLS betas)
(Stars as printed: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001)

### DV1: Dislike of rap/reggae/blues-R&B/jazz/gospel/Latin (N=644)
- Racism score: **.130** **  
- Education: **−.175***  
- Household income per capita: −.037  
- Occupational prestige: −.020  
- Female: −.057  
- Age: **.163***  
- Black: **−.132***  
- Hispanic: −.058  
- Other race: −.017  
- Conservative Protestant: .063  
- No religion: .057  
- Southern: .024  
- Constant: **2.415***  
- \(R^2 = .145\); Adjusted \(R^2 = .129\)

### DV2: Dislike of the 12 remaining genres (N=605)
- Racism score: .080 (n.s.)
- Education: **−.242***  
- Household income per capita: −.065  
- Occupational prestige: .005  
- Female: −.070

- Constant: 7.860  
- \(R^2 = .147\); Adjusted \(R^2 = .130\)

## “Related” (Table-2-adjacent) measurement details you may need for replication
- **Musical dislike inputs:** 1993 GSS asked ratings for **18 genres** on a 5-point Likert scale from “like very much” to “dislike very much.”
- **Coding into counts:** the author counts only **“dislike”** and **“dislike very much”** as dislikes.
- **Handling DK:** “don’t know” treated as missing (in main exclusiveness scale construction, cases with DK were dropped; for Table 2 the usable N differs due to racism-scale availability and/or module splits).

If you want, I can also list **exactly which 12 genres** are in the “remaining genres” set by subtracting the Table-2 six from the full Table-3 list of 18.
