Score: 28/100
============================================================

## 1) Sample size / model fit mismatches

### **Mismatch: N**
- **Generated:** N = 751 for both models.
- **True (Bryson Table 2):** Model 1 N = **644**; Model 2 N = **605**.

**How to fix**
- Recreate Bryson’s *analytic samples* separately for each DV (they differ because the DV is a count “among observed,” so missingness differs by model).
- Ensure you’re using the same inclusion rule as the paper: respondents must have valid data on the DV **and** all covariates in that model (listwise deletion is the default implied by classic OLS tables unless otherwise stated).
- Do **not** force the same N across models unless the paper did (it didn’t).

### **Mismatch: R² and Adjusted R²**
- **Generated:**  
  - Model 1 R² = 0.1018; Adj R² = 0.0885  
  - Model 2 R² = 0.0846; Adj R² = 0.0710
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R² = **0.145**; Adj R² = **0.129**  
  - Model 2 R² = **0.147**; Adj R² = **0.130**

**How to fix**
- Once the **correct samples** (N=644/605) and **correct variable construction** (esp. DV) are used, re-run OLS and recompute fit.
- Also confirm you’re producing **standardized coefficients** (see below). Standardizing *doesn’t* change R², but mistakes that often co-occur (wrong DV, wrong sample) will.

## 2) Variable-name/content mismatches

### **Mismatch: “Hispanic” is missing**
- **Generated:** Hispanic = NaN / “not available in provided extract”
- **True:** Hispanic is included in both models with nonzero coefficients.

**How to fix**
- Add the Hispanic indicator to the model exactly as Bryson specifies (Hispanic vs. omitted reference group, likely White non-Hispanic).
- Ensure the race coding produces **three dummies**: Black, Hispanic, Other race (with White as reference), matching the table.

### **Potential mismatch: Age naming**
- **Generated variable name:** `age_years`
- **True table label:** Age

This is only a labeling mismatch **if** `age_years` is truly age in years. But your **coefficients** are also off (see §3), so confirm construction/standardization.

**How to fix**
- Confirm Age is measured in years (not age categories, not centered, not logged).
- For matching the table, label it “Age”.

### **Potential mismatch: “Constant” treatment**
- Table 2 reports a constant; your generated output includes a constant too, but the **value differs greatly** in Model 2 and somewhat in Model 1. This signals bigger issues (wrong DV scaling and/or wrong sample).

## 3) Coefficient (and sign) mismatches — variable-by-variable

### Key: Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas), *except the constant is unstandardized*.
Your generated tables label coefficients as `Std_Beta`, but multiple values do not match Bryson’s standardized betas—so either:
1) you did not standardize the same way, and/or  
2) you used a different sample, and/or  
3) you built different variables (especially DV), and/or  
4) you ran a different model specification.

Below are **all coefficient mismatches** (generated vs true). I’ll list Model 1 then Model 2.

---

### Model 1 mismatches (DV = minority-linked genres count among 6)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.1029** | **0.130** ** | magnitude too small |
| Education | -0.1985*** | **-0.175*** | magnitude too large |
| Household income per capita | -0.0074 | **-0.037** | magnitude far too small |
| Occupational prestige | 0.0331 | **-0.020** | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.0490 | **-0.057** | slightly off |
| Age | 0.0903* | **0.163*** | magnitude too small + significance wrong |
| Black | -0.1550*** | **-0.132*** | magnitude off |
| Hispanic | NaN | **-0.058** | missing variable |
| Other race | 0.0212 | **-0.017** | **wrong sign** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.0812* | **0.063** | magnitude/significance mismatch (true is not starred) |
| No religion | 0.0447 | **0.057** | slightly off |
| Southern | 0.0344 | **0.024** | slightly off |
| Constant | 2.5199*** | **2.415*** | off |

**How to fix Model 1**
- **Use the correct N (644)** via correct listwise deletion and correct DV availability.
- **Include Hispanic**.
- Ensure **DV construction** matches Bryson exactly: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin Music (count among observed of 6).”  
  - If you accidentally counted “dislike” differently (e.g., treating neutral as dislike, reverse coding, different genre list, or requiring all 6 observed), betas will shift a lot.
- Compute **standardized betas** the same way: run OLS on the original metric, then report standardized coefficients (or standardize all predictors and DV before OLS—equivalent if done correctly, but constants differ).
- Confirm Occupational prestige direction: Bryson’s beta is **negative** (-0.020). If your prestige scale is reversed (higher = lower prestige), your sign will flip. That seems plausible given your Model 1 prestige beta is positive.

### Model 2 mismatches (DV = dislike of remaining 12 genres)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.0008 | **0.080** | magnitude essentially zero vs positive |
| Education | -0.1831*** | **-0.242*** | magnitude too small |
| Household income per capita | -0.0088 | **-0.065** | magnitude far too small |
| Occupational prestige | -0.0243 | **0.005** | wrong sign (though true is near zero) |
| Female | -0.0590 | **-0.070** | somewhat off |
| Age | 0.0744* | **0.126** ** | magnitude too small + sig mismatch |
| Black | 0.0143 | **0.042** | too small |
| Hispanic | NaN | **-0.029** | missing variable |
| Other race | 0.0376 | **0.047** | slightly off |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.0993* | **0.048** | too large + sig mismatch |
| No religion | 0.0093 | **0.024** | too small |
| Southern | 0.0802* | **0.069** | slightly high + sig mismatch (true no star shown) |
| Constant | 5.0042*** | **7.860** | very different; also true constant has no stars |

**How to fix Model 2**
- **Use the correct N (605)** (different missingness than Model 1).
- **Include Hispanic**.
- Verify the DV is exactly “12 remaining genres” and that you used the **same genre set** Bryson did (not 10, not 13, not excluding/including Latin by mistake).
- Fix Occupational prestige coding (sign issue suggests reversed scaling again).
- The huge constant mismatch strongly suggests the **DV scale differs** (e.g., you’re counting dislikes from 0–12 correctly, but Bryson’s DV may be scaled differently in his estimation sample because of “count among observed” vs requiring complete observation; or your “dislike” threshold differs). Rebuild DV to mirror the paper.

## 4) Standard errors: required vs impossible

### **Mismatch: Standard errors**
- **Generated request:** “Identify mismatches in … standard errors”
- **True:** Table 2 **does not report standard errors**.

**What you can and cannot do**
- You cannot “match” SEs to Table 2 because they aren’t provided.
- Any SEs you generate are not verifiable against this table.

**How to fix**
- Remove any claim that SEs were compared to the paper.
- If you still want SEs, present them as *newly computed* from your replication, but then you must:
  - use Bryson’s sample rules,
  - use identical variable construction,
  - and ideally the same weighting/complex survey corrections (if any—Table 2 doesn’t indicate, but you must check the paper methods section).

---

## 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches

### **Mismatch: significance stars**
Several variables have stars in your generated output that are not starred in Bryson (and vice versa). Examples:
- Model 1: Age is `*` in generated but `***` in true.
- Model 2: Racism score is blank in generated but is reported as 0.080 (no star) in true—so your p-value pattern is inconsistent anyway.
- Model 2: Conservative Protestant is `*` generated but no star in true.
- Model 2: Southern is `*` generated but no star in true.
- Model 2: Constant is `***` generated but true constant has no star shown.

**How to fix**
- Once coefficients and samples match, recompute p-values and apply the **same star thresholds** (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001, two-tailed).
- Don’t add stars to coefficients you did not test comparably (and don’t infer stars from magnitude alone).

## 6) Summary of the core causes (what most likely went wrong)

From the pattern (wrong N, missing Hispanic, prestige sign flips, much smaller income effects, huge constant mismatch in Model 2), the most likely problems are:

1) **Wrong analytic sample(s)** (you used a larger pooled N and/or different listwise deletion).  
2) **Hispanic not included** (specification mismatch).  
3) **Occupational prestige scale reversed** (sign flips).  
4) **DV construction not identical** (definition of “dislike,” genre list membership, and “count among observed”).  
5) **Standardization procedure not matching** (or labels say standardized but output is from a different transformation).

---

## 7) Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1) Recreate DVs exactly:
   - DV1 = count of dislikes among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}
   - DV2 = count of dislikes among the other 12 genres
   - Implement “count among observed” correctly (denominator differs person-by-person if items missing).

2) Recreate predictors exactly:
   - racism score, education, income per capita, occupational prestige, female, age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, conservative Protestant, no religion, Southern
   - White (non-Hispanic) omitted reference.

3) Run **two separate OLS models** with **listwise deletion** per model, yielding N=644 and N=605.

4) Report **standardized coefficients** (betas) exactly as in the table; keep constant unstandardized.

5) Compute and display R² and Adj R²; they should be ~0.145/0.129 and ~0.147/0.130.

If you want, paste your code (or at least your variable construction steps for the two DVs and “occupational prestige”), and I’ll pinpoint which step causes each specific discrepancy.
