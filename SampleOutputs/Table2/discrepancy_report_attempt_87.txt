Score: 12/100
============================================================

### A. Global/structural mismatches

1) **Wrong sample sizes (N)**
- **Generated:** Model A N=327; Model B N=308  
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605  
- **Fix:** Use the same analytic sample definition as the paper (GSS 1993; listwise deletion consistent with Bryson). Your generated Ns are roughly half, suggesting you either:
  - filtered the data incorrectly (e.g., dropped all respondents missing any music genre item rather than using Bryson’s construction), or
  - used a different wave/year, or
  - restricted to a subgroup.
  - Also check whether you accidentally used only those with complete cases on *both* DVs, instead of separate samples per model.

2) **Wrong dependent variables / wrong model labeling**
- **Generated model names:**  
  - `Dislike_Minority_Associated6` (ModelA)  
  - `Dislike_Other12_Genres` (ModelB)
- **True paper DVs:**  
  - Model 1: *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music*  
  - Model 2: *Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres*
- **Potential mismatch:** Your ModelB coefficients don’t resemble the paper’s Model 2 at all (racism sign/size; age significance; southern effect, etc.). This strongly suggests the DV(s) were not constructed identically (different genre list, different coding of “dislike,” different scaling, missingness handling).
- **Fix:** Rebuild the two DV indices exactly as in Bryson:
  - Confirm the exact set of genres included in each index.
  - Confirm how “disliked” is defined (binary dislike vs rating threshold; handling “don’t know”; etc.).
  - Confirm the DV is “number of genres disliked” (count), not an average, factor score, or standardized DV.

3) **Using p-values/SEs when the true table has none**
- **Generated:** provides `p_value_model` and implies SEs (through p-values) and stars.
- **True:** Table 2 reports standardized coefficients and significance markers only; **no SEs are reported**, so SEs cannot be “compared” to the table.
- **Fix:** If your goal is to match *Table 2*, do not claim SEs from the PDF. Either:
  - remove SE and p-value columns and match only standardized betas + stars, or
  - explicitly state SEs/p-values are from your re-estimation using microdata (and then you must match coefficients, N, and R² first).

4) **Wrong fit statistics (R² / Adj R²)**
- **Generated:**  
  - Model A R²=.1896 (Adj .1639)  
  - Model B R²=.1658 (Adj .1377)
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R²=.145 (Adj .129)  
  - Model 2 R²=.147 (Adj .130)
- **Fix:** Once DVs, sample, and coding match, R² should move closer. Big deviations are consistent with “not the same DV / not the same sample / not the same variable coding.”

5) **“Constant” handling is inconsistent with standardized coefficients**
- **Generated:** reports `const_b` (e.g., 2.6536; 5.6737) while also presenting a “beta_std” table where constant is NaN but starred.
- **True:** Table shows a constant (2.415***; 7.860 [no stars shown in your transcription for Model 2, but it is listed]).
- **Fix:** Be consistent:
  - If you report standardized coefficients, the intercept is typically the **unstandardized** intercept from the model on the original DV scale (as Bryson appears to do), not a standardized beta. Label it clearly as “Intercept (unstandardized)”.
  - Don’t put NaN for its coefficient if you are going to report an intercept value elsewhere.

---

### B. Variable-name / missing-coefficient mismatches (NaNs)

These are hard mismatches: the paper has values; your generated table has missing coefficients.

1) **Hispanic**
- **Generated:** `Hispanic` = NaN in both models (but a p-value appears in ModelB)
- **True:**  
  - Model 1: Hispanic = **-0.058**  
  - Model 2: Hispanic = **-0.029**
- **Fix:** This usually means Hispanic is:
  - perfectly collinear with other race dummies because you included all categories + intercept (dummy-variable trap), or
  - has zero variance after filtering (e.g., you subsetted to a sample with no Hispanics), or
  - miscoded as all missing.
  
  **Concrete fix:**
  - Ensure race dummies are coded with **one omitted reference category** (likely “White”) and include intercept.
  - Verify Hispanic exists in the analytic sample (frequency table).
  - Ensure “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race” are mutually exclusive and derived from the same race/ethnicity scheme used by Bryson.

2) **No religion**
- **Generated:** `No religion` = NaN (and p-values missing)
- **True:**  
  - Model 1: No religion = **0.057**  
  - Model 2: No religion = **0.024**
- **Fix:** Same likely cause: collinearity or miscoding.
  - If you have religious tradition categories plus “No religion,” you must omit one category as the reference (e.g., mainline Protestant, Catholic, etc.).
  - Check that “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” aren’t being created in a way that overlaps (they should be distinct dummies).

---

### C. Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches

Below I list each coefficient mismatch (generated vs true), including sign and magnitude problems. Even where the numbers are “close,” significance often differs because N/R² differ, indicating the model is not the same.

#### Model A (paper Model 1: minority-associated six genres)

- **Racism score**
  - Generated: **0.139*** (p=.0125; 1 star)
  - True: **0.130\*\***  
  - Mismatch: significance level (true is **p<.01**; generated only *), and coefficient slightly off.
  - Fix: match N=644 and correct DV construction; significance should align.

- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.2609***  
  - True: **-0.175***  
  - Mismatch: much more negative in generated.
  - Fix: likely education coding differs (years vs degree categories vs standardized coding), or DV differs. Recode education to match Bryson’s measure and standardize the same way.

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.03445**
  - True: **-0.037**
  - Close; probably acceptable once other issues fixed.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **+0.0303**
  - True: **-0.020**
  - Mismatch: sign flip.
  - Fix: prestige variable likely not the same scale (different occupational prestige index), reverse-coded, or mis-merged. Confirm you’re using the same prestige measure Bryson used (and same coding direction).

- **Female**
  - Generated: **-0.0258**
  - True: **-0.057**
  - Mismatch: magnitude (generated much smaller).
  - Fix: gender coding likely fine; discrepancy more consistent with DV/sample mismatch.

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.1912***  
  - True: **0.163***  
  - Mismatch: magnitude; both positive and significant.
  - Fix: align DV and sample.

- **Black**
  - Generated: **-0.1272*** (only *)  
  - True: **-0.132*** (***)
  - Mismatch: significance level and slightly different beta.
  - Fix: again points to smaller N / different DV, plus race coding differences.

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **NaN**
  - True: **-0.058**
  - Fix: see above (dummy trap / no variance / miscoding).

- **Other race**
  - Generated: **+0.0037**
  - True: **-0.017**
  - Mismatch: sign and magnitude (small, but not matching).
  - Fix: race coding scheme mismatch (who is in “Other”), or sample composition differs.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated: **0.0791**
  - True: **0.063**
  - Somewhat close.

- **No religion**
  - Generated: **NaN**
  - True: **0.057**
  - Fix: see above.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.02195**
  - True: **0.024**
  - Close.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: const_b **2.6536** and also “Constant NaN ***”
  - True: **2.415***  
  - Mismatch in intercept value and inconsistent reporting.
  - Fix: ensure you are using the same DV scale (count of disliked genres) and report intercept consistently.

#### Model B (paper Model 2: remaining 12 genres)

This is where the generated results diverge dramatically—strong evidence Model B is not the paper’s Model 2.

- **Racism score**
  - Generated: **-0.0051** (ns)
  - True: **+0.080** (ns)
  - Mismatch: sign and magnitude (near zero vs moderate positive).
  - Fix: DV definition mismatch is most likely (you may have reversed coding, used “liked,” or used a different genre set).

- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.2238***  
  - True: **-0.242***  
  - Close-ish (this one aligns better than most).

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.0954**
  - True: **-0.065**
  - Mismatch: more negative in generated.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **-0.0123**
  - True: **+0.005**
  - Mismatch: sign flip again (same issue as Model A).

- **Female**
  - Generated: **-0.0912**
  - True: **-0.070**
  - Mismatch: magnitude.

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.0914** (ns)
  - True: **0.126\*\***  
  - Mismatch: significance and size.
  - Fix: sample size and DV mismatch.

- **Black**
  - Generated: **+0.1122** (p≈.056)
  - True: **+0.042** (ns)
  - Mismatch: much larger in generated.

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **NaN** (but p≈.051 shown—internally inconsistent)
  - True: **-0.029**
  - Mismatch: missing coefficient + nonsensical p-value with no estimate.
  - Fix: fix collinearity/coding; also fix your table-generation code so it cannot output a p-value when beta is missing.

- **Other race**
  - Generated: **+0.132\***  
  - True: **+0.047**
  - Mismatch: much larger and becomes significant in generated.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated: **0.0803**
  - True: **0.048**
  - Mismatch: magnitude.

- **No religion**
  - Generated: **NaN**
  - True: **0.024**
  - Fix: collinearity/coding.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.1424\*\***  
  - True: **0.069**
  - Mismatch: about double and wrongly significant.
  - Fix: DV/sample mismatch (and possibly region coding).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: const_b **5.6737** (and “Constant NaN ***”)
  - True: **7.860**
  - Big mismatch → DV scaling/definition differs (e.g., your DV count max differs, or you standardized/centered it, or excluded genres).

### D. Interpretation/significance mismatches

1) **Star logic differs from the paper**
- Paper uses: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001 (two-tailed).
- Your stars often do not correspond to either the paper’s stars *or* your own p-values (e.g., ModelA racism p=.0125 should be “*” under that rule—OK; but true has “**”, which reflects different p from the true model).
- **Fix:** Once you replicate the exact model, compute stars from your own p-values using the same thresholds. But if you are matching the table, **match the stars in the paper**, not the stars from a mis-specified model.

2) **Claiming precision (p-values) inconsistent with the “true results” source**
- Since Table 2 doesn’t report SE/p, any “true” comparison for SE/p is impossible.
- **Fix:** Frame the goal correctly:
  - Either: “replicate standardized betas and significance markers” (paper-level replication), or
  - “re-estimate models from GSS microdata and report betas/SEs/p-values” (analysis-level replication), in which case the comparison target is not the PDF table alone.

---

### E. What to change so the generated analysis matches the paper

Use this checklist:

1) **Data**
- Use **GSS 1993** (same year as paper) and same weight decisions (if any).
- Match the paper’s **listwise deletion** rules *per model*.

2) **Dependent variables**
- Reconstruct the two DV counts exactly:
  - Model 1: count of disliked among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}.
  - Model 2: count of disliked among the **other 12** genres (confirm the exact list from the instrument/paper).
- Ensure “dislike” coding matches Bryson (e.g., whether “never heard” is excluded; whether missing is set to 0 or NA; etc.).

3) **Independent variables**
- **Standardize** variables the same way Bryson did to produce standardized OLS coefficients (typically standardizing all variables including DV or using software’s beta option; confirm which).
- **Education**: match exact measure (years vs degrees).
- **Prestige**: use the correct occupational prestige index and direction.
- **Race/ethnicity**: create mutually exclusive dummies with **White omitted**.
- **Religion**: create dummies with a clear omitted category; ensure “No religion” is not collinear.

4) **Model specification**
- OLS with the same covariates as table (k should align with paper’s included predictors + intercept).
- Don’t drop predictors due to collinearity; instead fix dummy coding.

5) **Output formatting**
- Don’t output NaN betas. If a coefficient is not estimated, the table should show it as “omitted (collinear)” and **no p-value**.
- If matching Table 2: report **standardized betas and stars only**, and note SEs not available from the PDF.

If you share (a) how you constructed each DV, (b) your race/religion dummy coding, and (c) which GSS file/year you used, I can pinpoint which specific step is causing the Model B sign reversals and the omitted Hispanic/No religion terms.
