Score: 33/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / variable-definition mismatches

**(1) “Education (years)” vs “Education”**
- **Mismatch:** Generated table labels “Education (years)”; Bryson’s table just says **Education** (and in GSS it is typically **EDUC** = years).  
- **Fix:** Rename for presentation only. Keep the underlying variable as years of schooling, but label it **Education** to match Table 2.

**(2) “Female (1=female)” vs “Female”**
- **Mismatch:** Labeling differs (fine), but ensure coding matches Bryson (Female=1).  
- **Fix:** Presentation rename to **Female**. Verify 0/1 coding and reference category (male).

**(3) Race/ethnicity variables: “Hispanic (ETHNIC==1 …)”**
- **Mismatch (likely substantive):** Generated Hispanic uses `ETHNIC==1` “if observed; missing if ETHNIC missing.” Bryson’s Table 2 uses **Hispanic** as a dummy alongside **Black** and **Other race**. In GSS, Hispanic is often built from **HISPANIC** or from **RACE** + **HISPANIC** (depending on year), not necessarily `ETHNIC==1`, and you typically should not set it missing just because ETHNIC is missing if you can infer non-Hispanic elsewhere.
- **Fix:** Reconstruct Hispanic exactly as Bryson did (or closest feasible):
  - Use the same source variable Bryson used (if replication notes say so; often **HISPANIC** indicator).
  - Create mutually exclusive dummies consistent with the table: White (reference), Black, Hispanic, Other.
  - Don’t introduce extra missingness by requiring ETHNIC if not required.

**(4) “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”**
- **Mismatch (very likely):** This proxy is almost certainly not Bryson’s operationalization. Conservative Protestant in GSS replications is typically derived from denominational classification schemes (e.g., Steensland et al. / RELTRAD) or more detailed denomination variables, not simply `RELIG==1 & DENOM==1`.
- **Fix:** Implement Conservative Protestant using a standard classification appropriate to 1993 GSS and consistent with Bryson (1996). If Bryson used FUND/EVANG categories or a denominational recode, follow that. At minimum:
  - Use a RELTRAD-style variable (evangelical Protestant vs mainline vs Black Protestant vs Catholic etc.)
  - Ensure **Black Protestant** isn’t accidentally folded into “Conservative Protestant” if Bryson treated race separately.

**(5) “No religion” dropped**
- **Mismatch:** True Table 2 includes **No religion** with coefficients (Model1=0.057; Model2=0.024). Generated results show **No religion = NaN** and “Dropped_no_variation no_religion”.
- **Fix:** This is a *clear construction error*. Either:
  - You coded `no_religion` incorrectly (e.g., filtered the sample to RELIG≠4), or
  - You set it to missing for everyone (e.g., `missing if RELIG missing` but RELIG missing everywhere due to wrong variable name/year), or
  - You computed it after listwise deletion so it became constant.
  - **Repair:** Recompute `no_religion = 1[RELIG==4] else 0` *before* subsetting; verify it has both 0 and 1 in the analytic sample; include it in the model.

**(6) “Southern (REGION==3 … missing if REGION missing)”**
- **Mismatch:** Definition likely OK (South is often REGION=3), but Bryson’s coefficient signs imply it matters how you code/handle missing.
- **Fix:** Ensure South dummy is 1 if South, 0 otherwise, and that “missing if REGION missing” doesn’t unnecessarily delete cases (or at least matches Bryson’s deletion rule).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are *every* coefficient mismatch relative to Bryson Table 2.

#### Model 1: Dislike of minority-linked genres (6)
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.1685 (**)| 0.130 (**) | **Too high** |
| Education | -0.2811 (***)| -0.175 (***) | **Too negative** |
| Income pc | -0.0298 | -0.037 | Slightly off |
| Prestige | +0.0774 | -0.020 | **Wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.0253 | -0.057 | Magnitude off |
| Age | +0.1688 (**) | +0.163 (***) | Sig level & tiny coef mismatch |
| Black | -0.1629 | -0.132 (***) | Magnitude & missing *** |
| Hispanic | +0.0319 | -0.058 | **Wrong sign** |
| Other race | -0.0030 | -0.017 | Small mismatch |
| Cons Protestant | +0.0680 | +0.063 | Close |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | +0.057 | **Missing entirely** |
| Southern | -0.0473 | +0.024 | **Wrong sign** |
| Constant | 2.5923 (***) | 2.415 (***) | Off |

#### Model 2: Dislike of remaining 12
| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.0396 | 0.080 | **Too small** |
| Education | -0.2336 (***) | -0.242 (***) | Close |
| Income pc | -0.0535 | -0.065 | Somewhat off |
| Prestige | -0.0112 | +0.005 | Wrong sign (small) |
| Female | -0.0711 | -0.070 | Essentially matches |
| Age | +0.0764 | +0.126 (**) | **Too small; missing ** |
| Black | +0.0399 | +0.042 | Close |
| Hispanic | +0.0458 | -0.029 | **Wrong sign** |
| Other race | +0.0929 | +0.047 | Too large |
| Cons Protestant | +0.1289 (*) | +0.048 | **Too large; wrong sig** |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | +0.024 | **Missing entirely** |
| Southern | +0.0945 | +0.069 | Somewhat high |
| Constant | 5.4992 (***) | 7.860 (no sig reported) | **Large mismatch** |

**How to fix coefficient mismatches (root causes):**
1. **Wrong sample / N** (see Section 4): your N is ~309/305 vs true 644/605. That alone will change standardized betas substantially.
2. **Wrong construction of key predictors** (especially Conservative Protestant and Hispanic) → sign flips and magnitude changes.
3. **Wrong DV construction and/or scaling** (counts, missing handling) changes betas and intercepts.
4. **Standardization mismatch**: ensure you are reporting standardized coefficients the same way (see Section 3).

### 3) Standard errors and “interpretation” mismatches

**(A) Standard errors**
- **Mismatch:** Your prompt asks to compare SEs, but **Bryson Table 2 reports no SEs**. The generated output also does not show SEs—only standardized betas and “Replication_Sig”.
- **Fix:** You cannot “match” SEs to Table 2 because they’re not available there. If you computed SEs internally, do **not** claim they are from Bryson. Only match betas + significance markers.

**(B) Significance stars (“Replication_Sig”)**
- **Mismatch:** Several star levels don’t match (e.g., Age Model 1 is *** in true but ** in generated; Black Model 1 is *** in true but blank in generated; Conservative Protestant Model 2 is nonsignificant in true but * in generated).
- **Fix:** Once you (i) replicate the **same N/sample**, (ii) reproduce **the same variable constructions**, and (iii) use the same **test assumptions** (two-tailed OLS, likely unweighted or weighted exactly as Bryson did), the p-values/stars should line up more closely.
  - Also verify you are using the **same df** (listwise deletion on same variables) and same **alpha cutoffs**.

**(C) Interpretation**
- **Mismatch risk:** The generated labels imply some variables are “proxy” or “missing if … missing,” which changes interpretation and is not Bryson’s model.
- **Fix:** Align the narrative to Bryson’s constructs (e.g., Conservative Protestant as a denominational tradition variable; Hispanic as ethnicity indicator; listwise deletion consistent with paper).

---

### 4) Model fit / sample size mismatches (major)

**(1) N**
- **Mismatch:** Generated N = **309 / 305**; True N = **644 / 605**.
- **Fix:** Your analytic frame is being cut roughly in half. The missingness table shows huge missing rates for racism_score (~0.373) and cons_prot (~0.363), and DV missingness ~0.29–0.34.
  - **Replicate Bryson’s inclusion rules**: same year(s), same age restrictions (if any), same handling of “don’t know/NA” for racism items and music dislikes.
  - Rebuild racism_score so you don’t lose so many cases (Bryson’s note: computed if **>=4 answered**, then rescaled). You did that, but you may be applying it after filtering or with wrong item coding leading to excess missing.
  - Fix Conservative Protestant coding to reduce artificial missingness (your proxy produces massive missingness).

**(2) R² / Adjusted R²**
- **Mismatch:**  
  - Model1: generated R²=0.189 vs true 0.145  
  - Model2: generated R²=0.152 vs true 0.147 (close), but Adj R² differs because N differs.
- **Fix:** R² will change with different sample and variable construction. Once N and variables match, R² should converge.

**(3) Constant**
- **Mismatch:** Model2 constant is dramatically off (5.50 vs 7.86).
- **Fix:** Intercepts are sensitive to DV scaling and sample. This strongly suggests your DV2 construction and/or sample differs from Bryson.

---

### 5) DV construction mismatches

**(A) DV names match conceptually, but scaling/availability likely differs**
- Generated DV means: DV1 mean ~2.06 (0–6), DV2 mean ~3.78 (0–12). That seems plausible, but the **constant** mismatch and **N** mismatch suggest different construction rules.
- **Fix:** Ensure:
  - Exactly the same set of genres included in each DV (and that genre variables correspond to the same survey questions Bryson used).
  - Same coding of “dislike” (e.g., whether “dislike” includes “strongly dislike” only, or includes “neutral”, etc.).
  - Same handling of missing per item: Bryson may have allowed partial completion (e.g., compute count if at least k of items answered) similar to racism_score; you appear to require complete data (your DV missingness is very high).

---

### 6) Presentation mismatches (variable order, labels)

- **Mismatch:** Generated tables include extra descriptive text in variable labels and “proxy” notes; Bryson’s table uses short names.
- **Fix:** For the final table intended to match Bryson, present variables exactly as:
  - Racism score; Education; Household income per capita; Occupational prestige; Female; Age; Black; Hispanic; Other race; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern; Constant; R²; Adjusted R²; Number of cases.

---

## Minimal “repair checklist” to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1. **Recreate the analytic sample** to hit N≈644 (Model1) and N≈605 (Model2).  
   - Verify year(s), respondent eligibility, and listwise deletion rules.

2. **Fix “No religion”** so it is not dropped and appears in both models.

3. **Recode Hispanic and race dummies** to match Bryson’s mutually exclusive categories and avoid sign flips.

4. **Rebuild Conservative Protestant** using an accepted denominational tradition classification consistent with Bryson (not `RELIG==1 & DENOM==1`).

5. **Match DV construction and missing-data rules** (likely allow partial completion, not complete-case across all genre items).

6. **Confirm you are reporting standardized OLS coefficients** (beta weights) in the same way Bryson did; do not introduce weights/robust SEs unless Bryson did.

If you paste your code (or at least: which GSS year(s), which variables for the racism index and music dislikes, and your exact recodes), I can pinpoint which specific step is causing each sign flip (prestige, Hispanic, southern) and the N collapse.
