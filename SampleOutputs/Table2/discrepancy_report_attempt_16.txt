Score: 19/100
============================================================

### 1) Fundamental incompatibility: you’re comparing *different models/data* than the paper’s Table 2
Your “generated results” cannot be a faithful reproduction of Bryson (1996) Table 2 because:

- **Different N**  
  - Generated Model A: **N=327** vs True Model 1: **N=644**  
  - Generated Model B: **N=308** vs True Model 2: **N=605**  
  This alone guarantees coefficients/p-values won’t match.

- **Different R² / Adjusted R²**  
  - Generated Model A: **R²=.1896, adj=.1639** vs True Model 1: **R²=.145, adj=.129**  
  - Generated Model B: **R²=.1658, adj=.1377** vs True Model 2: **R²=.147, adj=.130**

- **Different predictor set (you have 10 predictors; Table 2 has 12 + constant)**  
  Table 2 includes: Racism, Education, Income pc, Occ prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, **No religion**, Southern (+ constant).  
  Your models show **k_predictors=10** and also report **“dropped_zero_variance_predictors: no_religion”**. That means (at least) **No religion is missing**, and **one other Table-2 predictor is also missing**.

**Fix:** To match Table 2, you must (a) use the same GSS 1993 sample and construction rules Bryson used, (b) include the full set of predictors exactly as specified, and (c) replicate the same missing-data handling and weights (if any). Until N and the regressor list match, coefficient-level comparison is not meaningful.

### 2) Variable name/order mismatches: your tables have no variable names at all
Your generated coefficient rows are unlabeled, so we cannot map them unambiguously to the Table 2 variables. That is itself a discrepancy: the “paper-style” output should list the variables by name.

**Fix:**
- Ensure the regression output preserves and prints the **term names** in the same order as Table 2.
- Use an explicit variable order matching the paper:
  1) Racism score  
  2) Education  
  3) Household income per capita  
  4) Occupational prestige  
  5) Female  
  6) Age  
  7) Black  
  8) Hispanic  
  9) Other race  
  10) Conservative Protestant  
  11) No religion  
  12) Southern  
  + Constant

### 3) Missing predictor(s): “No religion” dropped + at least one more missing
- Your model fit object explicitly says **no_religion was dropped due to zero variance**.
- But in the true table, **No religion varies and is included** (Model 1 coef 0.057; Model 2 coef 0.024).
- Also: Table 2 has **12 predictors**, you have **10**, so you’re missing **one additional variable** beyond “no religion” (unless you combined/omitted categories like race dummies or region).

**Fix:**
- Check your coding: “no_religion” being zero-variance usually means a recode error (e.g., all 0 due to wrong value labels) or the sample got filtered to a subgroup with no “no religion” respondents.
- Verify the GSS religion variable mapping and the dummy creation.
- Ensure you did **not** subset to only religious respondents or accidentally drop “no religion” during cleaning.
- Add back the other missing Table 2 regressor (commonly this happens if you collapsed race categories or omitted “Southern”).

### 4) Coefficient mismatches (direction/magnitude/significance) vs Table 2
Even if we *guess* your row order corresponds to the Table 2 order, many coefficients don’t match. Examples assuming the first 10 rows correspond to the first 10 Table-2 predictors (and omitting No religion & Southern):

#### Model 1 (true) vs Generated Model A (examples)
- Racism: true **0.130** (**) vs generated **0.139** (*)  
  Not identical; also significance differs (** vs *).
- Education: true **-0.175*** vs generated **-0.261***  
  Much more negative in generated.
- Occupational prestige: true **-0.020** vs generated **+0.030** (sign flip)
- Female: true **-0.057** vs generated **-0.026** (different magnitude)
- Age: true **0.163*** vs generated **0.191*** (different magnitude)
- Black: true **-0.132*** vs generated **-0.127** (*) (stars differ)
- “Other race”: true **-0.017** vs generated **0.079** (sign flip)

These mismatches are completely consistent with you running the model on a different sample with different coding.

#### Model 2 (true) vs Generated Model B (examples)
- Racism: true **0.080 (ns)** vs generated **-0.005 (ns)** (sign and magnitude differ)
- Education: true **-0.242*** vs generated **-0.224*** (closer but not matching)
- Occupational prestige: true **0.005** vs generated **-0.012** (sign flip)
- Age: true **0.126** (**) vs generated **0.091** (ns) (lost significance)
- Black: true **0.042 (ns)** vs generated **0.112** (p≈.056) (wrong magnitude/significance)
- Southern: true **0.069** vs generated includes some **0.142** (**) somewhere (too large, wrong sig)

**Fix:** You need to replicate the paper’s:
- **DV construction** (exact genre sets, counting rules, any missing handling)
- **predictor coding** (especially race dummies, religion categories, “conservative Protestant” definition, southern indicator)
- **sample definition** (GSS 1993 only, adults?, complete-case vs other)
- **standardization method** (see below)

---

### 5) Standard errors: the “true” table has none, but your generated output implies inference from SEs/p-values
The true results explicitly state: **Table 2 does not report standard errors**—only standardized coefficients and significance markers.

Your generated tables contain **p-values and stars**, which implies you computed SEs (even if you didn’t print them). That is not inherently wrong, but it is **not comparable** to the published table unless you use the same SE method and sample.

Also, your “paper-style” output **omits SEs** (consistent with the paper), but then your stars come from your p-values, which are not necessarily the same as Bryson’s (since N/coding differ).

**Fix options:**
1) **To match the paper exactly:** report **standardized betas + stars only**, and do not claim “(with standard errors)” unless you actually have them from a different source.  
2) If you want to compute SEs anyway: label them clearly as **replication-computed SEs**, not extracted from the PDF, and ensure the sample/coding matches before expecting stars to line up.

---

### 6) Constant term mismatch (unstandardized)
- True constant (Model 1): **2.415***  
  Generated Model A constant: **2.653629***  
- True constant (Model 2): **7.860** (no stars reported in the transcription)  
  Generated Model B constant: **5.673737*** (very different)

Constants are extremely sensitive to:
- DV definition and scaling
- sample
- inclusion/exclusion of predictors
- centering/standardization decisions

**Fix:** Ensure:
- You are not standardizing the DV when the paper didn’t (Table 2 reports standardized *coefficients*, not a standardized DV mean of 0).
- You use the same DV count range and treatment of missing genres.
- Same predictors included.

---

### 7) Interpretation mismatch: “standardized OLS coefficients (with standard errors)”
Your “true results” header says “standardized OLS coefficients (with standard errors)” but then notes SEs are not in the PDF. That’s an internal inconsistency in the “true results” description (not your generated output).

**Fix:** Rewrite the “true results” description as:
- “Standardized OLS coefficients (significance markers); **standard errors not reported in Table 2**.”

---

### 8) The DV names don’t match Table 2
Generated model labels:
- `Table2_ModelA_dislike_minority6`
- `Table2_ModelB_dislike_other12`

True DV wording:
- Model 1: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”
- Model 2: “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”

Your DV naming is *close*, but you must verify the genre membership is exactly identical (e.g., whether “Blues/R&B” was coded as one item; whether “Latin” is exactly the GSS label; whether “Reggae” exists as such in that year; whether any genres were dropped due to missing).

**Fix:** Explicitly list the six genres and the twelve “remaining” genres in your code and output, and verify the count logic reproduces the paper’s DV distributions.

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the paper
Minimal checklist:

1) **Use the correct dataset/sample**
   - GSS 1993
   - Apply the same inclusion criteria as Bryson (1996)
   - Handle missing values the same way to recover **N=644 and N=605** (or explain precisely why not possible)

2) **Recreate variables exactly**
   - Racism score (same items, scaling, direction)
   - Education, income per capita, occupational prestige (same transformations)
   - Female, Age
   - Race dummies: Black, Hispanic, Other race (same reference category)
   - Religion: Conservative Protestant, No religion (same classification)
   - Southern

3) **Do not drop “no_religion”**
   - Fix recode/sample filter so it has variance and is included.

4) **Standardize coefficients the same way**
   - Standardized betas typically: run OLS on unstandardized DV with standardized Xs (or compute beta = b * sd(x)/sd(y)). Ensure your approach matches theirs.

5) **Output formatting**
   - Print variable names + standardized betas + stars.
   - Do not present SEs as “from Table 2”; if computed, label as replication-derived.

If you paste your variable list (names in your dataframe) and the exact model formulas you ran, I can map each generated row to a Table 2 variable and enumerate row-by-row coefficient mismatches unambiguously.
