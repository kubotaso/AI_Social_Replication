Score: 28/100
============================================================

### 1) Core structural problems (before coefficient-by-coefficient comparison)

#### A. **Sample size (N) is wildly wrong**
- **Generated:** Model A N=261; Model B N=259  
- **True (Bryson 1996 Table 2):** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605  
**Fix:** You are dropping far too many cases. To match Bryson, you must replicate *his* inclusion rules:
- Use the same survey year/wave and the same universe restrictions (e.g., adults only, valid genre battery, etc.).
- Use the same missing-data handling. Your diagnostics show very high missingness (e.g., racism_score ~47.6%, cons_prot ~36.3%, DV missing ~29–34%). Bryson’s N suggests he retained many more cases, meaning either:
  - he had less missingness in his analytic file, **or**
  - he used different coding that avoided converting many responses to missing, **or**
  - he used listwise deletion but started from a much larger pool than you are using.
Practically: **rebuild the analytic sample from the original GSS/year used by Bryson** and ensure the same variable availability.

#### B. **You dropped “No religion” entirely (and it exists in the true table)**
- **Generated:** `No religion (RELIG==4)` is `NaN` and flagged `Dropped_no_variation no_religion`
- **True:** No religion is included with coefficients (Model1=0.057; Model2=0.024)
**What happened:** In your analytic sample, `no_religion` has **only one unique value** (diagnostics show `unique_values_in_analytic_sample = 1`), so it was constant and got dropped.
**Fix:** This is almost certainly a **coding error**:
- In the GSS, `RELIG` codes are typically: 1=Protestant, 2=Catholic, 3=Jewish, 4=None, plus other/missing codes.
- Your sample somehow has no respondents with RELIG==4 (or you recoded them away).
Steps:
1. Recode RELIG carefully, treating “inap”, “dk”, “na”, etc. as missing—not as “not none”.
2. Verify frequency: `tab RELIG` before constructing `no_religion`.
3. Construct `no_religion = 1 if RELIG==4 else 0` **after** missing handling.
4. Ensure your sample includes RELIG==4 cases (i.e., don’t filter them out earlier).

#### C. **Your “Hispanic” variable definition does not match the table**
- **Generated label:** “Hispanic (ETHNIC==1 if observed; other observed ETHNIC -> 0; missing ETHNIC -> missing)”
- **True table variable:** “Hispanic” (standard race/ethnicity dummy in Bryson’s setup)
**Likely mismatch:** Bryson likely used a different ethnicity indicator and/or treated missing ethnicity differently (often missing is not set to missing for a dummy; sometimes it’s set to 0 with a separate missing flag—though the table doesn’t show such a flag).
**Fix:** Use the same coding scheme as Bryson:
- Identify which GSS variable/year he used for Hispanic ethnicity and how missing was handled.
- Ensure Hispanic is coded consistently with “Black,” “Other race,” etc. (mutually exclusive categories with White as reference).

#### D. **Religious tradition coding for “Conservative Protestant” is likely wrong**
- **Generated:** “proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1”
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant” in Bryson is not “any Protestant & DENOM==1.” It usually uses a denomination/fundamentalist classification (often based on detailed denomination codes, sometimes using STEENSLAND-type traditions—though Bryson predates that formalization).
**Fix:** Implement the same “Conservative Protestant” classification rule Bryson used (likely based on denomination family). Your proxy will change both coefficient size and significance.

#### E. **You are reporting significance stars, but Table 2 does not report SEs (still has stars)**
This isn’t inherently wrong—Bryson prints significance stars without showing SEs—but your stars must match Bryson’s p-value cutoffs *from his model*. With wrong N/coding, your stars will not match.
**Fix:** Once the model and sample match, compute p-values from OLS t-tests and apply the same thresholds (*, **, ***).

### 2) Variable name mismatches (Generated vs True)

| True table variable | Generated variable/label | Problem | How to fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Racism score | “Racism score (0–5; strict sum of 5 dichotomies)” | Likely different construction than Bryson | Rebuild racism scale exactly as Bryson (items, coding, handling DK/NA, and summation rules) |
| Education | `educ` “Education (years)” | Name ok, but coefficient differs strongly | Verify years coding and sample |
| Household income per capita | `income_pc = REALINC/HOMPOP` | Likely not Bryson’s exact income measure/transform | Confirm Bryson’s income variable and whether per-capita, logged, bracket midpoints, etc. |
| Occupational prestige | `prestg80` PRESTG80 | likely ok | Ensure same prestige variable and year-specific mapping |
| Female | `female` | ok | Ensure 1=female 0=male |
| Age | `age` | ok | Ensure age coding same and inclusion criteria |
| Black / Hispanic / Other race | `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` | Hispanic and race scheme likely mismatched | Use Bryson’s mutually exclusive scheme and reference category |
| Conservative Protestant | `cons_prot` proxy | definition mismatch | Implement Bryson’s denomination classification |
| No religion | `no_religion` dropped | coding/sample error | Fix RELIG coding and sample inclusion |
| Southern | `southern (REGION==3)` | may be ok but sign differs | Confirm region coding and South definition |

### 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 1 / ModelA)

True Model 1 coefficients vs Generated ModelA (Std_Beta):

- **Racism score:** True **0.130\*\*** vs Generated **0.143\***  
  - Magnitude close-ish, but **significance level mismatch** (**, not *).
  - **Fix:** Match N=644 and exact racism coding; p-values will change.

- **Education:** True **-0.175\*\*\*** vs Generated **-0.260\*\*\***  
  - Too large in magnitude.
  - **Fix:** sample/coding; also your DV construction may differ.

- **Household income per capita:** True **-0.037** vs Generated **-0.013**  
  - Too small in magnitude.
  - **Fix:** income measure likely not identical (and your N is much smaller).

- **Occupational prestige:** True **-0.020** vs Generated **+0.057**  
  - **Sign flip**.
  - **Fix:** likely sample restriction or prestige variable mismatch; verify PRESTG80 coding and missing handling.

- **Female:** True **-0.057** vs Generated **-0.035**  
  - Smaller magnitude.
  - **Fix:** sample/coding.

- **Age:** True **0.163\*\*\*** vs Generated **0.174\*\***  
  - Coefficient close; **significance mismatch** (*** vs **).
  - **Fix:** N/coding affects SE → p-value.

- **Black:** True **-0.132\*\*\*** vs Generated **-0.200 (no stars)**  
  - Much more negative but not significant in your run—this is a classic sign of **low power due to tiny N** or coding differences.
  - **Fix:** restore N and race/ethnicity coding.

- **Hispanic:** True **-0.058** vs Generated **+0.030**  
  - **Sign flip**.
  - **Fix:** Hispanic dummy definition is not Bryson’s.

- **Other race:** True **-0.017** vs Generated **-0.005**  
  - Close-ish but not exact.
  - **Fix:** race coding + N.

- **Conservative Protestant:** True **0.063** vs Generated **0.118**  
  - Too large.
  - **Fix:** your proxy definition differs from Bryson’s.

- **No religion:** True **0.057** vs Generated **dropped/NaN**  
  - **Major mismatch**.
  - **Fix:** fix RELIG coding and do not drop the variable.

- **Southern:** True **0.024** vs Generated **-0.060**  
  - **Sign flip**.
  - **Fix:** region coding or sample definition of “South,” plus N.

- **Constant:** True **2.415\*\*\*** vs Generated **2.600\*\*\***  
  - Different but not insane; still mismatch.
  - **Fix:** DV scaling and sample.

- **R² / Adj R²:** True **0.145 / 0.129** vs Generated **0.178 / 0.142**  
  - Generated fit is higher.
  - **Fix:** with tiny N and possibly different DV construction, R² can shift; match DV and sample.

### 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 2 / ModelB)

True Model 2 vs Generated ModelB:

- **Racism score:** True **0.080** vs Generated **-0.009**  
  - **Sign flip**.
  - **Fix:** racism scale construction + sample; also DV construction must match the “12 remaining genres” set.

- **Education:** True **-0.242\*\*\*** vs Generated **-0.165\***  
  - Much smaller magnitude and weaker significance.
  - **Fix:** N/coding/DV mismatch.

- **Household income per capita:** True **-0.065** vs Generated **-0.079**  
  - Close direction, magnitude somewhat plausible.

- **Occupational prestige:** True **0.005** vs Generated **-0.083**  
  - **Sign flip**.
  - **Fix:** prestige coding/sample.

- **Female:** True **-0.070** vs Generated **-0.084**  
  - Close-ish.

- **Age:** True **0.126\*\*** vs Generated **0.125 (no stars)**  
  - Coefficient matches extremely well; **significance mismatch** due to N/SE differences.
  - **Fix:** restore N.

- **Black:** True **0.042** vs Generated **0.025**  
  - Close-ish.

- **Hispanic:** True **-0.029** vs Generated **+0.018**  
  - **Sign flip**.
  - **Fix:** Hispanic coding.

- **Other race:** True **0.047** vs Generated **0.124\***  
  - Too large and significant when it shouldn’t be (no star in Bryson).
  - **Fix:** race coding + N.

- **Conservative Protestant:** True **0.048** vs Generated **0.141\***  
  - Too large and significant.
  - **Fix:** cons_prot definition mismatch.

- **No religion:** True **0.024** vs Generated **dropped/NaN**
  - **Major mismatch**.
  - **Fix:** RELIG coding/sample.

- **Southern:** True **0.069** vs Generated **0.101**  
  - Direction correct, magnitude larger; significance differs (Bryson shows none).
  - **Fix:** region coding + N.

- **Constant:** True **7.860** vs Generated **5.198\*\*\***  
  - Very different (and Bryson shows no stars here).
  - **Fix:** DV construction/scaling mismatch is likely (your DV mean is much lower if constant is ~5 vs ~7.9), and/or you standardized differently or used different base categories.

- **R² / Adj R²:** True **0.147 / 0.130** vs Generated **0.151 / 0.113**
  - R² similar; Adj R² much lower in generated (tiny N penalizes).
  - **Fix:** restore N.

### 5) Interpretation mismatches (what your generated output would imply vs Bryson)

Even if you didn’t write narrative interpretation, the *implied findings* differ:

- **Racism effect on Model 2:**  
  - True: positive (0.080), though not significant.  
  - Generated: essentially zero/negative.  
  **Fix:** correct racism scale + genre set for DV2 + restore sample.

- **Prestige effects:**  
  - True: near zero in Model 2 (+0.005) and slightly negative in Model 1 (-0.020).  
  - Generated: negative and sizable in Model 2 (-0.083) and positive in Model 1 (+0.057).  
  **Fix:** prestige coding and sample; ensure standardized betas computed correctly from the *unstandardized* OLS with the correct analytic N.

- **South:**  
  - True: small positive in both models (0.024; 0.069).  
  - Generated: negative in Model A (-0.060).  
  **Fix:** REGION coding and sample; confirm South definition.

- **Hispanic:**  
  - True: negative in both models (-0.058; -0.029).  
  - Generated: positive in both.  
  **Fix:** ethnicity coding.

### 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1. **Use the correct dataset/year and filters** Bryson used (Table 2 is Bryson 1996; ensure the exact GSS year(s) and the music-preference module year).
2. **Recreate the dependent variables exactly:**
   - DV1: count of dislikes for exactly {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}
   - DV2: count of dislikes for the other 12 genres (and ensure the total genre list matches Bryson’s instrument).
   - Confirm the dislike coding (e.g., “dislike” vs “strongly dislike,” treatment of “neutral/don’t know”).
3. **Recreate racism scale exactly** (items, dichotomization thresholds, treatment of missing/DK).
4. **Fix RELIG and “No religion”:**
   - Correct RELIG recode
   - Ensure “none” cases exist in analytic sample
   - Include `no_religion` as a dummy (White/Protestant? etc. depends on Bryson’s reference setup)
5. **Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies** to match Bryson’s scheme (White omitted reference; Black, Hispanic, Other).
6. **Recode Conservative Protestant** using Bryson’s definition (not RELIG==1 & DENOM==1).
7. **Handle missingness to recover Bryson-like N** (listwise deletion on the correct variables should land near N=644/605 if everything is coded correctly and you’re using the right starting sample).
8. **Run OLS and report standardized coefficients** (beta weights). Confirm you are standardizing the same way:
   - Either regress on standardized X and standardized Y, or compute betas from unstandardized coefficients via \( \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{s_{x_j}}{s_y} \).
9. **Apply significance stars** using Bryson’s thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001, two-tailed).

If you share (a) the exact source dataset/year, (b) your code for constructing racism_score, the two DVs, RELIG/DENOM, and the race variables, I can pinpoint which recode(s) are causing the biggest sign flips (prestige, hispanic, south, racism in Model 2) and tell you exactly what to change line-by-line.
