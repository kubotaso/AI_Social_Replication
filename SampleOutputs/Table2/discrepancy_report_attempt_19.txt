Score: 40/100
============================================================

### 1) Table structure / reporting mismatches

**Mismatch 1.1 — You report SEs/p-values, but the “true” table does not include SEs**
- **Generated:** `p_value_replication` and significance stars derived from those p-values.
- **True:** Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients only** (and stars). **No SEs are reported** in the PDF, so you cannot “replicate” SEs from Table 2.
- **Fix:** If your goal is to match Table 2, **drop SEs/p-values entirely** and report only standardized betas + stars **computed from your model** (but then it’s not a replication of SEs—only of signs/magnitudes/stars). If your goal is an actual replication, you must use the original microdata and reproduce the model; then you can compute SEs, but they still won’t “match Table 2” because Table 2 never printed them.

**Mismatch 1.2 — You include a blank “No religion” row with coefficient 0.000**
- **Generated:** “No religion” appears as empty in the pretty table, and in the full table there’s a row with `b_unstd = 0.000000` and `NaN` p-value.
- **True:** “No religion” has nonzero coefficients (Model 1: **0.057**, Model 2: **0.024**).
- **Fix:** Your “No religion” regressor is not being estimated. Common causes:
  - It’s perfectly collinear with other religion dummies (e.g., you included **all** religion categories plus an intercept).
  - It got dropped due to missingness / zero variance after filtering.
- **Concrete fix:** Ensure a correct reference category:
  - Include intercept + **K−1** religion dummies (omit the reference group).
  - Verify the “no religion” dummy is coded 1/0 and varies in the estimation sample.

### 2) Sample size and model definition mismatches (these drive many coefficient differences)

**Mismatch 2.1 — N is wrong in both models**
- **Generated:** Model A `n=444`; Model B `n=446`.
- **True:** Model 1 `N=644`; Model 2 `N=605`.
- **Fix:** Your estimation sample is much smaller, meaning your filtering/listwise deletion differs from Bryson’s. To align:
  1. Use **GSS 1993** only (as in the paper).
  2. Recreate the **DV construction** exactly (count of disliked genres in each set).
  3. Apply the **same missing-data rules** (likely listwise on the variables in the model, but you must match the paper’s exact items and coding).
  4. Confirm you did not accidentally restrict to respondents with complete data on extra variables not in Table 2 (that would shrink N).
  5. Check you did not inadvertently subset on race, region, music questions, etc.

**Mismatch 2.2 — DV composition likely mismatched**
- **Generated model names:** `dislike_minority6` and `dislike_other12` suggest you intended the right DVs, but your constants and some patterns suggest the underlying count scales may not match Bryson’s.
- **True:** Model 1 DV is number of disliked among **6 specific genres**; Model 2 is among the **12 remaining genres**.
- **Fix:** Verify:
  - Each genre “dislike” indicator matches the paper’s definition (e.g., “dislike” vs “not like”, treatment of neutral responses, DK/NA).
  - Sum ranges: DV1 should be 0–6; DV2 should be 0–12.
  - Use the same “disliked” cutpoint the paper used.

### 3) Variable name / inclusion mismatches

**Mismatch 3.1 — Hispanic is missing in generated tables**
- **Generated:** No “Hispanic” row in either model.
- **True:** Hispanic is included in both models (Model1: **-0.058**; Model2: **-0.029**).
- **Fix:** Add the Hispanic dummy (or the paper’s ethnicity variable) and ensure race/ethnicity dummies are coded with a clear reference group. If you collapsed Hispanic into “Other race” or excluded it, you will not match Table 2.

**Mismatch 3.2 — “Education (years)” label vs “Education”**
- **Generated label:** “Education (years)”
- **True label:** “Education”
- This is mostly cosmetic, but it can signal a deeper coding mismatch: Bryson may have used years, but you must confirm.
- **Fix:** Confirm education coding exactly matches GSS/author coding (e.g., highest year completed). Rename label to match the paper if you’re reproducing the table.

**Mismatch 3.3 — Race dummies mismatch (you have Black & Other race; paper has Black, Hispanic, Other race)**
- This is a substantive mismatch (see 3.1).
- **Fix:** Use three dummies (Black, Hispanic, Other) with White non-Hispanic as the reference (typical).

### 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (standardized coefficients)

Below I compare your **standardized betas** (from `ModelA_table_full`/`ModelB_table_full` and the styled tables) to the **true standardized coefficients**.

#### Model 1 (paper) vs your Model A

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.132** | Close (OK) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.262*** | Too negative (magnitude off) |
| Household income pc | -0.037 | -0.037 | Matches (OK) |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | 0.074 | Wrong sign and magnitude |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.008 | Much closer to 0 than true |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.096* | Too small; wrong significance |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.155** | Too negative; star level differs |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | (missing) | Omitted variable |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.032 | Wrong sign |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.068 | Close (OK) |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0 (dropped/blank) | Not estimated |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.019 | Close (OK) |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.724*** | Too high |

**Interpretation mismatch for Model 1:** Your narrative/stars imply stronger education effects and weaker age effects than the paper. But since your N is 444 (not 644) and you are missing Hispanic and No religion, you are effectively estimating a *different model on a different sample*, so interpretation is not comparable.

**Fixes to make Model A match:**
1. Restore **Hispanic** and **No religion** correctly.
2. Fix collinearity/reference categories (especially religion and race/ethnicity).
3. Match the sample definition (N≈644).
4. Recheck coding of occupational prestige and female (female might be reversed, or prestige scale differs).
5. Ensure you are reporting **standardized coefficients** in the same way as the paper (standardize Xs and Y, or compute beta from unstandardized coefficients using SDs).

#### Model 2 (paper) vs your Model B

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | 0.003 | Much too small |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.224*** | Somewhat close (OK-ish) |
| Household income pc | -0.065 | -0.053 | Close |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.049 | Wrong sign |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.070 | Matches (OK) |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.051 | Too small; wrong significance |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.067 | Too large; significance differs (paper: none) |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | (missing) | Omitted variable |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.068 | Too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.111* | Much too large; becomes significant |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0 (dropped/blank) | Not estimated |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.113* | Too large; becomes significant |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.834*** | Far off; stars differ (paper shows no stars) |

**Fixes to make Model B match:**
- Same structural fixes as Model A (restore Hispanic/No religion, fix collinearity, match sample to N≈605).
- Recheck DV2 construction: your intercept being **much smaller** than 7.860 suggests your DV “count disliked among 12 genres” may be scaled differently (e.g., you might be counting “likes” or using 0/1 in the opposite direction, or using fewer/more genres due to missing items).

### 5) Significance/interpretation mismatches (stars)

Because Table 2’s stars are based on Bryson’s estimation sample and your stars are based on your p-values from a different model/sample, many star mismatches are expected.

Key star mismatches:
- **Model 1 Age:** True `0.163***`; Generated `0.096*`.
- **Model 1 Black:** True `-0.132***`; Generated `-0.155**`.
- **Model 2 Racism:** True `0.080` (ns); Generated `0.003` (ns) — but the magnitude mismatch matters.
- **Model 2 Age:** True `0.126**`; Generated `0.051` (ns).
- **Model 2 Conservative Protestant:** True `0.048` (ns); Generated `0.111*` (significant).
- **Model 2 Southern:** True `0.069` (ns); Generated `0.113*` (significant).
- **Fix:** Don’t try to “force” stars to match by tweaking thresholds. Instead, fix the **model specification, coding, and sample**; stars will follow.

---

### 6) R² / Adjusted R² mismatches

- **Model 1:** Generated R²=0.145 matches true R²=.145 closely, but adj R² is off (0.125 vs 0.129) and **N is wrong**, so this is likely coincidence.
- **Model 2:** Generated R²=0.137 vs true .147 (off).
- **Fix:** Once you match N and the covariates exactly, R² should be close. If R² differs after that, DV construction still differs.

### 7) What to change in the generated analysis so it *matches the paper table*

1. **Use the correct sample**: GSS 1993; reproduce the paper’s inclusion rules until N=644 (Model1) and N=605 (Model2).
2. **Rebuild both DVs exactly** (0–6 and 0–12 disliked-genre counts) using the same response coding.
3. **Include the full set of covariates** shown in Table 2:
   - Racism score, education, income per capita, occupational prestige, female, age,
   - Black, Hispanic, Other race,
   - Conservative Protestant, No religion,
   - Southern,
   - Constant.
4. **Fix dummy-variable traps**:
   - For race/ethnicity: include Black, Hispanic, Other (omit White non-Hispanic).
   - For religion: include Conservative Protestant and No religion (omit the reference category used by Bryson).
5. **Report standardized coefficients only** (to mirror Table 2):
   - Either standardize variables before OLS, or compute β = b * (SDx/SDy).
6. **Align labels and ordering** to the paper’s table and remove any rows with NaN/0 created by dropped predictors.

If you paste your variable coding rules (especially religion, Hispanic, and the DV “dislike” definitions), I can point to the exact likely coding error for each of the sign/magnitude reversals (e.g., occupational prestige sign flip, constant mismatch).
