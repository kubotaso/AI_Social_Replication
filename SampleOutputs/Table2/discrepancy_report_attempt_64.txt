Score: 47/100
============================================================

## 1) Variable-name / coding mismatches (generated vs. Table 2)

### 1.1 Racism measure is not the same object
- **Generated name/definition:** “Racism score (0–5; strict 5 items, sum)”
- **True table name:** “Racism score”
- **Mismatch:** You’ve *re-defined* the racism scale (“strict 5 items, sum”). If Bryson’s “racism score” used a different item set, different handling of DK/NA, or a different scaling/standardization, coefficients won’t match.
- **Fix:** Recreate *exactly* the racism index used in Bryson (1996): same items, same response codings, same missing-data rules, same scale construction. Then compute standardized betas from that exact score.

### 1.2 Hispanic definition differs from the paper
- **Generated:** “Hispanic (best available from ETHNIC; unknown/missing treated as non-Hispanic)”
- **True:** “Hispanic”
- **Mismatch:** Treating unknown/missing as non-Hispanic is a substantive recode that will change coefficients and sample size.
- **Fix:** Code Hispanic exactly as the paper did (typically: Hispanic=1 if identified as Hispanic; otherwise 0; and **missing stays missing** or is excluded). Do **not** coerce missing to 0 unless the paper explicitly did.

### 1.3 “Other race” coding likely wrong
- **Generated:** “Other race (RACE==3)”
- **True:** “Other race”
- **Mismatch:** In many surveys RACE==3 might be “Other” *or* something else depending on the coding frame. Also, the paper’s “Other race” may have been “neither White nor Black nor Hispanic,” which is not the same as “RACE==3.”
- **Fix:** Build mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories exactly as in Bryson’s table. Commonly:
  - Black indicator
  - Hispanic indicator (ethnicity)
  - Other race indicator (remaining nonwhite/nonblack/nonhispanic)
  - with White non-Hispanic as the reference

### 1.4 Conservative Protestant proxy is not acceptable for replication
- **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy: Protestant & Baptist if DENOM available; else 0)”
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant”
- **Mismatch:** A proxy (and worse, defaulting to 0 when denomination unavailable) will distort the coefficient and N.
- **Fix:** Use the same religious-tradition classification Bryson used (likely RELTRAD-style or denomination-based grouping). If denomination isn’t available for some, they should be missing or classified using the same fallback rule as the original—not hard-coded to 0.

### 1.5 “No religion” coding may not match
- **Generated:** “No religion (RELIG==4)”
- **True:** “No religion”
- **Mismatch risk:** RELIG coding differs by dataset/year; RELIG==4 might not mean “none,” or the paper may have included atheists/agnostics differently.
- **Fix:** Verify RELIG coding for that survey year and implement the paper’s “no religion” definition.

### 1.6 Region (“Southern”) coding is over-engineered and may be wrong
- **Generated:** “Southern (derived from REGION; supports both 1..4 and 1..9 codings)”
- **True:** “Southern”
- **Mismatch:** If your REGION-to-South mapping doesn’t match Bryson’s, you’ll change effects and N.
- **Fix:** Apply the exact South definition from the paper (typically Census South). Don’t guess between alternative codings; confirm the coding scheme in the exact dataset extract used.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I list **Generated beta → True beta** and what’s wrong.

### Model 1 betas (DV = minority-linked genres, count of 6)
- **Racism:** 0.1328 → **0.130** (close; OK)
- **Education:** -0.1791 → **-0.175** (close; OK)
- **Income pc:** **+0.0092** → **-0.037** (WRONG sign and magnitude)
- **Occ prestige:** -0.0196 → **-0.020** (close; OK)
- **Female:** -0.0709 → **-0.057** (too negative)
- **Age:** 0.1520 → **0.163** (noticeably off)
- **Black:** **-0.1451 (**) → -0.132 (***)** (magnitude and significance mismatch)
- **Hispanic:** -0.0481 → **-0.058** (off)
- **Other race:** **+0.0231** → **-0.017** (WRONG sign)
- **Conservative Protestant:** 0.0778 → **0.063** (off)
- **No religion:** 0.0664 → **0.057** (off)
- **Southern:** 0.0277 → **0.024** (close)

### Model 2 betas (DV = remaining 12 genres)
- **Racism:** **-0.0022** → **0.080** (WRONG sign and magnitude; major replication failure)
- **Education:** -0.1928 → **-0.242** (substantially too small in magnitude)
- **Income pc:** -0.0345 → **-0.065** (too small)
- **Occ prestige:** -0.0150 → **0.005** (WRONG sign)
- **Female:** -0.0698 → **-0.070** (matches)
- **Age:** 0.1120 (*) → **0.126 (**) ** (too small; significance mismatch)
- **Black:** 0.0617 → **0.042** (off)
- **Hispanic:** -0.0780 → **-0.029** (way too negative)
- **Other race:** 0.0898 (*) → **0.047** (too large; significance mismatch)
- **Conservative Protestant:** 0.0961 (*) → **0.048** (too large; significance mismatch)
- **No religion:** 0.0168 → **0.024** (off)
- **Southern:** 0.0767 → **0.069** (close)

**Interpretation mismatch implicit in coefficients:** In the true table, racism is *positive* in both models (0.130**, 0.080). Your generated Model 2 implies racism has ~zero/negative association, contradicting the paper’s substantive finding.

## 3) Fit statistics / constants / N mismatches

### Model 1
- **N:** Generated **549** vs True **644** (WRONG)
- **R²:** 0.1351 vs **0.145** (WRONG)
- **Adj R²:** 0.1157 vs **0.129** (WRONG)
- **Constant:** 2.5217 vs **2.415** (WRONG; though both significant)

### Model 2
- **N:** Generated **507** vs True **605** (WRONG)
- **R²:** 0.1258 vs **0.147** (WRONG)
- **Adj R²:** 0.1045 vs **0.130** (WRONG)
- **Constant:** **5.1256** vs **7.860** (very wrong)

**Key point:** These gaps are far too large to be rounding error; they indicate you are not using the same analytic sample and/or not constructing the DV(s) the same way.

---

## 4) Standard errors: a reporting mismatch
- **Generated output:** You show **no SEs** (good), but your instruction asks to check SEs.
- **True table:** **does not report SEs**.
- **Mismatch to fix:** If your generated report ever included SEs/t-stats/p-values “as in the table,” that would be wrong. Here, the problem is instead that your **significance stars** are inconsistent with the table even though both are based on p-values.
- **Fix:** Replicate p-values from the same model/specification/sample; then apply the same star cutoffs. If you can’t replicate the sample/model exactly, you should *not* claim star agreement with Table 2.

---

## 5) What is causing the mismatches (most likely)

### 5.1 Wrong DV construction (biggest red flag)
Your constants and N are dramatically off, especially Model 2’s constant (5.13 vs 7.86). That usually happens when:
- you used a different dislike coding threshold,
- you used different sets of genres in each DV,
- you treated missing genre ratings differently (e.g., counting missing as “not disliked” or dropping cases with any missing).

**Fix (DV):** Reconstruct both DVs exactly as Bryson did:
- same list of 6 “minority-linked” genres,
- same list of the remaining 12,
- same rule for what counts as “dislike,”
- same missing-data handling (likely: respondent must have valid ratings on the relevant genre set; otherwise DV missing).

### 5.2 Wrong sample restrictions / listwise deletion rules
Your N is lower by ~95 (M1) and ~98 (M2). That’s consistent with:
- stricter listwise deletion due to your “strict 5 items” racism score,
- proxy religion variable inducing extra missing or misclassification,
- treating missing Hispanic as non-Hispanic (changes N patterns but also bias),
- dropping on income/occupational prestige if you didn’t use the same imputation/handling.

**Fix (sample):**
- Apply the paper’s inclusion criteria and missing-data rules.
- Ensure the regression uses the same missingness approach as the original (typically listwise deletion on variables in the model, but using the original constructed variables).

### 5.3 Wrong coding of key predictors (income, race/ethnicity, religion)
The sign flip for **income in Model 1** and **occupational prestige in Model 2** is classic “coding mismatch”:
- income per capita might need log transform, top-coding adjustment, or scaling,
- prestige might be reversed or standardized differently,
- race/ethnicity categories might not match the reference group.

**Fix (predictors):**
- Confirm transformations (e.g., income per capita raw vs logged).
- Standardize predictors *after* transformations and *within the analytic sample* used for that model if you’re reproducing standardized betas.
- Recreate categorical indicators with the same reference group.

### 5.4 Standardization mismatch (how “standardized beta” was computed)
Even if unstandardized coefficients match, standardized betas differ if you:
- standardize using the full sample instead of the model sample,
- standardize before vs after listwise deletion,
- standardize including weights vs not.

**Fix (standardization):**
- Use the same sample as the regression to compute SDs.
- If the original used weights, apply them consistently (both in regression and in computing SDs for standardization).

### 5.5 Survey weights/design effects likely ignored
Bryson (1996) used GSS-type data; weighting can shift coefficients and significance.
- **Fix:** Check the paper’s methods for weighting. If weights were used, run weighted OLS and compute standardized betas accordingly.

## 6) Concrete “to-do” checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Rebuild both DVs** using Bryson’s exact genre lists, dislike definition, and missing-data rule.
2. **Recreate “racism score”** exactly (items, coding, missing handling). Do not use “strict 5 items” unless that is explicitly what Bryson used.
3. **Recode Hispanic** without forcing unknown/missing to 0; match the paper’s ethnicity/race scheme.
4. **Recode “Other race”** to match Bryson’s mutually exclusive categories (and correct reference group).
5. **Rebuild Conservative Protestant** using the same classification scheme as the paper (no proxy default-to-0).
6. **Match model sample sizes (N=644 and N=605)** by applying the same inclusion/exclusion rules.
7. **Use the same estimation details**: weights (if any), OLS, and then compute **standardized betas** from that exact specification.
8. **Only then** compute R²/Adj R² and constants; they should move toward **0.145/0.129 and 2.415** (Model 1) and **0.147/0.130 and 7.860** (Model 2).

If you share the exact code you used to construct (a) the two DVs and (b) racism score / religion / race-ethnicity indicators, I can point line-by-line to where each mismatch is introduced.
