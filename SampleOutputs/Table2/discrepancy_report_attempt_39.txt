============================================================

### 1) Global/documentation mismatches (what the table is supposed to be)

**Mismatch A: Sample sizes (N) are completely different**
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=261; Model 2 N=259  
- **True (Bryson 1996 Table 2):** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605
- **Fix:** You are not reproducing Bryson’s analytic sample. To match Table 2 you must:
  1. Use the same source dataset/year and the same inclusion rules (Bryson uses GSS-based measures; your extract is much smaller).
  2. Apply the paper’s listwise-deletion rules on the same variables *after* constructing the DVs/IVs exactly as Bryson did.
  3. Verify weighted vs unweighted estimation (GSS often uses weights; if Bryson weighted, you must as well).

**Mismatch B: R² / Adjusted R² do not match**
- **Generated:** Model1 R²=0.178, Adj R²=0.142; Model2 R²=0.151, Adj R²=0.114  
- **True:** Model1 R²=0.145, Adj R²=0.129; Model2 R²=0.147, Adj R²=0.130
- **Fix:** Once the sample and variable construction match, refit OLS and compute R²/Adj R² the same way (and with the same weights if applicable). Current R² differences are consistent with using a different sample and at least some different codings.

**Mismatch C: Constant/intercept values are wrong**
- **Generated:** Model1 Constant=2.5927; Model2 Constant=5.1853  
- **True:** Model1 Constant=2.415***; Model2 Constant=7.860 (no stars shown in your transcription)
- **Fix:** Intercepts will only align if:
  - the DV scaling matches exactly (counts vs means, range, handling of missing, etc.)
  - the IVs are coded the same (esp. dummies and reference categories)
  - the sample matches

**Mismatch D: “No religion” is dropped for no variation, but in the true model it varies and is included**
- **Generated:** “No religion” = NaN and flagged “dropped (no variation)” in both models.
- **True:** No religion is included with coefficients (Model1=0.057; Model2=0.024).
- **Fix:** Your analytic sample has `no_religion` all zeros (or otherwise constant). That means you constructed it incorrectly (or filtered the sample in a way that eliminates nonreligious respondents).
  - Rebuild `no_religion` from the original religion variable using Bryson’s definition.
  - Ensure you didn’t accidentally subset to only religious respondents (e.g., by dropping missing denomination in a way that removes “none”).
  - After building dummies, always check `value_counts()` to confirm variation before regression.

**Mismatch E: Table 2 reports standardized coefficients only; your output adds significance stars but is inconsistent with Bryson’s stars**
- Bryson’s table has its own stars. Your stars come from your regression on a different sample and thus won’t match.
- **Fix:** Once you replicate the exact model/sample, compute p-values from the OLS output and then assign stars using Bryson’s thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001, two-tailed). Until then, don’t claim they match Table 2.

**Mismatch F: Standard errors**
- User requested checking SEs, but:
  - **True table:** *no standard errors reported.*
  - **Generated:** *no standard errors reported either.*
- **Fix:** You can’t “match standard errors” to Table 2 because they are not published there. If you want SEs, you must compute them from the replicated regression (and decide classic vs robust vs design-based/weighted SEs). But you cannot validate them against the printed table.

### 2) Variable-name mismatches (and meaning/measurement mismatches)

**Mismatch G: “Conservative Protestant (proxy)” vs “Conservative Protestant”**
- **Generated label:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy)”
- **True label:** “Conservative Protestant”
- **Fix:** This is not just naming—calling it a “proxy” signals it likely isn’t the same operationalization. Bryson’s measure is a specific religious tradition classification.  
  - Recode Conservative Protestant using the same denominational coding scheme Bryson used (typically based on detailed denomination categories), not a simplified indicator.

**Mismatch H: Age variable label**
- **Generated:** `age_years` shown in sample; output label “Age”
- **True:** “Age”
- This is mostly cosmetic *if* it’s truly years and coded the same.
- **Fix:** confirm same age restrictions (e.g., adults only), same handling of top-coding, missing.

**Mismatch I: Race dummies likely not the same baseline/reference**
- Output uses Black/Hispanic/Other race dummies; baseline presumably White non-Hispanic.
- Bryson’s coding likely uses White as reference too, but your “Other race” coefficient differences strongly suggest coding differences and/or sample differences.
- **Fix:** Ensure:
  - `black=1` only for non-Hispanic Black (unless Bryson defines differently)
  - `hispanic=1` regardless of race (common in GSS coding) if that’s what Bryson did
  - “Other race” matches Bryson’s residual category
  - reference category matches (White, non-Hispanic)

### 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 1)

Model 1 true coefficients vs generated:

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.140* | 0.130** | value off; stars differ |
| Education | -0.260*** | -0.175*** | **too negative** |
| Household income per capita | -0.012 | -0.037 | too close to 0 |
| Occupational prestige | 0.058 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.034 | -0.057 | magnitude off |
| Age | 0.175** | 0.163*** | magnitude slightly off; stars differ |
| Black | -0.177* | -0.132*** | too negative; stars differ a lot |
| Hispanic | -0.007 | -0.058 | much closer to 0 |
| Other race | -0.005 | -0.017 | smaller magnitude |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.120 | 0.063 | about ~2× too large |
| No religion | dropped | 0.057 | **omitted incorrectly** |
| Southern | -0.059 | 0.024 | **wrong sign** |
| Constant | 2.593*** | 2.415*** | too high |
| R² | 0.178 | 0.145 | too high |
| Adj R² | 0.142 | 0.129 | too high |
| N | 261 | 644 | wrong sample |

**Interpretation mismatches implied by these signs**
- In Bryson, **Southern is positive (0.024)**: Southerners dislike the minority-liked genres *slightly more*, net of controls (and it’s small/non-sig). Your generated model makes it negative, implying the opposite substantive pattern.
- In Bryson, **Occupational prestige is slightly negative (-0.020)**; yours is positive, reversing the class-gradient interpretation.

**Fix for Model 1 coefficients**
- Rebuild DV1 exactly as Bryson: *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music* (likely an index/sum/mean of “dislike” indicators). Your DV is `dv1_minority6_dislikes` with values like 0–6, which sounds like a **count** of “dislikes.” Bryson’s DV may be scaled differently (sum of ratings, mean dislike, etc.). Even if it is a count, you must ensure the *exact* “dislike” threshold/coding matches.
- Ensure IV construction and sample match, especially religion and region.

### 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 2)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.013 | 0.080 | **wrong sign and far off** |
| Education | -0.165* | -0.242*** | too small in magnitude; stars differ |
| Household income per capita | -0.077 | -0.065 | close-ish |
| Occupational prestige | -0.079 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.082 | -0.070 | close-ish |
| Age | 0.127* | 0.126** | value close; stars differ |
| Black | 0.039 | 0.042 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.023 | -0.029 | close-ish |
| Other race | 0.122* | 0.047 | too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.142* | 0.048 | much too large |
| No religion | dropped | 0.024 | **omitted incorrectly** |
| Southern | 0.104 | 0.069 | too large |
| Constant | 5.185*** | 7.860 | far off |
| R² | 0.151 | 0.147 | close-ish but not matching |
| Adj R² | 0.114 | 0.130 | too low |
| N | 259 | 605 | wrong sample |

**Biggest substantive/interpretation error**
- Bryson Model 2 has **racism score = +0.080** (non-sig in the printed table), while your model has **-0.013**. That flips the direction: Bryson suggests more racism is associated with *more* dislike of the remaining genres (weakly), while yours suggests essentially no relationship/slightly negative.
- **Fix:** This almost certainly comes from either:
  1. DV2 constructed differently than Bryson’s “12 remaining genres” index; and/or
  2. racism scale coded reversed (higher=less racist in your data); and/or
  3. very different sample selection.
  
Check your racism coding: if higher values mean *less* racism, you must reverse it to match Bryson (e.g., `racism_bryson = max - racism_score` after confirming the intended direction).

### 5) What to change in the pipeline so the generated analysis can match Table 2

1. **Use the correct dataset and replicate Bryson’s inclusion rules**
   - Your N is ~40% of what it should be. Identify where cases are being lost (missingness, filters, merging, restricting to certain respondents).
   - Produce a replication flow table: starting N → after DV construction → after each IV → final N.

2. **Reconstruct both dependent variables exactly**
   - Confirm whether Bryson uses:
     - a mean “dislike” rating across genres,
     - a count of genres disliked,
     - or standardized/weighted index.
   - Your DV names (`dv1_minority6_dislikes`, `dv2_remaining12_dislikes`) look like **counts**. If Bryson used averaged ratings, your coefficients and intercepts will not match.

3. **Recode religion variables correctly**
   - Build **two separate dummies**: Conservative Protestant and No religion, matching Bryson’s definitions.
   - Verify both vary in the analytic sample (not all zeros).
   - Don’t label it “proxy” if it’s supposed to be the same measure.

4. **Verify region coding**
   - Bryson’s “Southern” is positive in both models; your Model 1 is negative.
   - Ensure South is coded using Census region and that missing region isn’t being miscoded as 0.

5. **Standardization procedure**
   - Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. Ensure you standardize *the same way*:
     - either run OLS on z-scored DV and IVs (except dummies sometimes left unstandardized in some workflows), **or**
     - compute standardized betas from unstandardized OLS using SD ratios.
   - To match Bryson, you must follow what he did. If unknown, the safest is: compute standardized betas consistently for *all* predictors including dummies (as most packages will when you z-score everything). But confirm because dummy standardization affects magnitudes.

6. **Stars/significance**
   - After you replicate coefficients, compute p-values and apply Bryson’s cutoffs. Until then, treat stars as non-comparable.

---

### 6) One more internal inconsistency in the generated output
- The fit table says **Dropped_no_variation = no_religion**, but the coefficient tables still list “No religion” with NaN. That’s fine mechanically, but **substantively it should not be dropped** if you’re reproducing Table 2.
- Fix is the same: rebuild `no_religion` and fix sample restrictions.

---

If you share (a) the code used to build `dv1_minority6_dislikes` and `dv2_remaining12_dislikes`, (b) how `racism_score` is coded (direction and range), and (c) how religion is coded into `cons_prot` and `no_religion`, I can point to the exact step(s) causing the sign flips (especially racism in Model 2 and South/occupational prestige in Model 1).
