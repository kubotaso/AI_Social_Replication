Score: 35/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / coding mismatches (and what they do to coefficients)

1) **Racism score name & scale**
- **Generated:** “Racism score (0–5)” / `racism_score` (looks like fractional values appear: e.g., 3.75, 1.25 in the analytic sample).
- **True:** “Racism score” (Bryson table; scale not shown there, but the published coefficient assumes the paper’s construction).
- **Mismatch:** Your generated racism variable is not the same measure (it is not purely 0–5 integers; it likely averages items and creates decimals, or it was rescaled).
- **Fix:** Reconstruct *exactly* Bryson’s racism scale from the same items and coding rules (including any reverse-coding and missing-data rule), and **do not re-standardize differently than the paper**. Verify its distribution (min/max and whether values are discrete) matches expectations from the original codebook/paper.

2) **Education**
- **Generated label:** “Education (years)” / `education`.
- **True label:** “Education”.
- **Potential mismatch:** In GSS, education is often **highest year completed** (EDUC) but sometimes converted or top-coded. Your coefficient differences suggest the same *concept* but possibly different handling (top-coding, missing, standardization).
- **Fix:** Use the same source variable and coding Bryson used (likely GSS EDUC) and the same missing-value handling and standardization.

3) **Household income per capita**
- **Generated:** “Household income per capita (REALINC/HOMPOP)” / `income_pc`.
- **True:** “Household income per capita”.
- **Mismatch risk:** Bryson may have used a *specific* income variable (possibly REALINC) with a particular equivalence scale and trimming; your `REALINC/HOMPOP` choice may not match.
- **Fix:** Confirm the paper’s exact computation (e.g., REALINC divided by household size, or a different income measure; how zero/negative incomes handled; inflation adjustment year). Replicate *exact* denominator and missing rules.

4) **Occupational prestige**
- **Generated:** PRESTG80 (`occ_prestige`).
- **True:** “Occupational prestige”.
- **Mismatch:** Bryson might have used a different prestige score variable/year or treated missing differently (occupation missing is common).
- **Fix:** Use the prestige measure specified in the paper (PRESTG80 vs PRESTGxx) and apply identical sample restrictions (e.g., include non-workers with missing prestige? impute? set to 0? drop?).

5) **Race/ethnicity dummies**
- **Generated labels/coding:**
  - “Black (RACE==2)”
  - “Other race (RACE==3)”
  - “Hispanic (constructed from ETHNIC; extract-limited)”
- **True:** Black, Hispanic, Other race (as in table).
- **Mismatch:** Your Hispanic construction is explicitly “extract-limited,” i.e., not confidently matching Bryson’s. Also your “Other race (RACE==3)” may not align with Bryson’s “Other” category (which may include more than one code, depending on the year’s race coding).
- **Fix:** Replicate Bryson’s exact race/ethnicity definitions for 1993 GSS (which variables, which codes included). Ensure:
  - White is the omitted reference.
  - “Other race” includes exactly the same set of respondents as in Bryson’s code.

6) **Religion variables**
- **Generated:** 
  - “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”
  - “No religion (RELIG==4)” but **dropped (no variation)**
- **True:** Conservative Protestant, No religion (both included; both have coefficients in both models).
- **Mismatch (major):** You did not reproduce Bryson’s religion coding and, critically, your analytic sample has **no variation** on “no religion,” which means your sample selection/coding is wrong (you effectively restricted to only religious respondents or mis-coded RELIG).
- **Fix:**
  - Rebuild “Conservative Protestant” using Bryson’s classification (usually a denominational typology, not the simplistic RELIG/DENOM conjunction).
  - Ensure “No religion” is coded correctly and that your sample includes non-religious respondents.
  - Re-check filters that may have inadvertently removed RELIG==none (e.g., dropping DENOM missing could drop “no religion” disproportionately).

7) **Region**
- **Generated:** “Southern (REGION==3)”
- **True:** “Southern”
- **Mismatch likely:** REGION coding differs by survey year; also “South” is often REGION==5 depending on coding scheme. If you used the wrong numeric code, you created the wrong dummy.
- **Fix:** Verify the 1993 GSS REGION codes and set South accordingly. Confirm with frequencies that “southern” share is plausible.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I list **Generated vs True** and the mismatch direction.

#### Model 1 (paper’s “Model 1”; your “Model A”)
- Racism: **0.1649** vs **0.130** → too large (+0.035)
- Education: **-0.2802** vs **-0.175** → much more negative (-0.105)
- Income pc: **-0.0315** vs **-0.037** → close (+0.006)
- Occ prestige: **0.0767** vs **-0.020** → wrong sign and magnitude
- Female: **-0.0216** vs **-0.057** → too small in magnitude
- Age: **0.1676** vs **0.163** → very close
- Black: **-0.1370** vs **-0.132** → close
- Hispanic: **-0.0580** vs **-0.058** → matches (very close)
- Other race: **0.0087** vs **-0.017** → wrong sign
- Cons Protestant: **0.0627** vs **0.063** → matches (very close)
- No religion: **dropped** vs **0.057** → missing entirely
- Southern: **-0.0358** vs **0.024** → wrong sign

#### Model 2 (paper’s “Model 2”; your “Model B”)
- Racism: **0.0363** vs **0.080** → too small
- Education: **-0.2331** vs **-0.242** → close
- Income pc: **-0.0530** vs **-0.065** → too small magnitude
- Occ prestige: **-0.0107** vs **0.005** → sign mismatch (small)
- Female: **-0.0677** vs **-0.070** → matches (close)
- Age: **0.0751** vs **0.126** → too small
- Black: **0.0797** vs **0.042** → too large
- Hispanic: **-0.0436** vs **-0.029** → too negative
- Other race: **0.1002** vs **0.047** → too large
- Cons Protestant: **0.1275** vs **0.048** → far too large (and you mark it significant; paper does not)
- No religion: **dropped** vs **0.024** → missing entirely
- Southern: **0.1012** vs **0.069** → too large

**What these patterns imply:** you are not just suffering from random noise; multiple variables flip sign (prestige, southern, other race), and religion is incorrectly defined/filtered. That strongly indicates **coding/specification differences** and **sample definition differences**, not minor rounding.

---

### 3) “Standard errors” mismatches
- **True table:** explicitly **does not report standard errors**.
- **Generated output:** does not actually display SEs either, but your instruction asks to compare SEs.
- **Mismatch:** You can’t “match” SEs because the benchmark table contains none.
- **Fix:** If you want an apples-to-apples replication, **omit SEs/t-stats** in the generated table and report only standardized betas + significance stars. If you still compute SEs internally, don’t present them as something the paper reported.

---

### 4) Fit statistics and constants: major mismatches

#### Sample size (N)
- **Model A:** Generated **N=309** vs True **N=644**
- **Model B:** Generated **N=305** vs True **N=605**
- **Problem:** Your analytic sample is about half of Bryson’s. This alone will change coefficients, significance, and “no variation” problems.
- **Fix:** Reproduce the paper’s **case-selection rules**:
  - Use the same year (1993) and same subsample (likely adults with valid music-genre ratings + valid covariates).
  - Avoid dropping large numbers due to constructed variables (e.g., DENOM missing, prestige missing, income missing). Bryson likely retained more cases by different missing handling or by using variables with fewer missings.
  - Confirm each variable’s missing count and ensure you aren’t doing listwise deletion in a way Bryson didn’t.

#### R² and adjusted R²
- **Model A:** Generated R² **0.192** vs True **0.145**
- **Model B:** Generated R² **0.154** vs True **0.147** (close-ish)
- **Fix:** Once N and variable coding match, R² should move toward the published values. Right now Model A is overfitting relative to paper—consistent with a different sample and/or different DV construction.

#### Constants
- **Model A constant:** Generated **2.636*** vs True **2.415*** (difference ~0.22)
- **Model B constant:** Generated **5.542*** vs True **7.860** (very large difference ~-2.32)
- **Interpretation issue:** Your “Model B” constant being far lower suggests your DV is constructed on a different scale/mean or you’re using a different base set of genre dislikes.
- **Fix:** Rebuild the DVs exactly (see next section). If you standardize predictors but DV is a count, the intercept should match the expected mean at reference levels; a big mismatch flags DV and/or sample mismatch.

---

### 5) Dependent variable construction mismatches (and downstream interpretation errors)

- **True DVs:**
  1) Count of dislikes for six “minority-linked genres”
  2) Count of dislikes for the other 12 genres
- **Generated DVs:** look like counts too, but your *overall descriptive means* differ:
  - DV1 all 1993 mean **2.057**
  - DV2 all 1993 mean **3.779**
  These might be plausible, but the **Model B constant discrepancy** suggests your DV2 is not the same (different genre list, different dislike threshold, or missing handling).
- **Fix checklist:**
  - Confirm the **exact 18 genres** used in 1993 and which are in the “6” vs “12” sets per Bryson.
  - Confirm “dislike” definition: is it “dislike” category only, or “dislike/strongly dislike,” etc. Small threshold differences change totals and intercepts.
  - Handle “don’t know,” “not asked,” “never heard,” or “missing” exactly as Bryson did (often recoded to neutral or treated as missing; either choice changes N massively).

---

### 6) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation)

Because your coefficients and N differ, your stars diverge from the paper:

- **Model 1 racism:** Generated ** (p<.01) matches ** in paper, but coefficient is too big.
- **Model 1 age:** Generated ** vs paper *** (you understate significance).
- **Model 1 black:** Generated * vs paper *** (you severely understate).
- **Model 2 conservative Protestant:** Generated * vs paper shows no star (and coefficient is much larger in yours).

**Fix:** Once the **exact sample (N≈644/605)** and **exact predictors** are used, compute p-values from OLS and apply the paper’s thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001, two-tailed). Right now the star mismatch is an expected consequence of the wrong replication setup.

## How to fix the generated analysis so it matches Bryson (1996) Table 2

### Step-by-step replication plan

1) **Match the analytic samples (N) first**
- Target: **N=644** for Model 1, **N=605** for Model 2.
- Produce a missingness table for every variable entering each model (DV + all IVs).
- Identify which variable(s) are causing the extra ~300+ case loss (very likely: DENOM/RELIG coding, prestige, income, Hispanic construction).
- Adjust missing-data handling to mirror Bryson (e.g., use variables with less missingness; don’t condition on DENOM for “no religion”; ensure race/ethnicity measures exist for all).

2) **Recreate religion variables correctly**
- Implement a denominational typology for “Conservative Protestant” rather than your proxy.
- Ensure “No religion” includes respondents with no religious preference and that they are not dropped due to DENOM missingness.
- This should also remove the “dropped (no variation)” error.

3) **Fix ‘Southern’ coding**
- Verify REGION codes for 1993; recode South correctly.
- Re-run to check that Southern coefficient sign aligns (paper: +0.024 in Model 1; +0.069 in Model 2).

4) **Fix race/ethnicity coding**
- Reconstruct Hispanic and Other race to match Bryson’s definitions for that year.
- Ensure “Other race” is not just a single code if the year has multiple nonwhite nonblack categories.

5) **Rebuild DVs from the exact genre items and dislike threshold**
- Confirm which six genres are in the “minority-linked” set and how “dislike” is defined.
- Confirm treatment of “never heard”/missing responses.
- This is crucial for matching the **Model 2 intercept** (your biggest constant error).

6) **Compute standardized coefficients the same way**
- Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas). Ensure:
  - DV is not standardized (it doesn’t have to be for beta reporting, but your standardization routine must match).
  - Betas are computed as \( \beta = b \cdot \frac{\sigma_x}{\sigma_y} \) using the **analytic sample’s** SDs.
- Do not standardize using the full-sample SDs if Bryson used model-specific analytic samples.

7) **Only report what the paper reports**
- Drop SEs from the replication table (paper has none).
- Keep: standardized betas, stars, constant, R², adjusted R², N.

### Quick “most diagnostic” mismatches (highest priority)
1) **N is wrong by ~50%** → everything else will drift.
2) **No religion dropped (no variation)** → indicates incorrect sample restriction/coding.
3) **Southern and prestige flip sign in Model 1** → strongly indicates wrong coding (REGION codes) and/or wrong prestige variable/sample.
4) **Model 2 constant wildly off** → DV construction mismatch (genre list/threshold/missing).

If you share (a) the exact code used to build the two DVs and (b) the exact sample filtering/listwise deletion logic, I can pinpoint which specific line(s) are producing the N collapse and the “no religion” no-variation artifact.
