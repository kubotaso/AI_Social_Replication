Score: 38/100
============================================================

### 0) Core problem: you’re not comparing like with like
The “true” Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients only** (with stars), **no standard errors**, and it uses **N≈600**. Your generated output mixes (a) “paper_style” standardized-looking betas, (b) a “full” table that clearly includes **SE/t/p** (so it’s coming from an actual regression run), and (c) **different samples** (N=327 and N=308). Because of that, almost every difference downstream (coefficients, stars, intercepts, R²) is expected.

**Fix required before anything else:**
1) Recreate Bryson’s **exact analytic sample** (GSS 1993 only; listwise deletion rules matching the paper; same coding).
2) Report the same estimand as the paper: **standardized OLS coefficients** (and stars). Do **not** invent SEs for “true results” because the PDF doesn’t provide them.

## 1) Sample size / model fit mismatches (major)
### Mismatch
- **True Model 1:** N=644, R²=.145, adj R²=.129  
  **Generated ModelA_fit:** N=327, R²=0.1896, adj R²=0.1639
- **True Model 2:** N=605, R²=.147, adj R²=.130  
  **Generated ModelB_fit:** N=308, R²=0.1658, adj R²=0.1377

### How to fix
- You are using roughly **half the intended sample**, which will change coefficients and significance.
- Ensure:
  - **Filter to GSS 1993**
  - Construct both dependent variables exactly as in Bryson
  - Apply the same missing-data handling (likely **listwise deletion** on the variables in each model)
  - Use the same weights if the paper does (Bryson often uses GSS weights; confirm in methods/appendix)

Until N matches (~644 / ~605), don’t expect coefficients or stars to align.

---

## 2) Variable-name alignment: your tables are unlabeled and appear out-of-order
### Mismatch
Your generated coefficient rows have **no variable names**, so it’s impossible to verify one-to-one correspondence. Also you show **dropped_zero_variance** for *hispanic* and *no_religion*, which contradicts the true table (those coefficients exist and vary).

### How to fix
- Output regression tables **with explicit row names** in the exact order used in the paper:
  1. Racism score
  2. Education
  3. Household income per capita
  4. Occupational prestige
  5. Female
  6. Age
  7. Black
  8. Hispanic
  9. Other race
  10. Conservative Protestant
  11. No religion
  12. Southern
  13. Constant
- Verify dummy coding creates variation:
  - If `hispanic` is all zeros, you likely filtered to a subsample with no Hispanics (wrong year, wrong subset, or erroneous merge).
  - If `no_religion` is all zeros, your religion recode is wrong (e.g., you collapsed “none” into missing or into another category).

**Concrete check:** print `value_counts()` for each dummy in the final analytic dataset used in each model.

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (Model 1 / “ModelA_paper_style” vs true Model 1)
I’ll assume your “ModelA_paper_style” rows correspond in order to the paper’s variables (they’re 13 rows incl. constant; with two NaNs for dropped predictors). Under that assumption:

### Model 1: true vs generated (beta)
- Racism: **true 0.130** vs **gen 0.1395** (close; acceptable once sample fixed)
- Education: **true -0.175** vs **gen -0.2609** (**too negative**)
- Income: **true -0.037** vs **gen -0.03445** (close)
- Occ prestige: **true -0.020** vs **gen 0.03034** (**sign flips**)
- Female: **true -0.057** vs **gen -0.02580** (magnitude off)
- Age: **true 0.163** vs **gen 0.19118** (somewhat high)
- Black: **true -0.132** vs **gen -0.12720** (close)
- Hispanic: **true -0.058** vs **gen dropped_zero_variance** (**not acceptable**)
- Other race: **true -0.017** vs **gen 0.00366** (wrong sign / near zero)
- Conservative Protestant: **true 0.063** vs **gen 0.07914** (close)
- No religion: **true 0.057** vs **gen dropped_zero_variance** (**not acceptable**)
- Southern: **true 0.024** vs **gen 0.02195** (close)
- Constant: **true 2.415** vs **gen 2.65363** (off; could be due to sample/coding)

### How to fix Model 1 coefficient mismatches
1) **Fix the sample (N=644)** first; many coefficient differences (Education, Age, constant) likely shrink toward the published values.
2) **Fix occupational prestige & income scaling**:
   - If you used a different prestige measure or reversed scale, you can get sign changes.
   - “Household income per capita” must be constructed the same way (household income divided by household size; and likely logged or not—match the paper).
3) **Fix dummy codings**:
   - Race categories must be mutually exclusive with the same reference group (usually White, non-Hispanic).
   - Religion: “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” must be coded exactly as Bryson (and not overlapping). If you accidentally made “no religion” a subset of “not conservative protestant” rather than a distinct dummy, you can get zero variance or collinearity artifacts.

---

## 4) Coefficient mismatches (Model 2 / “ModelB_paper_style” vs true Model 2)
Again assuming row order matches:

### Model 2: true vs generated (beta)
- Racism: **true 0.080** vs **gen -0.00508** (**wrong sign and near zero**)
- Education: **true -0.242** vs **gen -0.22376** (close)
- Income: **true -0.065** vs **gen -0.09537** (too negative)
- Occ prestige: **true 0.005** vs **gen -0.01234** (sign flip, small)
- Female: **true -0.070** vs **gen -0.09121** (somewhat more negative)
- Age: **true 0.126** vs **gen 0.09138** (too low)
- Black: **true 0.042** vs **gen 0.11223** (too high)
- Hispanic: **true -0.029** vs **gen dropped_zero_variance** (**not acceptable**)
- Other race: **true 0.047** vs **gen 0.13205** (**too high**)
- Conservative Protestant: **true 0.048** vs **gen 0.08033** (high-ish)
- No religion: **true 0.024** vs **gen dropped_zero_variance** (**not acceptable**)
- Southern: **true 0.069** vs **gen 0.14242** (**too high**)
- Constant: **true 7.860** vs **gen 5.67374** (far off)

### How to fix Model 2 mismatches
- The racism coefficient flipping from **+0.080** to ~0 strongly suggests at least one of:
  1) **Racism scale constructed differently** (items reversed, different item set, different standardization)
  2) **DV “12 remaining genres” constructed differently** (wrong genre list, wrong disliked threshold, wrong range)
  3) **Sample restriction error** (year/weights/subpopulation)
- Rebuild DV2 from scratch from the GSS music items, matching:
  - Which genres count in DV1 vs DV2
  - How “dislike” is defined (e.g., “strongly dislike” only vs “dislike + strongly dislike”)
  - How missing responses are handled

---

## 5) Standard errors / “full” output vs the paper (conceptual mismatch)
### Mismatch
- Your **ModelA_full / ModelB_full** provide SE/t/p-values.
- The **true Table 2 has no SEs**, so you cannot claim agreement/disagreement on SEs with the paper’s Table 2.

### How to fix
- If your goal is to reproduce Table 2: **do not compare SEs at all**.
- If you want SEs anyway, label them as **your computed SEs** from your replication dataset, not “true from the paper.”
- Also: decide whether to use **robust SEs**; the paper’s stars are based on p-values from their approach (likely conventional OLS SEs unless stated otherwise).

---

## 6) Stars/significance mismatches (partly driven by N and by your star logic)
Examples:
- True Model 1 racism is **0.130\*\***; your generated shows **0.139\*** (one star).
- True Model 1 Black is **-0.132\*\*\***; your generated shows **-0.127\*** (one star).
- True Model 2 Age is **0.126\*\***; your generated shows **0.091** (no stars).
- True Model 2 Constant has no stars in paper excerpt (often constants not starred or not tested the same way); your generated constant has no stars but is also a different value.

### How to fix
1) Stars depend on **p-values**, which depend on N, variance, and SE assumptions. Get the **same N and coding** first.
2) Confirm the star thresholds match exactly: *p*<.05, <.01, <.001 (you appear to use that, but your results’ p-values must be computed on the same basis).
3) Ensure you are starring the **standardized coefficient tests** consistently (typically you test the unstandardized coefficient; the standardized shares the same p-value, but only if computed from the same model and transformation).

---

## 7) Dropped predictors due to “zero variance” (definite error)
### Mismatch
Generated says: `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: hispanic, no_religion` in **both** models.
But the true table reports nonzero coefficients for both in both models.

### How to fix (most likely causes)
- You accidentally:
  - filtered out Hispanics (e.g., only non-Hispanic sample),
  - or recoded Hispanic to 0/NA incorrectly,
  - or subsetted to a region/year where those categories disappear (but in GSS 1993 they should exist),
  - or created “no_religion” incorrectly (e.g., treating “none” as missing).
- Minimum diagnostic:
  - In the final model frame: confirm `hispanic.mean()>0` and `<1`, same for `no_religion`.
  - Confirm you did not include a full set of religion dummies **plus** an intercept creating perfect collinearity; but note: collinearity usually drops one category, not “zero variance.” Zero variance is literally all same value.

---

## 8) Intercept mismatch (and interpretation issue)
### Mismatch
- True constants: 2.415 (Model1) and 7.860 (Model2)
- Generated: 2.654 and 5.674

### How to fix
- Intercepts are sensitive to:
  - sample composition,
  - whether predictors are centered/standardized before fitting,
  - DV construction (range/count),
  - inclusion/exclusion of categories.
- To match the paper:
  - Fit the **unstandardized OLS** on original scales, then compute standardized betas separately (or via standardized variables but then interpret intercept appropriately).
  - Ensure DV is the **count of genres disliked** with the same possible range as Bryson’s.

---

## 9) Interpretation mismatches to avoid
### Mismatch
Your generated output invites interpreting “paper_style beta” alongside “unstandardized_intercept” and SEs, which conflates standardized and unstandardized quantities.

### How to fix
- Present Table 2-style output as:
  - standardized coefficients + stars,
  - N, R², adjusted R²,
  - and **do not** label the constant as “unstandardized_intercept” next to standardized betas unless you clearly explain it (the paper just reports “Constant”).
- If you must include SEs, add a separate table and explicitly state: “SEs are from our replication; Bryson (1996) Table 2 does not report SEs.”

---

# Minimal checklist to make your generated analysis match the paper
1) Match **data**: GSS 1993, same exclusions, same weights.
2) Match **DVs**: correct genre sets for DV1 (6 genres) and DV2 (the other 12), correct dislike coding, correct handling of missing genre items.
3) Match **predictor construction**:
   - racism score scale and direction,
   - education, income per capita, prestige definitions,
   - race and religion dummy definitions and reference categories,
   - southern definition.
4) Fit **OLS**, then compute **standardized betas**, and apply star cutoffs.
5) Ensure final Ns are **644 and 605** and R² near **.145/.147**.

If you paste the code (or at least the exact variable construction rules you used for the DVs, racism scale, race/religion dummies, and the filters), I can pinpoint which specific recode/filter step is causing the largest divergences (especially the “dropped_zero_variance” errors and the Model 2 racism sign/size problem).
