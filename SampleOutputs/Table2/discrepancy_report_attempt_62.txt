Score: 28/100
============================================================

### A. Global/structural mismatches (these will prevent *any* coefficient-level match)

1) **Wrong analytic sample size (N) in both models**
- **Generated:** N = 257 for Model 1 and Model 2 (and DV descriptives show full-sample N≈1100 but analytic N=257).
- **True (Bryson 1996):** N = 644 (Model 1) and N = 605 (Model 2).
- **Why it matters:** Different N implies different missing-data handling, different variable construction, or accidental subsetting—so coefficients/significance won’t match.
- **Fix:** Recreate the analytic samples to match the paper:
  - Use the same survey/year (1993 GSS) and the same inclusion rules Bryson used.
  - Use **listwise deletion on the variables in each model** (so Model 1 and Model 2 can legitimately have different N).
  - Ensure you did *not* (a) restrict to respondents with complete data on *both* DVs, (b) drop cases due to constructing “racism score” too strictly, or (c) accidentally filter to a subgroup.

2) **“No religion” wrongly dropped for “no variation”**
- **Generated:** `No religion (RELIG==4)` is `NaN` and labeled “dropped (no variation)” in both models; `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion`.
- **True:** “No religion” is included with nonzero coefficients in both models (0.057 in M1; 0.024 in M2).
- **Why it matters:** Your sample/recoding made `no_religion` constant (likely all 0s), which is a clear construction/subset error.
- **Fix:** Recode religion correctly and/or fix the sample restriction that removed all “no religion” cases.
  - In GSS, religion typically isn’t `RELIG==4` for “none” in many years; it is often `RELIG==4` **or** a different coding like `RELIG==0/3` depending on the dataset extract. Verify with codebook/frequencies.
  - Don’t use “DENOM==…” without confirming it’s defined for non-Protestants; handle denominational missingness correctly.

3) **Conservative Protestant definition is not the paper’s**
- **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1 (Baptist))”.
- **True table variable:** “Conservative Protestant” (not “Baptist-only Protestant”).
- **Why it matters:** Limiting to Baptists is not equivalent; will distort coefficients and also change “no religion” variation if religion coding is wrong.
- **Fix:** Implement the standard “conservative Protestant/evangelical Protestant” classification used in that era (often based on denominational family codes), not a single denomination. Use the same Bryson coding if available; if not, use a recognized GSS religious tradition scheme (e.g., Steensland et al.) and map to Bryson’s category as closely as possible.

4) **Model fit statistics don’t match (R², Adj R², Constant)**
- **Generated Model 1:** R²=0.174, Adj R²=0.137, Constant=2.664
- **True Model 1:** R²=0.145, Adj R²=0.129, Constant=2.415
- **Generated Model 2:** R²=0.149, Adj R²=0.111, Constant=5.357
- **True Model 2:** R²=0.147, Adj R²=0.130, Constant=7.860
- **Fix:** Once sample and variable constructions match, R² and intercepts should move toward the paper’s. Also ensure:
  - DV scaling matches (counts must match Bryson’s coding; see below).
  - Use **OLS** with the same treatment of weights (if Bryson used weights; many GSS analyses do). If you ran unweighted but the paper weighted, coefficients/SEs can differ.

5) **Standard errors are requested but the “true results” do not contain them**
- **Generated Results:** you show no SEs either—only standardized betas and significance stars.
- **True Results:** explicitly states *no SEs reported*.
- **Mismatch type:** If your generated narrative claims SE comparisons, that’s impossible against the paper.
- **Fix:** Do not claim you matched SEs to Bryson. If you need SEs, you must compute them from the microdata and then you can only compare *your* SEs across reproductions, not to the printed table.

### B. Variable-name / variable-definition mismatches

6) **Race categories likely misaligned**
- **Generated:** `Black (RACE==2)`, `Other race (RACE==3)` and Hispanic derived from `ETHNIC in {15..38}`.
- **True:** Uses “Black,” “Hispanic,” “Other race” as in the table, but the GSS coding in 1993 commonly has:
  - RACE: 1=White, 2=Black, 3=Other (fine), **but** Hispanic is often *not* reliably captured by ETHNIC codes the way you did unless it matches Bryson’s exact coding.
- **Fix:** Replicate Bryson’s Hispanic/ethnicity construction. If Bryson used “Hispanic” from a specific GSS Hispanic-origin variable (or a particular ETHNIC recode), your `{15..38}` rule may be wrong and may also be creating excess missingness (shrinking N).

7) **Income per capita construction may not match**
- **Generated:** `income_pc = REALINC/HOMPOP`.
- **True label:** “Household income per capita.”
- **Potential mismatch:** Bryson may have used a different income measure (e.g., total family income categories, or an inflation-adjusted measure) and/or handled household size differently.
- **Fix:** Verify the exact GSS variable Bryson used for income and household size and the transformation (and whether logged). Your current approach may be reasonable but must match the paper to match coefficients.

8) **DV construction likely differs (counts of dislikes)**
- **Generated:** DV is “count of 6” and “count of 12,” which sounds aligned.
- **But the intercept in Model 2 is wildly off** (5.357 vs 7.860), suggesting the DV scale/coding differs (e.g., what constitutes “dislike,” how missing/neutral coded, inclusion of “never heard,” etc.).
- **Fix:** Match Bryson’s exact “dislike” coding rule for each genre:
  - Which response categories count as “dislike” (e.g., “dislike,” “strongly dislike,” maybe also “don’t like at all”)?
  - Are “never heard,” “don’t know,” and missing treated as missing for that item (thus reducing the count denominator) or treated as not-dislike?
  - Ensure the **same set of genres** in each index and that “remaining 12” exactly matches Bryson’s list.

### C. Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I list **every variable where the generated standardized beta/significance differs from Bryson’s printed table**, by model.

## Model 1 mismatches (DV: minority-linked genres; True N=644)

| Variable | Generated β (Sig) | True β (Sig) | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | 0.142* | 0.130** | Significance level differs (* vs **); coef slightly high | Fix N/weights/DV & racism scale construction to recover p<.01 and exact β |
| Education | -0.253*** | -0.175*** | Coef too negative (magnitude off) | Fix sample + education coding (years vs degrees) and weighting; ensure standardized correctly |
| Income pc | -0.016 (ns) | -0.037 (ns) | Coef magnitude off | Fix income measure & per-capita construction |
| Occ prestige | +0.056 (ns) | -0.020 (ns) | **Sign flip** | Fix prestige variable/coding (different prestige scale? missing handling); sample/weights can flip small effects |
| Female | -0.036 (ns) | -0.057 (ns) | Magnitude off | Likely sample/weights |
| Age | +0.167** | +0.163*** | Sig differs (** vs ***) | Fix N (power) and correct model spec/weights |
| Black | -0.174* | -0.132*** | Much stronger negative but *only* one star (inconsistent with magnitude) | Indicates SE/p-values not comparable due to N=257; fix sample size and race/Hispanic coding |
| Hispanic | -0.058 (ns) | -0.058 (ns) | **Matches coefficient** (good) | Keep but ensure coding isn’t accidentally reproducing by chance; still fix N |
| Other race | +0.007 (ns) | -0.017 (ns) | Sign + magnitude off | Fix race coding and sample |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.102 (ns) | +0.063 (ns) | Too large | Fix religious tradition coding (not “Baptist proxy”) |
| No religion | dropped | +0.057 (ns) | **Omitted variable error** | Fix religion recode so it varies; include it |
| Southern | -0.057 (ns) | +0.024 (ns) | **Sign flip** | Fix region coding (REGION categories may not match “South”); fix sample/weights |

Also:
- **Constant:** 2.664*** vs **2.415*** (mismatch)
- **R²:** 0.174 vs **0.145** (mismatch)
- **Adj R²:** 0.137 vs **0.129** (mismatch)
- **N:** 257 vs **644** (mismatch)

## Model 2 mismatches (DV: remaining 12; True N=605)

| Variable | Generated β (Sig) | True β (Sig) | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | -0.007 (ns) | +0.080 (ns) | **Sign and magnitude wrong** | Biggest red flag: DV construction and/or racism index construction/sample restriction is wrong |
| Education | -0.158* | -0.242*** | Too small and wrong sig | Fix sample, DV, and education coding; N should be 605 |
| Income pc | -0.076 (ns) | -0.065 (ns) | Close-ish | Still fix income coding; could converge after other fixes |
| Occ prestige | -0.082 (ns) | +0.005 (ns) | **Sign flip and magnitude wrong** | Fix prestige measure and sample |
| Female | -0.092 (ns) | -0.070 (ns) | Magnitude off | Likely sample/weights |
| Age | +0.109 (ns) | +0.126** | Sig mismatch | Fix N and DV |
| Black | +0.046 (ns) | +0.042 (ns) | Very close (good) | Still ensure coding matches |
| Hispanic | -0.102 (ns) | -0.029 (ns) | Too negative | Fix Hispanic coding and/or DV items (some “remaining” genres may correlate with Hispanic differently) |
| Other race | +0.140* | +0.047 (ns) | Too large and wrong sig | Fix race coding and sample |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.124 (ns) | +0.048 (ns) | Too large | Fix conservative Protestant definition |
| No religion | dropped | +0.024 (ns) | **Omitted variable error** | Fix religion recode |
| Southern | +0.105 (ns) | +0.069 (ns) | Too large | Fix region coding & weights |

Also:
- **Constant:** 5.357*** vs **7.860** (major mismatch; also note Bryson prints no stars here)
- **R²:** 0.149 vs **0.147** (close)
- **Adj R²:** 0.111 vs **0.130** (off)
- **N:** 257 vs **605** (mismatch)

### D. Interpretation/significance mismatches

9) **You are using significance stars derived from your model’s p-values, but comparing to Bryson’s stars**
- With N=257 instead of ~600, your p-values and stars will differ even if betas were similar.
- **Fix:** First replicate **N and coding**, then compare stars. Also ensure you use **two-tailed tests** (Bryson does).

10) **Intercept interpretation is not aligned**
- Bryson reports a Model 2 constant of **7.860**; your intercept is **5.357***. This is not a small discrepancy; it usually means DV coding differs (e.g., different mean due to different “dislike” thresholds or missing handling).
- **Fix:** Reconstruct the DV indices exactly as Bryson did; check means in the analytic sample against what they should be (you currently show Model 2 analytic mean ≈3.65 on a 0–12 scale; Bryson’s intercept suggests a much higher baseline, consistent with a different scaling or different centering/standardization handling for the intercept).

### E. What to change so the generated analysis matches Bryson (priority order)

1) **Rebuild the two analytic samples to hit N≈644 and N≈605**
- Don’t force the same respondents for both models unless the paper did.
- Apply listwise deletion per model using the same missing rules as Bryson.

2) **Fix religion variables**
- Correct the “no religion” coding so it varies and is included.
- Replace the “Baptist proxy” with a real conservative Protestant classification consistent with Bryson.

3) **Verify DV construction (the biggest driver of your Model 2 failures)**
- Confirm the exact 6 “minority-linked” genres and the exact “remaining 12.”
- Confirm which responses count as “dislike” and how “don’t know/never heard” are treated.
- Recompute DV descriptives *in the analytic sample* and compare to expected distribution (you may need to infer from Bryson or reproduce from data).

4) **Verify racism scale**
- Your label says “strict 5 items, sum.” If Bryson’s racism index used different items, different handling of missing, or different scaling, your N will collapse and coefficients will drift.
- Ensure you use the same items and missing rule (e.g., allow 1 missing item and prorate vs strict complete-case).

5) **Confirm education, income, prestige coding**
- Education: years vs degree categories can change standardized betas.
- Income: match the exact measure and transformation.
- Prestige: ensure you’re using the same prestige scale (and that higher values mean higher prestige).

6) **Weights and design effects**
- If Bryson used GSS weights and you didn’t (or vice versa), betas and especially p-values/stars can differ.
- Apply the appropriate weight variable if the paper did.

If you want, paste your code (or at least the variable construction steps for the two DVs, racism score, religion, and the exact filtering rules). Then I can point to the exact line(s) that are causing N=257 and the “no religion has no variation” failure.
