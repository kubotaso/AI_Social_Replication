Score: 35/100
============================================================

Below is a point-by-point audit of **every mismatch** between your *Generated Results* and the *True Results* from Bryson (1996) Table 2. I group discrepancies into: (A) sample/model fit, (B) coefficients & signs, (C) significance markers, (D) constants, (E) variable naming/definition issues, and then (F) concrete fixes to make the generated analysis match the paper.

---

## A) Model/sample size and fit statistics: major mismatches

### 1) N (analytic sample sizes) do not match the paper
- **True:** Model 1 N=**644**; Model 2 N=**605**
- **Generated:** Model A N=**433**; Model B N=**404**

**Fix:** Your replication is dropping far more cases than Bryson’s. This is almost always due to:
- over-strict missing-data handling (listwise deletion on variables that Bryson didn’t use, or created with extra missingness),
- misconstructed religion/denomination variables (your “Conservative Protestant proxy” creates additional missingness),
- mis-specified race/Hispanic measures (e.g., using a field not present for many cases),
- different survey/year subset than the paper’s analytic sample.

You need to reproduce **exactly the same sample restrictions** (year, population, nonmissing DV, and nonmissing IVs as *constructed in the paper*), and avoid creating new missingness.

### 2) R² and Adjusted R² are wrong
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R²=**0.145**, Adj R²=**0.129**  
  - Model 2 R²=**0.147**, Adj R²=**0.130**
- **Generated:**  
  - Model A R²=**0.1266**, Adj=**0.1016**  
  - Model B R²=**0.1248**, Adj=**0.0979**

**Fix:** Once the sample and variable constructions match, these will move toward the published values. If they still don’t: confirm you are using **standard OLS**, not robust SEs, not weights (unless Bryson used them), and the same DV construction.

## B) Coefficients: every mismatch (value and/or sign)

### Model 1 (paper) vs Generated Model A

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130** | 0.127492 | close, but sig differs (see section C) |
| Education | **-0.175** | -0.203183 | magnitude mismatch |
| Household income per capita | **-0.037** | **+0.036747** | **sign flip** |
| Occupational prestige | **-0.020** | +0.000503 | sign/magnitude mismatch |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.075630 | magnitude mismatch |
| Age | **0.163** | 0.137203 | magnitude mismatch + sig differs |
| Black | **-0.132** | -0.146756 | magnitude mismatch + sig differs |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.061425 | close |
| Other race | **-0.017** | **+0.011185** | **sign flip** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.091537 | magnitude mismatch |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.072531 | magnitude mismatch |
| Southern | **0.024** | **-0.017448** | **sign flip** |

**Key issues in Model A:** income sign is wrong; Southern sign is wrong; “Other race” sign is wrong; prestige effect is near zero instead of negative.

---

### Model 2 (paper) vs Generated Model B

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.080** | **-0.030484** | **sign flip** |
| Education | **-0.242** | -0.219592 | magnitude mismatch |
| Household income per capita | -0.065 | -0.029269 | magnitude mismatch |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.030192 | sign/magnitude mismatch |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.087691 | magnitude mismatch |
| Age | **0.126** | 0.094485 | magnitude mismatch + sig differs |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.067243 | magnitude mismatch |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.090451 | magnitude mismatch |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.086744 | magnitude mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.081027 | magnitude mismatch |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.018589 | close |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.090125 | magnitude mismatch |

**Key issue in Model B:** racism has the wrong sign (negative instead of positive), and prestige has the wrong sign.

## C) Significance markers: systematic mismatches

### 1) Racism significance in Model 1 is wrong
- **True Model 1:** Racism = **0.130\*\*** (p<.01)
- **Generated Model A:** Racism = 0.127492 with **\*** only

**Fix:** once N and exact variable construction match, p-values should align. Right now your smaller N and/or different racism scale construction changes SEs/p-values.

### 2) Age significance in Model 1 is wrong
- **True Model 1:** Age = 0.163*** (p<.001)
- **Generated Model A:** Age = 0.137203 ** (p<.01)

### 3) Black significance in Model 1 is wrong
- **True Model 1:** Black = -0.132***  
- **Generated Model A:** -0.146756 **

### 4) Racism significance in Model 2 is missing AND sign is wrong
- **True Model 2:** Racism = 0.080 (no stars)
- **Generated Model B:** -0.030484 (no stars)

### 5) Age significance in Model 2 is missing
- **True Model 2:** Age = 0.126**  
- **Generated Model B:** Age has no stars

**Fix for all significance mismatches:** They will not match unless:
1) the **analytic sample N** matches, and  
2) variables are coded identically (especially religion/region/race/Hispanic), and  
3) you compute p-values in the same way (plain OLS t-tests; two-tailed).

---

## D) Constants: wrong in both models

- **True Model 1 constant:** **2.415***  
  **Generated Model A constant:** **2.666397*** (too high)

- **True Model 2 constant:** **7.860** (printed without stars in your provided “True Results”)  
  **Generated Model B constant:** **5.706493*** (far lower and starred)

**Fix:** constants are extremely sensitive to:
- DV construction (counts and which genres included),
- centering/standardization choices (see below),
- sample composition.

Also: Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients**, but constants in such tables are often from the **unstandardized equation** (papers vary). You must confirm whether Bryson’s constant is from the unstandardized model with standardized slopes reported, or from a fully standardized model. Your generated output appears internally inconsistent with the table’s numbers.

---

## E) Variable naming/definition and interpretation mismatches

### 1) You report SEs nowhere—but your instruction asks to compare SEs
- **True table:** explicitly **does not report standard errors**.
- **Generated:** also does not report SEs—so there’s **nothing to compare**.

**Fix:** Don’t claim/attempt SE matching. If you want SEs, you must compute them yourself from the replication data, but they will not be “true results” from the table because the paper doesn’t provide them.

### 2) “Racism score (0–5; strict sum of 5 dichotomies)” may not match Bryson’s scale construction
Even if the range matches, “strict sum of 5 dichotomies” is a red flag:
- Bryson’s racism index may use a particular handling of DK/NA, reversals, or item selection that differs from yours.
- Differences here can flip signs (especially in Model 2 where your racism is negative but should be +0.080).

**Fix:** Rebuild the racism index exactly as in the paper/appendix/codebook:
- same items,
- same coding direction,
- same missing handling (often: require at least k valid items and rescale, rather than “strict sum” requiring all 5).

### 3) Hispanic indicator construction is not faithful
Generated label:  
> “Hispanic (indicator; uses HISpanic field if present else ETHNIC proxy)”

That is not a replication—it's a fallback heuristic that will change who is coded Hispanic.

**Fix:** Use the **exact variable Bryson used** (likely GSS `HISPANIC` or the specific year’s ethnicity item). No proxy logic.

### 4) Conservative Protestant coding is almost certainly wrong and creates missingness
Generated label:
> “proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM in {1,6}; protestants w/ missing DENOM -> missing”

This likely deviates from Bryson (1996). Conservative Protestant classification in GSS is commonly done via RELTRAD-style coding (Steensland et al. later formalized), often using denomination plus tradition—*not* a simple DENOM∈{1,6}. Also, setting missing DENOM to missing will shrink N dramatically.

**Fix:** Implement the same scheme Bryson used in 1996 (check paper notes). Critically:
- Do **not** turn large swaths of Protestants into missing because DENOM is missing, unless Bryson did.
- If Bryson used a simpler “fundamentalist” or “born again” measure, use that instead.

### 5) Region coding: “Southern (REGION==3)” likely mismatched
Your “South” dummy yields **negative** in Model A, but Bryson’s is **positive**.

This could be:
- wrong REGION coding,
- wrong reference category,
- misread numeric codes (e.g., REGION==3 may not be South),
- using a different region variable than Bryson.

**Fix:** Verify REGION coding in that year’s data and recode South exactly as in the paper.

### 6) Reporting/interpretation mismatch: you are calling them “ModelA_Std_Beta”
Good: the table should be standardized coefficients.

But you must ensure your computation equals the paper’s:
- standardized betas from OLS are usually: run OLS on standardized X and standardized Y, or compute \( \beta^* = b \cdot (SD_X/SD_Y)\).
- If you standardized X but not Y (or vice versa), you will not match.
- If you used a different SD (sample vs population, weighted vs unweighted), betas shift.

**Fix:** Compute standardized coefficients the same way Bryson did (almost certainly unweighted sample SDs within the analytic sample). Use the same sample for SDs.

---

## F) How to fix the generated analysis so it matches the paper

### Step 1: Match the analytic sample (this is the biggest driver)
- Restrict to the **same survey year/data release** used in Bryson (1996) Table 2.
- Use the **same inclusion criteria** (e.g., nonmissing music dislike items, etc.).
- Avoid introducing extra missingness through proxy variables (religion/Hispanic).

Target Ns: **644** and **605** after listwise deletion on the *paper’s* covariates.

### Step 2: Reconstruct DVs exactly
Your DV means/SDs and constants suggest the DV construction may differ.
- Ensure the “minority-linked genres: 6” set is exactly the 6 in the note.
- Ensure the “remaining 12” excludes exactly those 6 and includes exactly the other 12 asked in that year.
- Ensure “dislike” is coded exactly like Bryson (e.g., dislike vs neutral; handling of “don’t know”).

### Step 3: Recode key IVs to paper definitions (to fix sign flips)
- **Income per capita:** Bryson’s Model 1 coefficient is **negative** (-0.037), yours is **positive**.  
  Likely causes: inverted DV coding, wrong income scaling, or per-capita computation inconsistent with the paper.
- **South:** verify REGION mapping; yours likely miscoded.
- **Other race:** verify reference category and dummy coding; yours sign flips in Model 1.
- **Racism index:** rebuild; your Model 2 sign flip strongly suggests miscoding/standardization/sample mismatch.

### Step 4: Ensure standardized coefficients are computed correctly
- Run OLS and then compute standardized betas using analytic-sample SDs for X and Y, or regress on z-scored variables (both sides).
- Confirm you are not standardizing dummies in a nonstandard way relative to the paper (Bryson’s “standardized coefficient for dummies” is standard practice, but must use SD of the dummy in-sample).

### Step 5: Align significance stars to the paper
- Use **two-tailed** t-tests with plain OLS SEs.
- Do not use robust SEs unless confirmed in the paper (Bryson’s table presentation suggests conventional OLS inference).
- Once coefficients and N match, stars should line up:
  - Model 1: racism **, education ***, age ***, black ***
  - Model 2: education ***, age **

---

### Minimal “must-fix” list (if you prioritize)
1) Fix analytic sample to get **N=644 / 605**.  
2) Fix **Hispanic** and **Conservative Protestant** coding (stop proxy fallbacks that create missingness).  
3) Fix **REGION/South** coding.  
4) Rebuild **racism score** per the paper (likely your biggest cause of Model 2 sign error).  
5) Recompute standardized betas in a way consistent with the table.

If you share (i) the code used to build the racism index, (ii) the exact GSS variables used for Hispanic and religion, and (iii) your sample restriction steps, I can pinpoint which step is causing each sign flip (income, South, racism in Model 2) rather than only listing likely causes.
