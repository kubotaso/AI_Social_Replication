============================================================

Below is a line‑by‑line audit of mismatches between your **Generated Results** and Bryson (1996) **Table 2 true results**, plus what to change so the generated output can match the paper.

---

## 1) Fundamental output/estimation mismatches (these prevent a match even if code is “right”)

### 1.1 Wrong analytic sample sizes (N)
- **True (paper):** Model 1 N=**644**, Model 2 N=**605**
- **Generated:** both models N=**257**
- **Fix:** Your data construction is dropping far too many cases. To match the paper you must reproduce **Bryson’s listwise deletion rules and variable construction** (and possibly the same survey subset).
  - Audit where cases are lost:
    - racism scale “strict complete-case sum” (see §2.1) likely deletes many.
    - “Hispanic nonresponse left missing” + “Other race requires nonmissing Hispanic” (see §2.5) creates extra missingness.
    - “Conservative Protestant proxy” requiring RELIG & DENOM (see §2.6) may drop many.
    - income_pc construction may be creating missingness (HOMPOP=0? missing?).
  - Target: after applying the *paper’s* missing-data rules you should land near N≈644 and 605 (not necessarily exact unless you have identical GSS extract/filters).

### 1.2 You dropped “No religion” due to “no variation” (but paper estimates it)
- **True:** No religion has coefficients **0.057** (Model 1) and **0.024** (Model 2).
- **Generated:** `No religion (RELIG==4)` is **NaN** and “dropped (no variation)” in both models.
- **Fix:** This is a clear coding/sample error:
  - Either RELIG==4 is not “no religion” in your coding, **or**
  - you recoded RELIG incorrectly, **or**
  - your analytic sample restriction inadvertently excludes all RELIG==4 cases.
- Minimal fix checklist:
  1. Verify RELIG coding in the dataset year (GSS coding changes across extracts). Confirm which value corresponds to “none.”
  2. Create `no_religion = 1 if RELIG indicates none else 0`, and **do not** filter out those cases.
  3. Ensure listwise deletion is not applied before this recode in a way that removes all “none.”

### 1.3 You are reporting significance stars but not using the same inferential setup
- **True:** stars correspond to two‑tailed tests; SEs are not printed but were implicitly used.
- **Generated:** stars appear, but because N and coefficients differ, your p-values will differ anyway.
- **Fix:** After you replicate variable coding and N, compute p-values from the OLS model (two‑tailed) and apply the same cutoffs.

## 2) Variable-name / variable-definition mismatches

### 2.1 Racism score construction is not aligned
- **True variable:** “Racism score” (0–5), but the paper’s construction is not described in your generated label.
- **Generated label:** “5 dichotomous items, strict complete‑case sum”
- **Problem:** “strict complete-case sum” is very likely not what Bryson did (or not what produces their N). Many GSS scales allow partial nonresponse (e.g., require ≥k items and prorate/mean, or treat DK as midpoint, etc.).
- **Fix:** Reconstruct racism score exactly per Bryson:
  - Locate the paper’s methods appendix / measure description for the exact 5 items and handling of DK/NA.
  - Implement the same rule (e.g., allow partial completion, or code DK/NA as missing but require fewer items).
  - Recompute N impact after this change.

### 2.2 Education
- **True variable name in table:** “Education”
- **Generated:** “Education (years)” — that’s fine if it’s years of schooling, but confirm it matches Bryson’s coding (often `EDUC` years).
- **Potential issue:** If you used a different education measure or recode, coefficients will drift.
- **Fix:** Use the same education variable/coding as in Bryson (likely GSS `EDUC` in years).

### 2.3 Occupational prestige sign flips suggest a definition mismatch
- **True coefficients:** Model 1 **-0.020**; Model 2 **0.005** (near zero)
- **Generated:** Model 1 **+0.055**; Model 2 **-0.093**
- **Fix:** Verify:
  - you used the correct prestige variable (paper might use a different prestige scale than `PRESTG80`, or different imputation).
  - you didn’t reverse-code prestige or standardize with wrong sign (rare but can happen if multiplied by -1 or using rank inversions).
  - you’re using the same employed/occupation universe rules as the paper (prestige missing for nonworkers often handled specially).

### 2.4 Southern (REGION==3) is likely miscoded
- **True:** Southern **0.024** (Model 1), **0.069** (Model 2) — both positive.
- **Generated:** Model 1 **-0.055**; Model 2 **0.125*** (positive and significant)
- **Fix:** Confirm what counts as “South” in Bryson:
  - Paper may use **Census region South** or a different regional grouping.
  - `REGION==3` may not be “South” in your dataset coding. In some GSS codings, region categories differ.
  - Recode south using the correct category mapping.

### 2.5 “Other race requires nonmissing Hispanic” is not how Table 2 is structured
- **True:** race dummies are Black, Hispanic, Other race (with White as reference).
- **Generated:** “Other race (residual nonwhite, nonblack, nonhispanic; requires nonmissing Hispanic)”
- **Problems:**
  1. You are conditioning “other race” on Hispanic nonmissing, which can create missingness and change N.
  2. Your Hispanic variable “nonresponse left missing” will reduce N further.
- **Fix:** Create mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories in a way that matches the paper:
  - White (reference)
  - Black
  - Hispanic
  - Other (all remaining)
  - Handle missing ethnicity/race in the same way as Bryson (often listwise delete on those items, but do not make “Other” depend on Hispanic being observed unless the paper did).
  - If ethnicity nonresponse exists, decide whether Bryson treated it as non-Hispanic or missing—this affects N and coefficients.

### 2.6 Conservative Protestant proxy is not the same construct
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant” (no mention of “Protestant & Baptist” proxy in the table)
- **Generated:** “proxy: Protestant & Baptist”
- **Fix:** Bryson’s “conservative Protestant” likely uses a denominational classification scheme (e.g., RELTRAD-style categories or fundamentalist/moderate/liberal Protestant typology). Your proxy will not reproduce his coefficients.
  - Implement the same classification rule Bryson used.
  - Do not require DENOM if the original measure didn’t (or if it used a different question set).

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (every variable)

I list **True vs Generated** standardized betas.

### Model 1 (Minority-linked 6 genres)

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130**\*\* | **0.142**\* | size + significance differ |
| Education | **-0.175**\*\*\* | **-0.253**\*\*\* | too negative |
| Income pc | -0.037 | -0.020 | too small (closer to 0) |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | +0.055 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.037 | smaller magnitude |
| Age | **0.163**\*\*\* | **0.167**\*\* | similar size, sig differs |
| Black | **-0.132**\*\*\* | **-0.175**\* | too negative, sig differs |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.055 | close (ok) |
| Other race | -0.017 | +0.017 | wrong sign |
| Cons Protestant | 0.063 | 0.102 | too large |
| No religion | 0.057 | dropped/NaN | missing term |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.055 | wrong sign |

### Model 2 (Remaining 12 genres)

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.007 | wrong sign |
| Education | **-0.242**\*\*\* | -0.159\* | much weaker + wrong sig |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.092 | too negative |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.093 | wrong sign + too large |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.094 | somewhat more negative |
| Age | 0.126\*\* | 0.107 | weaker + sig differs |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.043 | essentially matches (good) |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.067 | too negative |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.192\*\* | far too large |
| Cons Protestant | 0.048 | 0.128 | too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | dropped/NaN | missing term |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.125\* | too large + sig differs |

## 4) Fit statistics / constants mismatches

### 4.1 Constants
- **True:** Model 1 constant **2.415***; Model 2 constant **7.860** (no stars shown in your transcription)
- **Generated:** 2.667*** (Model A) and 5.427*** (Model B)
- **Fix:** Once you fix DV construction and sample/coding, constants should move. But note: constants in standardized-beta tables are often from unstandardized regression while betas are standardized; ensure you’re reproducing what the table prints.

### 4.2 R² / Adjusted R²
- **True:** R² ≈ **0.145/0.147**, Adj R² ≈ **0.129/0.130**
- **Generated:** R² **0.174/0.165**, Adj R² **0.137/0.128**
- **Fix:** R² will change with DV definition, sample, and predictors. Primary driver here is you are not estimating the same model/sample.

---

## 5) Interpretation/reporting mismatches

### 5.1 You imply “No religion” is absent because of no variation
- **True interpretation:** It exists and is estimated (small positive coefficients).
- **Fix:** Correct the data coding so “No religion” varies and is included, then revise narrative: “No religion shows small positive associations and is not statistically significant” (as per table’s lack of stars).

### 5.2 Race/ethnicity interpretation depends on correct reference category
- **True:** coefficients are for Black/Hispanic/Other relative to the omitted category (almost certainly White).
- **Generated:** because you made “Other race” depend on Hispanic nonmissing and likely have different omissions, the interpretation may not match.
- **Fix:** Ensure exactly one omitted reference group (White, non-Hispanic, etc.) as Bryson does.

---

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Replicate the DV construction exactly**
   - Ensure the 6 “minority-linked” genres and the “remaining 12” correspond exactly to Bryson’s items and coding of “dislike.”
   - Verify how “dislike” is defined (e.g., rating scale threshold, “dislike” vs “neutral,” handling of “don’t know”).

2. **Rebuild racism score per Bryson**
   - Same items, same direction, same missing-data rule (do not enforce “complete-case” unless paper did).

3. **Correct religion variables**
   - Fix RELIG coding for “none.”
   - Implement Bryson’s “Conservative Protestant” classification, not the Baptist proxy.

4. **Correct region coding**
   - Verify which REGION category equals “South” in your extract; recode accordingly.

5. **Correct race/ethnicity dummies**
   - Create mutually exclusive categories aligned with the paper.
   - Don’t create extra missingness by making “Other” depend on Hispanic being observed unless that is explicitly Bryson’s approach.

6. **Match sample restrictions**
   - Bryson uses 1993 GSS music module; ensure you use the same year(s), and same inclusion rules (e.g., adults, noninstitutionalized—already GSS—but possibly exclude Blacks/Hispanics? no, he includes them; exclude missing DV; listwise delete on covariates).

7. **Re-estimate OLS and report standardized betas**
   - Use OLS with unstandardized variables but report standardized coefficients (or standardize all variables and run OLS; be careful with binaries).
   - Apply two-tailed p-value star thresholds.

If you paste your code (or at least: (a) how you coded each DV, (b) which 5 racism items and missing rules, (c) how you coded RELIG/DENOM/Conservative Protestant, (d) how you defined race/ethnicity and “South”), I can pinpoint exactly which line(s) are driving the N=257 collapse and the specific sign reversals (prestige, south, other race, racism in Model 2).
