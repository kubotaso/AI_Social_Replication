Score: 0/100
============================================================

Below is a point-by-point audit of the **Generated Results** against the **True Results (Bryson 1996, Table 2)**. The generated output diverges so extensively that it cannot be “patched” by small edits—you need to re-run the correct models on the correct dataset, and then format the table to match Bryson’s reporting (standardized betas; no SEs).

---

## 1) Sample size / dataset mismatch (fatal)

### Mismatch
- **True N:** Model 1 = **644**, Model 2 = **605**
- **Generated N:** Model 1 = **261**, Model 2 = **259**

### Why it’s a problem
Different N implies a different analytic sample (likely a different dataset, different wave, excessive listwise deletion, or unintended subsetting). Coefficients, R², and significance will not match.

### Fix
- Use the **same dataset and same inclusion criteria** as Bryson (1996).
- Replicate **the same missing-data handling** (likely listwise deletion on model variables, but resulting N must match 644 and 605).
- Verify the DV construction and that both models use the intended respondents (e.g., not restricting to one race/region, not accidentally filtering).

---

## 2) Dependent variables: construction/scale mismatch (likely fatal)

### Mismatch evidence
- Generated DVs look like **counts** with small ranges:
  - `dv1_minority6_dislikes` shows values like 0–6
  - `dv2_remaining12_dislikes` shows values like 0–12
- Bryson’s table uses the same DV labels, but the intercepts and sample sizes suggest the paper’s DV may not be your constructed count (or is based on a different scaling/weighting).

### Specific mismatches
- **Model 2 constant**
  - True: **7.860** (not marked significant in the printed table)
  - Generated: **5.185*** (and even the star is inconsistent with Bryson’s presentation)

### Fix
- Reconstruct DVs **exactly** as in Bryson:
  - Confirm which genres are included in each DV.
  - Confirm whether “dislike” is dichotomized per genre, averaged, summed, or otherwise scaled.
  - Confirm how “don’t know,” nonresponse, or neutral responses are treated.
- Once DVs match, the intercepts and distributions should align much more closely.

## 3) Model fit (R² / Adj. R²) mismatch

### Mismatch
- **Model 1 R²**
  - True: **0.145** (Adj 0.129)
  - Generated: **0.178** (Adj 0.142)
- **Model 2 R²**
  - True: **0.147** (Adj 0.130)
  - Generated: **0.151** (Adj 0.114)

### Fix
R² will fall into place only after fixing:
1) dataset/sample (N),
2) DV construction,
3) predictor coding (esp. region/religion/race),
4) standardization method.

---

## 4) Variable presence/coding errors: “No religion” incorrectly dropped

### Mismatch
- True table includes **No religion** with nonzero coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**
- Generated output shows **No religion = NaN; dropped (no variation)** in both models, and “Dropped_no_variation = no_religion”.

### Why it’s a problem
“No variation” is almost certainly false in a national survey sample. This indicates:
- a coding bug (e.g., all values set to 0 due to recode),
- a mistaken subset (e.g., only religious respondents retained),
- or the variable was constructed incorrectly (e.g., boolean compared to strings; missing coded as 0).

### Fix
- Inspect frequency: `tab no_religion` / `value_counts()`.
- Recreate the dummy correctly from the original religion variable.
- Ensure missing values are not being recoded to 0.
- Ensure you didn’t subset in a way that forces all cases to have `no_religion==0`.

---

## 5) Variable name mismatch (minor but indicates non-replication)

### Mismatch
Generated uses:
- `age_years` (label “Age”) — ok conceptually
- `income_pc` (label “Household income per capita”) — ok conceptually

But the bigger issue is **not naming**, it’s **coding/definition** (see below). Still, to match Bryson’s table output, labels should mirror the paper’s labels exactly.

### Fix
- Keep your internal names, but map them to Bryson labels when producing the table:
  - `racism_score` → “Racism score”
  - `education` → “Education”
  - `income_pc` → “Household income per capita”
  - `occ_prestige` → “Occupational prestige”
  - `female` → “Female”
  - `age_years` → “Age”
  - etc.

---

## 6) Coefficient mismatches (by variable, both models)

Bryson reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. Your generated “Std_Beta” values do not match those.

### Model 1 coefficient mismatches (True → Generated)

- Racism score: **0.130\*\*** → **0.140\*** (value and significance mismatch)
- Education: **-0.175\*\*\*** → **-0.260\*\*\*** (too large in magnitude)
- Household income pc: **-0.037** → **-0.012** (too small)
- Occupational prestige: **-0.020** → **+0.058** (wrong sign)
- Female: **-0.057** → **-0.034** (smaller magnitude)
- Age: **0.163\*\*\*** → **0.175\*\*** (significance mismatch)
- Black: **-0.132\*\*\*** → **-0.177\*** (magnitude and significance mismatch)
- Hispanic: **-0.058** → **-0.007** (too small)
- Other race: **-0.017** → **-0.005** (too small)
- Conservative Protestant: **0.063** → **0.120** (too large)
- No religion: **0.057** → **dropped/NaN** (incorrect)
- Southern: **0.024** → **-0.059** (wrong sign)
- Constant: **2.415\*\*\*** → **2.593\*\*\*** (mismatch)

### Model 2 coefficient mismatches (True → Generated)

- Racism score: **0.080** → **-0.013** (wrong sign)
- Education: **-0.242\*\*\*** → **-0.165\*** (too small magnitude and wrong sig)
- Household income pc: **-0.065** → **-0.077** (close-ish)
- Occupational prestige: **0.005** → **-0.079** (wrong sign)
- Female: **-0.070** → **-0.082** (close-ish)
- Age: **0.126\*\*** → **0.127\*** (sig mismatch)
- Black: **0.042** → **0.039** (very close)
- Hispanic: **-0.029** → **-0.023** (close)
- Other race: **0.047** → **0.122\*** (too large)
- Conservative Protestant: **0.048** → **0.142\*** (too large)
- No religion: **0.024** → **dropped/NaN** (incorrect)
- Southern: **0.069** → **0.104** (too large)
- Constant: **7.860** → **5.185\*\*\*** (mismatch; also Bryson doesn’t star it)

### Fix (for coefficient mismatches)
These mismatches are what you’d expect from:
- wrong N / wrong sample,
- incorrectly built DVs,
- incorrect dummy coding for religion/region/race,
- different standardization method,
- possibly omission of weights or use of different survey design assumptions.

To fix:
1) **Match sample sizes** first (N=644/605).
2) **Rebuild DVs** to match Bryson.
3) **Recode predictors** to match Bryson definitions (esp. “Southern,” “No religion,” “Conservative Protestant,” race dummies and reference categories).
4) **Compute standardized coefficients the same way** (see Section 7).

---

## 7) Significance markers mismatch (and likely computed from the wrong model)

### Mismatch
Many stars differ from Bryson even when coefficients are close (e.g., Age in Model 2: true ** vs generated *).

Also, Bryson’s Table 2 reports **only standardized coefficients and stars**—no SEs. Your generated output is internally computing p-values somehow, but given the wrong sample/model it won’t match.

### Fix
- Once the model is correctly replicated, generate p-values from the same OLS model Bryson used (two-tailed).
- Apply exactly Bryson’s thresholds: \* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.
- Do **not** add SE columns (Bryson didn’t report them). If you keep SEs for internal checks, omit them from the final table.

---

## 8) Interpretation mismatch (direction/sign implications)

Even without narrative text, the generated results imply interpretations that contradict Bryson because of sign flips:

- **Model 2 Racism score**
  - True: +0.080 (more racism → more dislike, though not significant)
  - Generated: -0.013 (more racism → *less* dislike)
  - Fix: will resolve when DV/sample/coding are corrected.

- **Model 1 Southern**
  - True: +0.024 (slightly more dislike among Southerners)
  - Generated: -0.059 (less dislike among Southerners)
  - Fix: check South dummy definition (Census South?) and sample/weights.

- **Occupational prestige** flips sign in both models relative to true values.
  - This strongly suggests the prestige variable is not the same measure/coding as Bryson (or you are standardizing after transformations inconsistently).

---

## 9) “Standard errors” requirement: True table has none

### Mismatch
Your prompt asks to compare SEs, but:
- **True results explicitly state no SEs are reported** in Bryson Table 2.
- Generated output also does not show SEs, but it does show stars.

### Fix
- You cannot “match” SEs to Bryson Table 2. The correct match target is:
  - standardized coefficients,
  - stars,
  - constant,
  - R² / Adj R²,
  - N.
- If you need SEs, you must compute them yourself—but they won’t be verifiable against Table 2.

---

## What to do to make the generated analysis match Bryson (minimum replication checklist)

1) **Use the correct source data** and confirm it corresponds to Bryson’s (year, survey, population).
2) **Recreate DV1 and DV2 exactly** (genre lists + “dislike” definition + missing handling).
3) **Recode predictors to match Bryson**
   - Race dummies with the same reference category
   - Conservative Protestant definition
   - No religion definition (must vary!)
   - Southern definition
4) **Run OLS with the same case handling**
   - listwise deletion consistent with reported N
   - apply weights if Bryson did (you must check the paper’s methods section)
5) **Report standardized coefficients**
   - Either fit on z-scored X and z-scored Y, or compute betas from unstandardized OLS using SD ratios—do it consistently with Bryson.
6) **Format output to match Table 2**
   - no SEs
   - correct stars
   - correct N/R²/Adj R²/constants

If you share (a) your code for constructing `dv1_minority6_dislikes`, `dv2_remaining12_dislikes`, and (b) how you coded `no_religion`, `cons_prot`, and `southern`, I can pinpoint the exact coding steps that are producing the sign flips and the “no variation” error.
