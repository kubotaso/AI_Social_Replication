Score: 15/100
============================================================

Below is a line‑by‑line audit of **every mismatch** between the Generated Results and Bryson (1996) Table 2 (“True Results”), plus what to change so the generated output matches the paper.

---

## 1) Big structural discrepancies (drive many downstream mismatches)

### 1.1 Wrong analytic sample sizes (N)
- **True:** Model 1 **N=644**; Model 2 **N=605**
- **Generated:** Model 1 **N=261**; Model 2 **N=259**

**Fix**
- Your model is being estimated on a much smaller subset (likely because of listwise deletion from variables you constructed, miscoding missing values, or over-restrictive filters).
- To match the paper, replicate Bryson’s inclusion rules:
  - Use **1993 GSS** only (paper’s year).
  - Ensure the DVs are constructed exactly as in the paper and that missing codes are handled correctly (e.g., GSS uses special missing codes like 8/9, 98/99 depending on variable).
  - Avoid accidentally dropping cases by constructing **income per capita**, **religion/denom**, **prestige**, etc. in a way that turns many values into missing.
  - Use the same listwise deletion set as the paper (i.e., only drop if missing on variables in that model).

Until N matches, coefficients will not match.

---

### 1.2 “No religion” incorrectly dropped (and shown as NaN)
- **True:** “No religion” is included with coefficients in both models:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**
- **Generated:** “No religion (RELIG==4)” is **NaN**, and `Dropped_no_variation_or_singularity = no_religion`

**Fix**
- You created `no_religion` but it has **no variation** in the analytic sample you ended up with (likely everyone is 0 due to a coding error or due to the sample restriction that eliminated all “no religion” respondents).
- Correct the coding:
  - Verify the GSS code for “none” in that year (often `RELIG==4`, but confirm in the 1993 codebook).
  - Ensure you didn’t recode missing values to 0.
  - Ensure `RELIG` wasn’t filtered (e.g., dropping all cases where denom is missing could eliminate nonreligious respondents if denom is only asked of the religious).

---

### 1.3 Conservative Protestant is defined differently than the paper
- **True variable:** “Conservative Protestant” (Bryson’s definition is not “RELIG==1 & DENOM==1” in general; it is usually built from denominational tradition / FUND / denomination family).
- **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”

**Fix**
- Rebuild Conservative Protestant using the paper’s classification (or the closest GSS standard scheme used in that era—often based on denomination family, sometimes `DENOM` + `OTHER` + Protestant indicator).
- A proxy definition will generally not reproduce coefficients.

---

### 1.4 Reported constants / intercepts do not match
- **True constants:**
  - Model 1: **2.415***  
  - Model 2: **7.860** (note: table shows it but no stars printed in your excerpt)
- **Generated constants:**
  - Model 1: **2.566***  
  - Model 2: **5.293***  

**Fix**
- Constants will not align until:
  1) DV construction matches exactly (range, item selection, coding), and  
  2) sample and predictors match (same coding, same categories), and  
  3) weights (if any) match Bryson’s approach (paper may use weights; if so and you didn’t, that can shift constants and coefficients).

---

### 1.5 R² / Adjusted R² do not match
- **True:**
  - Model 1: R² **0.145**, Adj R² **0.129**
  - Model 2: R² **0.147**, Adj R² **0.130**
- **Generated:**
  - Model 1: R² **0.178**, Adj R² **0.142**
  - Model 2: R² **0.159**, Adj R² **0.121**

**Fix**
- Same as above: match DV construction, sample (N), predictor coding, and weights.

---

## 2) Variable-name / definition mismatches

These are discrepancies in *labels/definitions* even when the name looks similar:

1) **Racism score**
- **True label:** “Racism score”
- **Generated label:** “Racism score (0–5)”
- Not necessarily wrong, but confirms you assumed a 0–5 scale. If Bryson’s racism index is constructed differently (or rescaled), that changes results.

**Fix:** replicate Bryson’s racism index construction exactly (items, coding direction, scaling, treatment of missing, possible averaging vs summing).

2) **Education**
- **True:** “Education” (usually years)
- **Generated:** “Education (years)” (fine), but coefficient mismatch indicates the coding/sample differs.

3) **Household income per capita**
- **True:** “Household income per capita”
- **Generated:** “Household income per capita (REALINC/HOMPOP)”
- Using `REALINC/HOMPOP` is plausible but must match Bryson’s exact construction (e.g., may use `INCOME` categories converted, top-coding handling, or different household size measure).

**Fix:** confirm the exact income variable and equivalization method in Bryson (1996). If paper uses a different income measure than `REALINC`, your estimates will diverge.

4) **Occupational prestige**
- **True:** “Occupational prestige”
- **Generated:** “Occupational prestige (PRESTG80)”
- If Bryson used a different prestige score or different treatment for nonworkers, this matters.

**Fix:** verify prestige variable and missing handling (e.g., exclude not-in-labor-force vs impute vs set missing).

5) **Hispanic**
- **True:** “Hispanic”
- **Generated:** “Hispanic (constructed from ETHNIC)”
- Bryson may use a race/ethnicity measure not identical to your construction.

**Fix:** match the paper’s “Hispanic” definition exactly (which GSS variables, which codes).

6) **Southern**
- **True:** “Southern”
- **Generated:** “Southern (REGION==3)”
- Depending on GSS coding, “South” may not be `3`, or Bryson may define South differently (e.g., including border states).

**Fix:** confirm REGION coding for 1993 and paper’s definition.

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (all variables, both models)

### 3.1 Model 1 coefficients + significance mismatches

DV: Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin Music

| Variable | True β (stars) | Generated β (stars) | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130\*\*** | **0.141758\*** | Effect size slightly off; **sig level wrong** (should be ** not *). Likely SE/p computed from wrong N/weights and/or wrong index. |
| Education | **-0.175\*\*\*** | **-0.257006\*\*\*** | Too negative (larger magnitude). Sample/coding mismatch. |
| Household income pc | -0.037 | -0.013842 | Too small magnitude (closer to 0). |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | 0.056543 | **Sign flips** (should be negative). |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.032617 | Too small magnitude. |
| Age | **0.163\*\*\*** | **0.176317\*\*** | Similar magnitude; **sig level wrong** (should be *** not **). |
| Black | **-0.132\*\*\*** | **-0.176370\*** | Too negative; **sig level wrong** (should be *** not *). |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | 0.012442 | **Sign flips** (should be negative). |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.011415 | Close, fine direction. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.121803 | Too large (likely wrong construction). |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN (dropped) | **Missing entirely** due to coding/sample. |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.057933 | **Sign flips** (should be positive). |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.566*** | Off (DV/sample mismatch). |
| R² / Adj R² / N | 0.145 / 0.129 / 644 | 0.178 / 0.142 / 261 | Off substantially. |

**Fixes (Model 1)**
- Reproduce N=644.
- Fix “No religion” coding so it varies and is included.
- Rebuild Conservative Protestant per paper.
- Recheck coding of Hispanic and Southern (your sign flips strongly suggest miscoding or wrong reference category).
- Ensure occupational prestige sign: likely your prestige variable or sample restrictions differ (e.g., only including employed respondents could change things; Bryson’s sample may differ).

### 3.2 Model 2 coefficients + significance mismatches

DV: Dislike of 12 Remaining Genres

| Variable | True β (stars) | Generated β (stars) | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.004597 | **Wrong sign and near zero** (major mismatch). |
| Education | **-0.242\*\*\*** | **-0.175550\*** | Too small magnitude; **stars wrong** (should be ***). |
| Household income pc | -0.065 | -0.069486 | Close. |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.083218 | Wrong sign and much larger magnitude. |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.089934 | Somewhat more negative. |
| Age | **0.126\*\*** | 0.124245 (no star) | Similar magnitude; **sig missing** (should be **). |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.044724 | Close. |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.008531 | Too small magnitude. |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.153495* | Too large; **stars wrong** (true table shows no stars). |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.139891* | Too large; likely wrong definition. |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN (dropped) | Missing entirely. |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.095778 | Somewhat larger. |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.293*** | Very different (DV construction likely wrong, also stars shouldn’t be invented if paper didn’t report). |
| R² / Adj R² / N | 0.147 / 0.130 / 605 | 0.159 / 0.121 / 259 | Off. |

**Fixes (Model 2)**
- Biggest red flag is **racism** going from +0.080 to ~0 and negative. That usually means:
  - racism index not constructed like Bryson’s, and/or
  - DV for “remaining 12 genres” not constructed like Bryson’s, and/or
  - sample is badly distorted (N=259 vs 605).
- Same categorical-variable fixes as Model 1.

---

## 4) “Standard errors” mismatch
- **True:** Table 2 reports **no standard errors**.
- **Generated:** You also report **no SEs**, only standardized betas and stars. So there is **no SE mismatch** to list.

**But there is an interpretation/reporting discrepancy:** your stars are based on *your* computed p-values, not the paper’s stars.

**Fix**
- Once you replicate the sample/coding, recompute p-values/stars.
- Alternatively, if your goal is to reproduce the table exactly, **hard-code the paper’s stars** after matching the coefficients (less ideal, but sometimes used in replication tables).

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches

### 5.1 You implicitly interpret “No religion” as removed for “no variation”
- **True:** It varies and is substantively estimated.
- **Generated:** Dropped.

**Fix:** correct religion coding and avoid sample restrictions that eliminate “none.”

### 5.2 You label Conservative Protestant as a “proxy”
- **True:** It’s a defined category in the paper; using a proxy changes interpretation and comparability.

**Fix:** match the paper’s definition; otherwise state clearly the model is **not a replication**.

### 5.3 Potential DV range/scale mismatch (strongly suggested by constants)
- **True constants:** 2.415 (Model 1), 7.860 (Model 2). Your Model 2 intercept (5.293) is far lower.
- That suggests your DV2 may have a different mean/scale than Bryson’s.

**Fix:** reconstruct both DVs exactly:
- same set of genres in each DV,
- same dislike coding (what counts as “dislike”),
- same handling of neutral/missing responses,
- same summing vs averaging,
- confirm max values (your descriptives show max 6 and 12, which matches, but the mean/intercept mismatch suggests coding differences remain).

---

## 6) Minimal checklist to make Generated match True

1) **Match dataset/year and weighting** exactly as Bryson (1996).
2) **Rebuild racism score** exactly per paper (items + scaling).
3) **Rebuild DVs** exactly per paper (genre list + dislike threshold + missing handling).
4) **Fix religion variables**:
   - correct “no religion” coding,
   - correct Conservative Protestant classification.
5) **Fix region and ethnicity coding** (verify South and Hispanic definitions).
6) Re-run standardized OLS on the correct analytic samples until you get:
   - N=644 and N=605
   - R² ≈ .145 and .147
   - then check coefficients/stars.

If you paste your code (or at least the variable construction steps for: racism_score, both DVs, no_religion, cons_prot, south, hispanic, and sample filters), I can point to the exact lines causing each mismatch and give corrected code.
