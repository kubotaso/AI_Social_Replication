Score: 12/100
============================================================

## 1) Scope/definition mismatches (make the models comparable first)

### A. Sample size (N) is wrong in both generated models
- **Generated:** N = 283 for Model A and Model B.
- **True (paper):** N = 644 (Model 1) and N = 605 (Model 2).
- **Fix:** Replicate the paper’s **GSS 1993** sample and the paper’s **listwise deletion rules** (or whatever missing-data handling Bryson used). Your current data pipeline is dropping far more cases (likely due to constructing DVs/IVs from variables that are missing for many respondents, or filtering to a subset).

### B. Dependent variables don’t match the paper’s DVs (likely)
- **Generated DV names:** `dislike_minority_genres` and `dislike_other12_genres` with “Table2_ModelA_dislike_minority6” and “ModelB_dislike_other12”.
- **True DV definitions:**
  - Model 1: *# disliked among rap, reggae, blues/R&B, jazz, gospel, latin* (6 genres)
  - Model 2: *# disliked among remaining 12 genres*
- **Fix:** Ensure the DV construction exactly matches the paper:
  - Same set of genres.
  - Same coding of “dislike” (e.g., dislikes vs neutral vs likes; Bryson’s coding threshold matters).
  - Same handling of “don’t know / inapplicable” responses.

### C. “No religion” is incorrectly dropped
- **Generated:** `No religion = NaN` and flagged as `dropped_zero_variance_predictors no_religion`.
- **True:** “No religion” is included in both models (0.057 in Model 1; 0.024 in Model 2).
- **Fix:** You have a construction error:
  - You likely filtered to only respondents with religion, or recoded “no religion” into missing, or created a dummy that becomes constant after subsetting.
  - Rebuild religion categories so “No religion” has variation and a valid reference group (e.g., mainline Protestant / Catholic / etc., consistent with Bryson).

## 2) Variable-name alignment (labels vs actual predictors)

The *names* mostly align conceptually, but you must ensure the **coding matches** Bryson’s:

- **Race dummies:** Black / Hispanic / Other race must use the same baseline (almost certainly **White**).
- **Female:** confirm coding (1=female) and baseline (male).
- **Southern:** confirm definition (Census South?) and coding.
- **Education, age, income, prestige:** ensure same scale and any transformations (e.g., income per capita construction).

If any of these are coded differently, standardized coefficients can flip or shrink/grow.

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas + significance)

Below I compare the paper’s **standardized coefficients** to your generated `paper_style` standardized betas.

### Model 1 (paper) vs Generated ModelA_paper_style

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130** (**) | 0.106 | Too small; stars missing |
| Education | **-0.175** (***) | -0.226 (**) | Magnitude too large; significance level off |
| HH income per capita | -0.037 | -0.006 | Way too small (near 0) |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | +0.082 | **Sign flip** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.016 | Too small |
| Age | **0.163** (***) | +0.074 | Too small; stars missing |
| Black | **-0.132** (***) | -0.189 (**) | Too large; sig level off |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.026 | Too small |
| Other race | -0.017 | +0.003 | Wrong sign, near 0 |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.063 | +0.075 | Close-ish |
| No religion | +0.057 | NaN (dropped) | **Omitted** |
| Southern | +0.024 | +0.020 | Close-ish |
| Constant | 2.415 (***) | 2.530 (***) | Different (expected if sample/DV differs) |

**Key qualitative interpretation errors implied by these mismatches:**
- Your Model A would wrongly suggest **occupational prestige increases dislike** (positive), while the paper reports a small **negative** effect.
- You understate the role of **age** and **racism score** compared with the paper.
- You cannot reproduce the paper’s significance pattern (age and racism should be significant; yours are not).

**Fixes:**
1. Correct DV construction + restore N≈644.
2. Fix “No religion” coding (include it).
3. Verify prestige measure and direction (higher prestige should correspond to the paper’s coding; you may have reversed it or used a different prestige variable).
4. Ensure “racism score” is built from the same items and scaling as Bryson.

### Model 2 (paper) vs Generated ModelB_paper_style

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | +0.080 | **-0.045** | **Sign flip** |
| Education | -0.242 (***) | -0.242 (***) | Matches well |
| HH income per capita | -0.065 | -0.043 | Somewhat smaller |
| Occupational prestige | +0.005 | **-0.043** | Wrong sign (and too large) |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.060 | Close-ish |
| Age | +0.126 (**) | +0.031 | Far too small; missing significance |
| Black | +0.042 | -0.040 | Wrong sign |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.054 | Too negative |
| Other race | +0.047 | +0.064 | A bit larger |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.048 | +0.169 (**) | Much too large and wrongly significant |
| No religion | +0.024 | NaN (dropped) | **Omitted** |
| Southern | +0.069 | +0.119 (*) | Too large |
| Constant | 7.860 | 6.095 (***) | Quite different |

**Interpretation consequences:**
- Your results imply racism *reduces* disliking the “other 12 genres,” whereas the paper’s estimate is **positive** (though not significant).
- You make **Conservative Protestantism** a major positive predictor; the paper finds a small, non-significant coefficient.

**Fixes:**
1. Same as Model 1: correct sample/DV → N≈605, and restore “No religion.”
2. Rebuild “racism score” (a sign flip is a huge red flag for reversed coding or using different items).
3. Re-check race coding (Black sign mismatch suggests baseline/coding differences or sample differences).

## 4) Standard errors: generated SEs exist but “true SEs” do not

### Discrepancy
- **Generated:** You report unstandardized coefficients + standard errors from a “full reestimation.”
- **True:** Table 2 **does not provide SEs** at all (only standardized betas + stars).

### Why this matters
You **cannot** claim your SEs “match Table 2” because there are no SEs to compare. Also, your star annotations appear derived from your reestimated p-values, but the paper’s stars come from *their* model on *their* sample with *their* coding.

### Fix
- If you want comparability with Table 2, report **only standardized coefficients and stars**, and base stars on the replicated model using the correct N/coding.
- If you keep SEs, explicitly label them as “SEs from replication (not in published Table 2).”

## 5) Fit statistics mismatches (R² / adj. R²)

- **Generated:**
  - Model A: R² = 0.1219; adj R² = 0.0863
  - Model B: R² = 0.1333; adj R² = 0.0982
- **True:**
  - Model 1: R² = 0.145; adj R² = 0.129
  - Model 2: R² = 0.147; adj R² = 0.130

**Fix:** Once the DV definitions, predictors, and sample match, R² should move toward the published values. Your low adj. R² is consistent with your much smaller N and/or a noisier/misconstructed DV.

## 6) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Use GSS 1993** and reproduce Bryson’s analytic sample.
2. **Recreate the two DVs exactly** (the same 6 “minority-liked” genres and the “remaining 12”; same dislike coding; same missing handling).
3. **Rebuild “racism score”** to match item set, direction, and scaling (make sure higher = more racist, as in the paper).
4. **Recode religion** so that:
   - “Conservative Protestant” is a dummy consistent with Bryson’s classification,
   - “No religion” is a valid dummy and not collapsed into missing,
   - a sensible omitted category is used (likely everyone else).
5. **Verify prestige and income-per-capita** are the same measures and oriented correctly.
6. **Confirm dummy baselines** (White, Male, non-South, non–conservative Protestant, etc.).
7. **Report standardized coefficients** (and stars) for the replicated models; don’t present SE “comparisons” to Table 2.

If you share your variable construction code (especially for the racism scale, the two DV counts, and religion), I can pinpoint which recode is causing the sign flips and the “no religion” drop.
