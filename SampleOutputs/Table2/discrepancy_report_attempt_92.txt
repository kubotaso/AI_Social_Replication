### 1) Fundamental reporting mismatch: SEs / p-values / stars are not recoverable from Table 2
**Mismatch**
- **Generated** tables report **unstandardized coefficients (`b_unstd`)**, **p-values**, and significance **stars** as if they came from the paper.
- **True** Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients only** (plus significance markers). It **does not report standard errors** (and therefore no p-values can be “extracted” from it).

**How to fix**
- If your goal is to match **Table 2 exactly**, you must:
  - **Drop** `b_unstd`, `p_value`, and any SE-based inference output.
  - Keep only: `term`, `beta` (standardized coefficient), and `stars` consistent with the table’s markers.
- If your goal is to reproduce the study from raw GSS data, you *can* compute SEs/p-values—but then you must state clearly: “SEs/p-values are computed from the replication dataset, not reported in Table 2,” and you still must match the paper’s coding/sample/weights to align.

### 2) Sample size and fit statistics do not match (big discrepancies)
#### Model 1 (paper) vs ModelA (generated)
**Mismatch**
- **True N = 644**, **R² = .145**, **Adj R² = .129**
- **Generated N = 327**, **R² = .1896**, **Adj R² = .1639**

#### Model 2 (paper) vs ModelB (generated)
**Mismatch**
- **True N = 605**, **R² = .147**, **Adj R² = .130**
- **Generated N = 308**, **R² = .1658**, **Adj R² = .1377**

**How to fix**
This indicates your replication is using a **different analytic sample** (roughly half the size), almost certainly due to one or more of:
- Listwise deletion from variables that are missing more than in the paper
- Wrong year(s): paper is **GSS 1993**
- Wrong DV construction (not using the same set of genres or missing rules)
- Wrong handling of “don’t know / not asked / inapplicable”
- Possible use of a subset (e.g., only one split-ballot form)

Concrete fixes to align with Table 2:
1. Restrict to **GSS 1993** only.
2. Recreate the two DVs exactly as Bryson defines them (counts of disliked genres in each set).
3. Use the paper’s missing-data rules (often: exclude cases missing on any RHS, but ensure you’re not accidentally excluding half the sample via DV construction).
4. Ensure your variable harmonization matches the GSS coding for race/ethnicity, religion, etc.
5. Apply any weighting if the paper did (Bryson often uses GSS weight; confirm in methods).

### 3) Variable name mismatches / missing predictors
#### “Hispanic” is missing in generated output
**Mismatch**
- **True table includes Hispanic** in both models.
- **Generated** includes `other_race` and `black` but **no `hispanic` term**.

**How to fix**
- Add a `hispanic` dummy (or the same ethnicity coding as the paper) and ensure the reference category matches (typically White non-Hispanic as reference, with Black/Hispanic/Other race dummies).

#### “No religion” is incorrectly omitted in generated output
**Mismatch**
- **True**: “No religion” has coefficients in both models (**0.057** in Model 1; **0.024** in Model 2).
- **Generated**: `no_religion` is **NaN / omitted** in both models.

**How to fix**
- This is almost always a **collinearity / reference-category coding error**.
  - You likely created a religion factor and included all levels + intercept (dummy trap), or you set “no religion” as the reference but still expect a coefficient.
- Fix by choosing a clear base category (e.g., “mainline Protestant/other Christian/etc.”) and include:
  - `cons_protestant` dummy
  - `no_religion` dummy
  - (and omit the base category)
- Verify in your design matrix that `no_religion` actually varies and is not identical to another column.

### 4) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas): Model 1 (paper) vs ModelA (generated)

Below I compare the **standardized coefficients** only (because that’s what Table 2 reports).  

**Racism score**
- Generated: **0.1395** with `*`
- True: **0.130** with `**`
- **Mismatch**: magnitude slightly off; significance marker differs.
- **Fix**: sample/coding/weights; also stars shouldn’t be derived from your p-values if you’re trying to match Table 2.

**Education**
- Generated: **-0.2609**
- True: **-0.175**
- **Mismatch**: too negative in generated.
- **Fix**: likely education coding differs (years vs degree categories), or sample differs.

**Household income per capita**
- Generated: **-0.0345**
- True: **-0.037**
- **Close** (minor difference likely sample/weighting).

**Occupational prestige**
- Generated: **+0.0303**
- True: **-0.020**
- **Mismatch in sign**.
- **Fix**: wrong prestige variable or reverse-coded scale, or different occupational prestige measure than Bryson used.

**Female**
- Generated: **-0.0258**
- True: **-0.057**
- **Mismatch** (weaker effect in generated).
- **Fix**: sample/coding.

**Age**
- Generated: **0.1912**
- True: **0.163**
- **Mismatch** (generated higher).

**Black**
- Generated: **-0.1272**
- True: **-0.132**
- **Close**, but note significance differs: paper has `***`, generated has `*` (again: star logic mismatch).

**Other race**
- Generated: **+0.0037**
- True: **-0.017**
- **Mismatch** (small, but sign differs).

**Conservative Protestant**
- Generated: **0.0791**
- True: **0.063**
- **Mismatch** (moderate).

**No religion**
- Generated: omitted
- True: **0.057**
- **Mismatch** (missing term).

**Southern**
- Generated: **0.0219**
- True: **0.024**
- **Close**.

**Constant**
- Generated `beta` is NaN (fine—constants aren’t standardized), but unstd constant differs: **2.654** vs **2.415**.
- **Mismatch**, but constants won’t match unless DV coding and sample match perfectly.

---

### 5) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas): Model 2 (paper) vs ModelB (generated)

**Racism score**
- Generated: **-0.0051**
- True: **+0.080**
- **Major mismatch in sign and magnitude.**
- **Fix**: DV likely constructed incorrectly for Model 2 (wrong set of “remaining 12 genres”), racism scale coding may be reversed, or sample restrictions differ.

**Education**
- Generated: **-0.2238**
- True: **-0.242**
- **Somewhat close**.

**Household income per capita**
- Generated: **-0.0954**
- True: **-0.065**
- **Mismatch** (too negative).

**Occupational prestige**
- Generated: **-0.0123**
- True: **+0.005**
- **Mismatch in sign** (again suggests prestige measure/coding problem).

**Female**
- Generated: **-0.0912**
- True: **-0.070**
- **Mismatch** (stronger in generated).

**Age**
- Generated: **0.0914**
- True: **0.126**
- **Mismatch** (weaker in generated), and the paper shows **significant** (`**`) while generated shows not significant—again, inference mismatch + sample differences.

**Black**
- Generated: **0.1122**
- True: **0.042**
- **Mismatch** (too large).

**Other race**
- Generated: **0.1321** with `*`
- True: **0.047**
- **Mismatch** (too large).

**Hispanic**
- Generated: missing
- True: **-0.029**
- **Mismatch** (missing term).

**Conservative Protestant**
- Generated: **0.0803**
- True: **0.048**
- **Mismatch**.

**No religion**
- Generated: omitted
- True: **0.024**
- **Mismatch**.

**Southern**
- Generated: **0.1424** with `**`
- True: **0.069**
- **Mismatch** (about double).

**Constant**
- Generated unstd constant: **5.674**
- True constant: **7.860**
- **Mismatch**, again driven by DV coding and sample.

### 6) Interpretation mismatch: what the models are supposed to be
**Mismatch**
- Your model labels `dislike_minority6` and `dislike_other12` suggest the right idea, but the coefficient patterns (especially racism in Model 2 and prestige sign flips) strongly indicate the **constructed DVs and/or predictors don’t match the paper’s operationalization**.

**How to fix (most important steps)**
1. **Rebuild the two dependent variables** to match Bryson:
   - Model 1 DV: count of dislikes for **Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin**.
   - Model 2 DV: count of dislikes for the **other 12** genres (make sure you have the *exact* 18 genre list and that the complement set is correct).
   - Confirm whether “dislike” is defined as a particular response category (e.g., “dislike” vs “like” vs “neutral”), and how missing/DK are treated.
2. **Recode race/ethnicity** to include **Black, Hispanic, Other race** (with White as reference).
3. **Fix religion dummies** so `no_religion` is not omitted.
4. **Use the same year and weighting scheme** (GSS 1993; check paper for weight).
5. After the above, re-estimate and then **report only standardized coefficients** and Bryson’s significance markers if your aim is to match Table 2 presentation.

---

### 7) What to change in the generated output format to “match the paper”
To match Table 2, your output should look like:

- A table with variables named like the paper (“Racism score”, “Education”, “Household income per capita”, etc.)
- One column of standardized coefficients, plus stars
- N, R², Adj R² matching (644/.145/.129 and 605/.147/.130)

And you should remove:
- `b_unstd`
- any SEs and p-values (unless explicitly labeled as replication-computed and not from the PDF)

---

If you share (a) your exact variable construction code for the two DVs and (b) how you coded prestige, race/ethnicity, religion, and weights, I can pinpoint which specific coding choice is producing the N-halving and the sign flip for racism in Model 2.
