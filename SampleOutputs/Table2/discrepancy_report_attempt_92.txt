Score: 20/100
============================================================

Below are **all mismatches** between the Generated Results and the True Results (Bryson 1996 Table 2), grouped by **(A) variable names/model setup**, **(B) coefficients & significance**, **(C) fit statistics / N**, and **(D) interpretation/reporting**—with **specific fixes** to make the generated analysis match the published table.

---

## A) Variable names / model setup mismatches

### A1) “Model1_Coefficient / Std_Beta” vs what Table 2 contains
- **True**: Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas).
- **Generated**: Calls them `Model1_Coefficient` / `Std_Beta` but also labels the constant “intercept (unstandardized)”, mixing standardized and unstandardized language.

**Fix**
- Explicitly label the column as **Standardized coefficient (β)** (not “Coefficient” if that might imply unstandardized b).
- Keep “Constant” as an **unstandardized intercept** (that’s fine), but do **not** call the other coefficients “unstandardized”.

### A2) DV names match conceptually, but the “count of 6/12” phrasing is not identical to the paper
- **True DV wording**:
  - Model 1: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”
  - Model 2: “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”
- **Generated DV wording** adds “(count of 6)” and “(count of 12)”. That may be correct substantively, but it is **not exactly Table 2’s wording**.

**Fix**
- Use Table 2 wording verbatim in the reporting table titles/headers.

### A3) Variable names: mostly match, but you must match *exact* model coding/baselines
Even if names look the same (Black/Hispanic/Other race; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern), your results indicate you may be using:
- different reference categories,
- different sample restrictions,
- different construction of DVs and/or racism scale.

**Fix**
- Replicate the paper’s coding exactly (race dummies vs white; religion categories; region; etc.). This is not just cosmetic—your coefficients show the coding/sample is not aligned (see sections B & C).

---

## B) Coefficient + significance mismatches (every variable)

### Model 1 (Minority-linked genres: 6)

For each row: **Generated β (sig)** vs **True β (sig)**

1) **Racism score**
- Generated: **0.134248 (**)**  
- True: **0.130 (**)**  
- Mismatch: small numeric difference.

Fix: match sample/coding/standardization (see Section C); rounding alone won’t explain all other gaps.

2) **Education**
- Generated: **-0.205569 (***)**  
- True: **-0.175 (***)**  
- Mismatch: too negative.

Fix: replicate education coding and standardization, and correct analytic N (you have 438 vs 644).

3) **Household income per capita**
- Generated: **+0.032927 (ns)**  
- True: **-0.037 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: **sign flips**.

Fix: income variable construction/transform is not the same (and/or missing-data handling differs). Ensure:
- same definition of “income per capita,”
- same treatment of top-coding,
- same standardization procedure,
- same sample.

4) **Occupational prestige**
- Generated: **+0.010445 (ns)**  
- True: **-0.020 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: sign flips (small magnitude but opposite direction).

Fix: prestige scale likely different (or sample). Use the same prestige measure as paper.

5) **Female**
- Generated: **-0.076018 (ns)**  
- True: **-0.057 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: more negative.

Fix: sample/coding differences.

6) **Age**
- Generated: **0.144134 (**)**  
- True: **0.163 (***)**  
- Mismatch: size and **significance level** (you have **, paper has ***).

Fix: correct sample size and standard errors/significance computation to match Table 2 (your p-stars are inconsistent with Table 2’s).

7) **Black**
- Generated: **-0.080088 (ns)**  
- True: **-0.132 (***)**  
- Mismatch: much smaller magnitude and **missing significance**.

Fix: race coding, weighting, and especially sample (your N is far smaller).

8) **Hispanic**
- Generated: **-0.114933 (*)**  
- True: **-0.058 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: about double magnitude and **significance differs**.

Fix: Hispanic identification/coding differs OR sample differs; also your star thresholds may not match the paper’s two-tailed tests.

9) **Other race**
- Generated: **+0.002408 (ns)**  
- True: **-0.017 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: sign flips (minor).

Fix: race coding and sample.

10) **Conservative Protestant**
- Generated: **0.088535 (ns)**  
- True: **0.063 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: moderate difference.

Fix: religious tradition classification differs (e.g., definition of “Conservative Protestant”).

11) **No religion**
- Generated: **0.066612 (ns)**  
- True: **0.057 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: small difference.

Fix: minor; still likely sample/coding.

12) **Southern**
- Generated: **-0.021084 (ns)**  
- True: **+0.024 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: **sign flips**.

Fix: region coding (South definition) and sample.

13) **Constant**
- Generated: **2.559982 (***)**  
- True: **2.415 (***)**  
- Mismatch: intercept differs.

Fix: intercept will change with sample and DV scaling; match DV construction and N.

---

### Model 2 (Remaining 12 genres)

1) **Racism score**
- Generated: **-0.039158 (ns)**  
- True: **+0.080 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: **sign flips** and magnitude differs.

Fix: racism scale direction and/or DV construction differs. Confirm:
- higher racism score = more racist (same direction as paper),
- DV “dislike” coded same way,
- same sample/weights.

2) **Education**
- Generated: **-0.217085 (***)**  
- True: **-0.242 (***)**  
- Mismatch: too small in magnitude.

Fix: sample/coding; also N differs (406 vs 605).

3) **Household income per capita**
- Generated: **-0.030683 (ns)**  
- True: **-0.065 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: too small in magnitude.

Fix: income construction and sample.

4) **Occupational prestige**
- Generated: **-0.028849 (ns)**  
- True: **+0.005 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: sign flips.

Fix: prestige measure mismatch and/or sample.

5) **Female**
- Generated: **-0.075616 (ns)**  
- True: **-0.070 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: tiny (basically rounding-level).

Fix: likely resolved once sample matches.

6) **Age**
- Generated: **0.111582 (*)**  
- True: **0.126 (**)**  
- Mismatch: smaller magnitude and **wrong significance level**.

Fix: match N and match star assignment to paper’s (two-tailed) thresholds using the paper’s SEs/t-stats (or recompute with same design/weights).

7) **Black**
- Generated: **0.074257 (ns)**  
- True: **0.042 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: somewhat larger.

Fix: race coding/sample.

8) **Hispanic**
- Generated: **0.001474 (ns)**  
- True: **-0.029 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: sign and magnitude.

Fix: coding/sample.

9) **Other race**
- Generated: **0.077600 (ns)**  
- True: **0.047 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: larger.

Fix: coding/sample.

10) **Conservative Protestant**
- Generated: **0.117186 (*)**  
- True: **0.048 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: much larger and **incorrectly significant**.

Fix: religious tradition coding/definition and star computation; sample mismatch.

11) **No religion**
- Generated: **0.016051 (ns)**  
- True: **0.024 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: small.

Fix: sample.

12) **Southern**
- Generated: **0.079182 (ns)**  
- True: **0.069 (ns)**  
- Mismatch: small.

Fix: sample.

13) **Constant**
- Generated: **5.478936 (***)**  
- True: **7.860 (no stars shown in table)**  
- Mismatch: large intercept difference and significance reporting differs.

Fix:
- Intercept depends on DV scaling and sample; you’re not using the same DV and/or sample.
- Also: Table 2 prints “7.860” with no significance marker; don’t force stars onto the constant unless the table does.

---

## C) Standard errors and fit statistics mismatches

### C1) Standard errors: you report none (but your prompt asks to compare SEs)
- **True**: Table 2 **does not report SEs**.
- **Generated**: also does not report SEs, but it *does* report significance stars.

**Mismatch (interpretive/reporting)**: You cannot validate SE mismatches because the true table has none.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to match Table 2: **do not add SEs**; only show betas + stars exactly as printed.
- If you *must* compute SEs, you need the original data and model spec and then note: “SEs not reported in Bryson (1996).”

### C2) R² and Adjusted R² do not match
- Model 1:
  - Generated R²: **0.1210**, Adj R²: **0.0962**
  - True R²: **0.145**, Adj R²: **0.129**
- Model 2:
  - Generated R²: **0.1299**, Adj R²: **0.1033**
  - True R²: **0.147**, Adj R²: **0.130**

**Fix**
- This is a strong signal you are **not reproducing the same model** (different N, different variable construction, missing weights, etc.). To match:
  1) Use the **same analytic sample sizes** (below),
  2) Use **same weighting/design** (likely GSS weights),
  3) Use the **same DV construction** and standardization approach.

### C3) N is drastically wrong
- Model 1:
  - Generated N: **438**
  - True N: **644**
- Model 2:
  - Generated N: **406**
  - True N: **605**

**Fix**
- Your data filtering/missingness handling is not aligned with the paper. To match:
  - Use the same survey year(s)/wave(s) and inclusion criteria as Bryson.
  - Recreate the DVs from the same set of genre items and the same “dislike” rule.
  - Handle missing values the same way (Bryson likely used listwise deletion but on a different missingness pattern than yours; or you are accidentally dropping extra cases via merges/recodes).
  - Apply weights if the paper did.

---

## D) Interpretation / reporting mismatches

### D1) Racism effect in Model 2 is wrong in direction
- **True**: racism is **positive** (0.080) for dislike of remaining genres (though not significant).
- **Generated**: racism is **negative** (-0.039).

**Fix**
- Verify direction of:
  - racism scale (reverse-coded?),
  - DV “dislike” (is higher = more dislike?),
  - any reverse-scoring of genre items.

### D2) Southern sign in Model 1 is wrong
- **True**: Southern is **positive** (0.024).
- **Generated**: negative (-0.021).

**Fix**
- Ensure “Southern” dummy uses same region definition (US Census South?) and correct coding (1=south).

### D3) Star assignment is inconsistent with Table 2
Examples:
- Model 1 Age: Generated **, True ***
- Model 1 Hispanic: Generated *, True none
- Model 2 Conservative Protestant: Generated *, True none

**Fix**
- If matching Table 2: **use the stars exactly as printed**, not computed from your regression.
- If recomputing: you must match the paper’s:
  - sample (N),
  - weights,
  - test type (two-tailed; already stated),
  - and possibly robust vs conventional SEs.

### D4) Constant in Model 2: significance and value do not match
- **True**: constant = 7.860 (no stars shown)
- **Generated**: 5.478936***

**Fix**
- Match DV scaling and sample; and don’t print stars for the constant unless Table 2 prints them.

---

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches Table 2 (action checklist)

1) **Use the correct N** (Model1=644, Model2=605).  
   - Rebuild analytic sample selection to replicate Bryson’s.

2) **Reconstruct the DVs exactly** as Bryson did.  
   - Same genres in each DV, same “dislike” coding rule, same handling of missing genre responses.

3) **Verify directionality** for:
   - racism scale (higher = more racist),
   - dislike counts (higher = more dislikes).

4) **Match covariate coding**:
   - education measure,
   - income per capita definition,
   - occupational prestige scale,
   - race dummies and reference category,
   - Conservative Protestant and No religion classification,
   - Southern definition.

5) **Apply the same weighting/estimation choices** as the original analysis (if any).  
   - This often changes betas, R², and significance.

6) **Report exactly what Table 2 reports**:
   - standardized betas + stars,
   - constants as shown,
   - R² / Adj R²,
   - N,
   - **no SEs**.

If you tell me (or paste) the code/data steps that produced your “Generated Results” (especially how you built the two DVs and handled missingness/weights), I can point to the *specific* step(s) that are causing the N collapse and the sign flips.
