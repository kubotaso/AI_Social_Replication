============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from the **True Results (Bryson 1996 Table 2)**, covering **variable names/order, coefficients, SEs/p-values, fit statistics, and interpretation/significance**—and what you must change so the generated output matches the published table.

---

## 1) Fundamental reporting mismatch: SEs and p-values should not be reported

### Mismatch
- Your generated output includes:
  - `ModelA_full` / `ModelB_full` with **unstandardized b, standard errors, t, p_value**
  - `ModelA_betas` / `ModelB_betas` with **p_values** for standardized betas
  - star annotations based on those p-values
- But the true Table 2 **does not report standard errors or p-values**. It reports **standardized coefficients only**, with significance markers.

### How to fix
- If your goal is “match the paper table,” your output should be limited to:
  - standardized coefficients (β) and stars, **no SE columns**, no p-values, no t-stats.
- If you *do* compute p-values from the microdata, that becomes a *replication*, not an extraction from Table 2—then you must label it as such and accept it may not match the printed stars due to weights, sample restrictions, coding differences, etc.

---

## 2) Sample size mismatch (N) — large discrepancy

### Mismatch
True:
- Model 1: **N = 644**
- Model 2: **N = 605**

Generated (`fit` table):
- ModelA: **n = 259**
- ModelB: **n = 255**

### How to fix
This is not a small rounding issue; it indicates you are not using the same analytic sample. To align:
- Use **GSS 1993** data (as in the title).
- Apply the same inclusion rules Bryson used (likely valid responses on DV + key predictors).
- Ensure you are not inadvertently:
  - limiting to a subpopulation,
  - dropping cases due to missingness in variables that Bryson didn’t include (or coded differently),
  - using a dataset with only a subset of GSS,
  - filtering on race/religion, etc.
- Confirm the DV construction uses the correct set of genres and coding (see Section 6).

---

## 3) Fit statistics mismatch: R² and adjusted R² do not match

### Mismatch
True:
- Model 1: **R² = .145**, **Adj R² = .129**
- Model 2: **R² = .147**, **Adj R² = .130**

Generated:
- ModelA: **R² = 0.141**, **Adj R² = 0.103** (adj R² far too low)
- ModelB: **R² = 0.182**, **Adj R² = 0.145** (too high)

### How to fix
Once you fix **sample size** and **variable construction**, R² should move. Additionally:
- Verify you are using the same estimator assumptions (OLS, same covariates).
- Check whether Bryson used **weights** (GSS often requires weights). If the paper used weights and you did not (or vice versa), coefficients and fit can differ.
- Ensure all predictors match the table definitions (dummy coding, reference groups).

## 4) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas): Model 1 (your ModelA)

Below I compare True Model 1 coefficients to your `ModelA_table2style` / `ModelA_betas` (std_beta).

### Model 1: True vs Generated (β)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130** | **0.138** | close numerically, but star level differs (see below) |
| Education | **-0.175** | **-0.223** | too negative |
| Household income per capita | **-0.037** | **0.016** | wrong sign |
| Occupational prestige | **-0.020** | **0.043** | wrong sign |
| Female | **-0.057** | **-0.016** | magnitude too small |
| Age | **0.163** | **0.083** | about half as large |
| Black | **-0.132** | **-0.208** | too negative |
| Hispanic | **-0.058** | **0.014** | wrong sign |
| Other race | **-0.017** | **0.005** | wrong sign |
| Conservative Protestant | **0.063** | **0.088** | somewhat higher |
| No religion | **0.057** | **NaN (dropped)** | variable missing/collinear in your model |
| Southern | **0.024** | **0.001** | far smaller |
| Constant | **2.415** | **2.577** | differs (and your constant is from unstandardized model output, not the printed table) |

### How to fix Model 1 mismatches
These patterns (many sign flips and big magnitude shifts) usually come from **variable coding / DV construction / sample restriction**, not random noise.

Concretely check and correct:

1. **DV definition**:  
   True Model 1 DV = “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” (sum/count of disliked genres).  
   - Ensure you used exactly those 6 genres.
   - Ensure “dislike” is coded the same way as Bryson (e.g., “dislike” vs “strongly dislike,” handling “neutral,” “don’t know,” etc.).
   - Ensure the DV is a **count of disliked genres** in that set, matching Bryson’s “number of genres disliked.”

2. **Income per capita**:  
   Your generated unstandardized income coefficient is essentially zero (`b=0.000002`), suggesting scaling problems.
   - Make sure “household income per capita” is constructed correctly (household income divided by household size) and scaled similarly to Bryson (he may use logged income, or a particular GSS income measure).
   - If you accidentally used raw dollars with huge variance, standardization can still work—but sign flips often indicate you used a different concept (e.g., respondent income instead of household per-capita).

3. **Race dummies**:  
   Sign flips for Hispanic/Other suggest dummy coding/reference category problems.
   - Verify reference category is **White** and you have dummies for **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race**.
   - Do not inadvertently include “white” as a dummy too (dummy trap) or mis-map race categories.

4. **Religion variables**: `No religion` is NaN in your results.
   - In your diagnostics, `no_religion_mean = 0.0` and `no_religion_sd = 0.0` for both models. That means the variable is **constant (all zeros)** in your analytic data—so it cannot be estimated.
   - Fix: construct “No religion” correctly from GSS religion variables; ensure the category actually exists in your sample; do not filter it away.

5. **South**: Your South effect is near zero vs true 0.024.
   - Likely region coding mismatch (e.g., using “born in south” vs “lives in south”, or wrong region definition).

---

## 5) Coefficient mismatches: Model 2 (your ModelB)

### Model 2: True vs Generated (β)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Issue |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | **-0.008** | wrong sign, near zero |
| Education | -0.242 | **-0.249** | close |
| Household income per capita | -0.065 | **-0.065** | matches well |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | **-0.093** | wrong sign, much larger magnitude |
| Female | -0.070 | **-0.076** | close |
| Age | 0.126 | **-0.015** | wrong sign |
| Black | 0.042 | **0.024** | smaller |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **0.008** | wrong sign |
| Other race | 0.047 | **0.116** | too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | **0.150** | too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | **NaN (dropped)** | same construction failure as Model 1 |
| Southern | 0.069 | **0.163** | too large |
| Constant | 7.860 | **6.727** | differs substantially |

### How to fix Model 2 mismatches
- Again, the biggest red flags are:
  - **Racism sign flip** (0.080 true vs -0.008 generated)
  - **Age sign flip** (0.126 true vs -0.015 generated)
  - **Occ prestige sign flip** (0.005 true vs -0.093 generated)
  - **No religion missing (NaN)**
These strongly suggest you are **not reproducing Bryson’s variable coding and/or sample**, and possibly not even the same DV.

Fixes:
1. **Confirm DV is “12 remaining genres”** (and excludes the 6 genres from Model 1). Any overlap or mis-specified genre list will change signs/associations.
2. **Rebuild age** (in years) and check it isn’t reversed or centered oddly.
3. **Rebuild occupational prestige** using the correct GSS prestige score variable (and ensure higher = more prestige).
4. **Rebuild racism score** to match Bryson’s index. A different racism scale (or reverse-coded) easily yields sign changes.

## 6) Variable name/order alignment problems: your tables are unlabeled

### Mismatch
Your `ModelA_table2style` and `ModelB_table2style` show only rows of numbers—no variable names. That makes it impossible to guarantee the ordering matches the paper.

Also, your outputs include two `NaN` rows before the constant in the “table2style” outputs—suggesting:
- a variable is included but not estimated (perfect collinearity),
- or you inserted spacer rows incorrectly.

### How to fix
- Print a coefficient table with an explicit **row label for each predictor** in the exact order used in the paper:
  1) Racism score  
  2) Education  
  3) Household income per capita  
  4) Occupational prestige  
  5) Female  
  6) Age  
  7) Black  
  8) Hispanic  
  9) Other race  
  10) Conservative Protestant  
  11) No religion  
  12) Southern  
  13) Constant
- Remove any placeholder rows; ensure every listed variable is estimated.

---

## 7) Significance marker mismatches (stars)

### Mismatch
Even where coefficients are close, your stars often don’t match the paper because:
- You compute stars from your p-values (which are based on your different N, coding, etc.).
- The paper’s stars correspond to its own estimation setup.

Examples:
- True Model 1: Racism **0.130** with ** (p<.01). Generated: 0.138* (only p<.05).
- True Model 1: Black is ***; Generated: Black has p=0.106 (no stars).

### How to fix (depending on goal)
- **To match the published table**: hard-code the stars exactly as printed for those coefficients (since Table 2 is only standardized betas + stars).
- **To genuinely replicate**: fix sample/coding/weights; then recompute p-values and stars. Don’t expect an exact match unless all details match.

---

## 8) Constant mismatch and interpretation

### Mismatch
True constants:
- Model 1 constant: **2.415***  
- Model 2 constant: **7.860** (no stars shown in your excerpt; in many tables constants are not starred even if significant)

Generated constants:
- ModelA constant: **2.577***  
- ModelB constant: **6.727***  

Also: your “standardized table” is mixing standardized betas with an **unstandardized constant**, which is fine descriptively, but you must match the paper’s displayed constant values.

### How to fix
- Use the same DV scale and sample; constants will adjust automatically.
- Ensure the DV is a count with the same range and missing handling as Bryson’s.

## 9) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Use the correct dataset and year**: GSS 1993.
2. **Recreate both DVs exactly**:
   - DV1 = number of disliked genres among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}
   - DV2 = number of disliked genres among the other 12 genres (exact list must match Bryson)
3. **Recreate racism score** using Bryson’s items and coding direction.
4. **Recreate covariates** with correct definitions:
   - Education (years or degree recode per paper)
   - Household income **per capita** (correct denominator; consider log if Bryson did)
   - Occupational prestige (correct GSS prestige scale; correct direction)
   - Female (1=female)
   - Age in years
   - Race dummies with White as reference
   - Conservative Protestant dummy (ensure correct denomination classification)
   - No religion dummy (fix your current all-zero bug)
   - South (residence in South per Census region)
5. **Match missing data handling** (listwise deletion likely, but must reproduce Bryson’s N=644/605).
6. **Apply weights if used in the paper** (check Bryson’s methods section/notes).
7. **Output format**: standardized coefficients + stars only; no SE columns.

If you tell me (a) the exact variable mapping you used for racism, religion, region, and the genre “dislike” coding, and (b) whether you used weights, I can pinpoint which specific coding choices most likely caused each sign flip (especially racism, age, prestige, Hispanic/other race).
