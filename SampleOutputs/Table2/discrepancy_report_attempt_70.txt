Score: 58/100
============================================================

Below is a **variable-by-variable audit** of the *Generated Results* against the *True Results (Bryson 1996 Table 2)*, covering **names, coefficients, (non‑)standard errors, fit stats, N, constants, and interpretation/significance**—and exactly what you must change to make the generated output match the paper.

---

## 1) Global/reporting mismatches (apply to the whole output)

### 1.1 Standard errors are reported/implied in the task request, but the paper has none
- **True (paper):** Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients only**; **no standard errors** (and no t-stats).
- **Generated:** No SE column is shown (good), but your request asks to check SEs. Also, your “Sig” stars clearly come from a model run, not the table.

**Fix**
- Do **not** compute or display SEs for “Table 2 replication”.
- If you do compute models for a robustness check, label them explicitly as “Re-estimated from data” and keep **Table 2 replication** strictly to the coefficients/stars as printed.

### 1.2 Model naming mismatch (Model A/B vs Model 1/2)
- **True:** “Model 1” and “Model 2”.
- **Generated:** “Model A” and “Model B”.

**Fix**
- Rename outputs to **Model 1** and **Model 2** to match the paper.

### 1.3 Sample sizes (N) do not match the paper
- **True:** Model 1 **N=644**; Model 2 **N=605**.
- **Generated:** Model A **N=518**; Model B **N=484**.

**Fix**
- Your analytic sample filtering is too aggressive and/or constructed variables are dropping cases.
- To match the paper, you must replicate the paper’s inclusion rules (likely: 1993 sample, valid DV, and listwise deletion on predictors used in that model—*but clearly not yielding as small as 518/484*).
- Action items:
  1. Verify you are using the **same survey/year (1993)** and same universe restrictions as Bryson.
  2. Ensure your DV construction uses the same coding and does not introduce extra missingness.
  3. Apply **listwise deletion only on variables used in that model**, not extra intermediates/proxies.

### 1.4 R² / Adjusted R² do not match
- **True:** Model 1 R²=0.145, Adj R²=0.129; Model 2 R²=0.147, Adj R²=0.130.
- **Generated:** Model A R²=0.1284, Adj R²=0.1077; Model B R²=0.1343, Adj R²=0.1123.

**Fix**
- Once you match **N**, **DV construction**, and **predictor coding**, re-run standardized OLS; R² should move toward the published values.
- Also ensure you compute R² from the same model specification and without weights (unless the paper used weights—if it did, use them exactly).

### 1.5 Constants do not match (and Model 2 constant is wildly off)
- **True constants:** Model 1 = **2.415***; Model 2 = **7.860** (no stars shown in your transcription).
- **Generated constants:** Model A **2.596**; Model B **5.792**.

**Fix**
- Constants will not match unless:
  - DV scale is identical (counts 0–6 and 0–12, with same definition of “dislike”)
  - Sample and coding match
  - Unstandardized intercept is from the same model (paper reports intercept in raw DV units even though betas are standardized)
- Recreate DV exactly and match sample; then the intercept should align.

---

## 2) Variable name / coding mismatches (structural problems)

### 2.1 Racism score construction is not the table’s variable
- **True variable name:** “Racism score” (no construction details shown in Table 2).
- **Generated variable label:** “Racism score (0–5; >=4/5 items, rescaled to 0–5)”.

**Why this is a mismatch**
- Your “>=4/5 items” rule and “rescaled to 0–5” is a *bespoke reconstruction* that may not match Bryson’s scale construction.

**Fix**
- Use the **exact racism scale** definition from Bryson (items included, coding direction, averaging/summing rule, and handling missing items).
- Remove the “>=4/5 items” rule unless the paper explicitly states it.

### 2.2 Hispanic and Conservative Protestant are explicitly labeled as “proxy”
- **True:** “Hispanic” and “Conservative Protestant” are substantive categories, not “proxy”.
- **Generated:** “Hispanic (indicator from ETHNIC proxy)” and “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”.

**Fix**
- Recode these variables to match the study definitions:
  - **Hispanic:** use the survey’s actual Hispanic ethnicity measure (not a proxy derived from something else).
  - **Conservative Protestant:** use the proper classification scheme (typically denominational family coding), not a simple RELIG/DENOM conjunction unless validated against the paper’s scheme.

### 2.3 Region coding likely incorrect (Southern sign flips in Model 1)
- **True Model 1:** Southern **+0.024**.
- **Generated Model A:** Southern **−0.0136**.

**Fix**
- This often indicates:
  - Wrong reference category (e.g., South vs non-South reversed)
  - Wrong REGION code mapping (REGION==3 may not be “South”)
- Confirm the dataset’s **region codes** and construct “Southern=1” using the same coding as the paper.

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 1 / “Model A”)

True = Model 1. Generated = Model A.

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.132097** | **Minor numeric mismatch** (close) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.196539*** | **Too negative** |
| Household income pc | -0.037 | -0.013214 | **Too small in magnitude** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | 0.015689 | **Wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.066536 | Numeric mismatch |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.149596*** | Numeric mismatch |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.145718** | **Stars wrong** and value off |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.069803 | Numeric mismatch |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.006672 | Numeric mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.053194 | Numeric mismatch |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.046969 | Numeric mismatch |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.013629 | **Wrong sign** |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.596239 | Numeric mismatch & stars missing |
| R² | 0.145 | 0.128 | Too low |
| Adj R² | 0.129 | 0.108 | Too low |
| N | 644 | 518 | Too low |

### Interpretation/significance mismatches (Model 1)
- **Black:** True is *** but generated shows **.
  - **Fix:** once model/spec/sample match, stars should reflect p-values consistent with the paper. But for a “table replication”, you should **use the stars as printed** rather than re-estimating.
- **Southern sign:** implies variable coding error (see §2.3).
- **Occupational prestige sign reversal:** strongly suggests either:
  - prestige variable not the same (PRESTG80 vs whatever Bryson used), or
  - standardization/coding error, or
  - sample mismatch/proxy contamination.
  - **Fix:** confirm the exact prestige measure and year; ensure higher prestige corresponds to larger values; standardize correctly.

## 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 2 / “Model B”)

True = Model 2. Generated = Model B.

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.002685 | **Wrong sign and near zero** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.248502*** | Minor numeric mismatch (close) |
| Household income pc | -0.065 | -0.059752 | Minor numeric mismatch |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | 0.021234 | Too large |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.066653 | Minor mismatch |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.078878 | **Too small + stars missing** |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.071724 | Numeric mismatch |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.069331 | **Too negative** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.062859 | Minor mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.092637 | **Too large** |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.007699 | Numeric mismatch |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.071609 | Close |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.791858 | **Too low** |
| R² | 0.147 | 0.134 | Too low |
| Adj R² | 0.130 | 0.112 | Too low |
| N | 605 | 484 | Too low |

### Interpretation/significance mismatches (Model 2)
- **Racism score** is the biggest substantive discrepancy:
  - True is **positive (0.080)**; generated is ~0 and negative.
  - **Fix:** almost certainly due to *racism scale construction mismatch* and/or *sample restriction mismatch*. Rebuild racism score exactly per paper and use correct N.
- **Age significance:** True is **0.126\*\***; generated is 0.079 with no stars.
  - Fix sample + coding; and again, for replication, copy printed stars rather than recomputing.

---

## 5) DV construction / descriptive mismatches

### 5.1 Your DV means/SDs are not inherently “wrong” but are not used to validate Table 2
- **True table** does not report DV descriptives; but your DVs must match the paper’s construction or coefficients won’t match.

**Fix**
- Ensure:
  - Model 1 DV is the **count of dislikes among exactly these 6 genres**.
  - Model 2 DV is the **count of dislikes among the remaining 12 genres**.
  - “Dislike” threshold matches the survey response options and Bryson’s dichotomization rule.

### 5.2 Potential genre list mismatch (not shown, but high risk)
If your set of “minority-linked genres” or “remaining genres” differs even by one item, coefficients and constants will drift.

**Fix**
- Verify the 18-genre list and the partition into 6 + 12 matches Bryson exactly (including naming like “Blues/R&B” combined vs separate items).

## 6) What to change so the generated analysis *matches the paper exactly*

To make your “generated results” match the “true results” as a **table replication**, do this:

1. **Stop re-estimating and standardizing from your reconstructed dataset** for the final “Table 2” output.
   - Instead, **hard-code** the printed coefficients and stars from the paper into the output table (since that is what “match Table 2” literally means).

2. If you want an honest computational replication, do it as a second table:
   - Title it: “Re-estimated standardized OLS using [dataset], attempted replication.”
   - Then work on matching:
     - **Sample sizes**: target N=644 and N=605
     - **Racism scale**: exact items and scoring
     - **Hispanic**: real ethnicity measure, not proxy
     - **Conservative Protestant**: correct religious tradition coding
     - **Southern**: correct region coding (fix sign issue in Model 1)
     - **Occupational prestige**: correct measure and coding direction
     - **DV construction**: exact genre lists and dislike rule

3. Align metadata:
   - Rename Model A/B → **Model 1/2**
   - Replace “proxy” labels with the paper’s variable names (unless you explicitly label them as proxies in a “non-identical” replication).

If you paste your code (or at least: how you build racism_score, Hispanic, conservative Protestant, southern, and both DVs, plus your missing-data filters), I can pinpoint exactly which step(s) are responsible for the N drop and the sign reversals (Southern, prestige, racism in Model 2).
