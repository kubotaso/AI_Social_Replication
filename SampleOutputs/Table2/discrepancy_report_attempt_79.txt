### 1) Variable-name / inclusion mismatches

| Variable | Generated (what happened) | True Table 2 | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Hispanic** | `NaN` and labeled “unavailable (not in extract; omitted)” in both models | Included in both models: **M1 = -0.058**, **M2 = -0.029** | You *dropped a real predictor* and then claimed it wasn’t in the extract. That changes coefficients of other variables too (omitted-variable bias relative to Table 2). | Include the Hispanic dummy in both models exactly as in the paper (and ensure race dummies use the same reference category as Bryson). |
| **Race dummies generally** | You have `Black`, `Other race`, and omit `Hispanic`; unclear reference category but likely White | Table includes **Black, Hispanic, Other race** (implying White is reference) | Even if White is the reference, omitting Hispanic makes the race set inconsistent with the original specification. | Recreate race coding: White reference, include all three dummies (Black/Hispanic/Other). |

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (Model 1)

*(True = standardized OLS betas as printed; SEs are not in the original table.)*

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | 0.131833** | 0.130** | Small numeric difference | Use the published coefficient (or recompute with same data/weights/standardization; otherwise just report 0.130). |
| Education | -0.180139*** | -0.175*** | Different magnitude | Ensure same sample (N), same coding, same standardization, same weighting (if any). |
| Household income per capita | **+0.008961** | **-0.037** | Wrong sign and magnitude | Income variable likely coded/scaled differently and/or sample differs; also omission of Hispanic can shift it. Use same income measure and transformations as paper; include Hispanic; match sample N=644. |
| Occupational prestige | -0.019019 | -0.020 | Very close | Round/report -0.020. |
| Female | -0.071658 | -0.057 | Too negative | Match sample and coding (female dummy, reference male). |
| Age | 0.156851*** | 0.163*** | Slightly low | Match sample/standardization. |
| Black | -0.141030** | -0.132*** | Different value **and different significance** | Use correct sample and include Hispanic; also significance stars must match printed (***) not (**). |
| Hispanic | omitted | -0.058 | Missing | Add Hispanic dummy. |
| Other race | +0.010867 | -0.017 | Wrong sign | Same: race coding + sample mismatch. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.083766 | 0.063 | Too large | Align coding of religious tradition and sample. |
| No religion | 0.068263 | 0.057 | Too large | Align coding/sample. |
| Southern | 0.026711 | 0.024 | Close | Round/report 0.024. |
| Constant | 2.461148*** | 2.415*** | Different | Use published value; also note: constants are **not standardized**, even if other coefficients are. |

**Model 1 fit / N mismatch**
- Generated: **N=549**, R²=0.133, Adj R²=0.115
- True: **N=644**, R²=0.145, Adj R²=0.129  
**Fix:** replicate the paper’s analytic sample and any weighting/handling of missing data. Your smaller N alone can explain many coefficient differences.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (Model 2)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | **-0.002233** | **+0.080** (ns) | Wrong sign and far from true | Must match sample N=605 and variable construction; also you may have inadvertently estimated a different DV or standardized differently. |
| Education | -0.194316*** | -0.242*** | Too small (less negative) | Sample/standardization mismatch. |
| Household income per capita | -0.035654 | -0.065 | Too small | Match income measure/scaling and sample. |
| Occupational prestige | -0.012431 | **+0.005** | Wrong sign | Coding/sample mismatch. |
| Female | -0.069205 | -0.070 | Essentially matches | Round/report -0.070. |
| Age | 0.119317** | 0.126** | Slightly low | Match sample/standardization. |
| Black | 0.066914 | 0.042 | Too large | Sample mismatch + missing Hispanic can shift race effects. |
| Hispanic | omitted | -0.029 | Missing | Add Hispanic dummy. |
| Other race | 0.076128 | 0.047 | Too large | Sample/coding mismatch. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.101269* | 0.048 (ns) | Too large and wrong significance | Match coding and sample; remove star unless p<.05 per the original. |
| No religion | 0.018895 | 0.024 | Slightly low | Match sample. |
| Southern | 0.075385 | 0.069 | Slightly high | Match sample. |
| Constant | 4.957739*** | 7.860 (no stars shown) | Very different level and implied significance | Constant depends strongly on DV scaling and whether DV is standardized; ensure DV matches paper’s count scale and that you are not standardizing DV when reporting constant. |

**Model 2 fit / N mismatch**
- Generated: **N=507**, R²=0.120, Adj R²=0.100
- True: **N=605**, R²=0.147, Adj R²=0.130  
**Fix:** use the correct analytic sample and same missing-data rules; confirm DV construction exactly matches “count of 12 remaining genres.”

### 4) Standard errors: reported vs. not reported

- **True table**: explicitly **does not report standard errors**.
- **Generated output**: you did **not** report SEs either (good), but the user asked to compare SEs—there are none to compare.
- **Fix**: If you want to align with the paper, **do not invent SEs**. If you compute them yourself, label them as “computed from replication data” and note they are not in Bryson’s Table 2.

---

### 5) Significance-star mismatches

These are interpretation/reporting errors because the stars should match the paper’s printed tests.

Key mismatches:
- **Model 1 Black**: generated **, true ***.
- **Model 2 Racism**: generated no star (fine) but coefficient itself is wrong; true is +0.080 (ns).
- **Model 2 Conservative Protestant**: generated * but true has **no star**.

**Fix:** Once coefficients and sample match, apply stars using the paper’s thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001). If you are not replicating p-values from the same data, then you should **copy the stars exactly as printed** when reproducing Table 2.

---

### 6) Interpretation / labeling mismatches

1) **Standardized vs. unstandardized confusion**
- You label coefficients as “Std_Beta” (standardized), which matches Table 2 for slopes.
- But you also attach stars to the **constant** and call it “intercept (unstandardized)”—fine—but in Model 2 your constant has stars while the true table shows **7.860** with no stars displayed.
- **Fix:** Reproduce constants exactly as in the table (2.415***; 7.860 with no star as printed). Do not standardize the DV if you want the constant to match.

2) **DV construction**
- Your DVs are shown as `dv1_minority6` and `dv2_remaining12`. The constants and R² strongly suggest your DVs and/or sample differ from Bryson’s.
- **Fix:** Rebuild DVs exactly: counts of disliked genres, with the exact genre lists corresponding to “minority-linked (6)” and “remaining (12)” as in the paper, plus the same missing-data handling (e.g., how “don’t know”/missing genre ratings are treated).

## How to fix the generated analysis so it matches Table 2

1) **Use the correct analytic samples**
- Model 1 must be **N=644**
- Model 2 must be **N=605**
- Ensure the same case inclusion criteria as Bryson (listwise deletion rules, valid ranges, and any survey weights if used).

2) **Use the same predictors and coding**
- Include **Black, Hispanic, Other race** dummies (White reference).
- Match definitions for **Conservative Protestant**, **No religion**, **Southern**, **Female**, **Education**, **Income per capita**, **Occupational prestige**, **Age**, **Racism score**.

3) **Ensure coefficients reported are standardized slopes**
- Standardize predictors and DV (or compute standardized betas from an unstandardized regression) in the same way Bryson did.
- Keep in mind: **the constant is not standardized** and will only match if the DV is on the same original metric and centered similarly.

4) **Do not claim variables are “not in extract” when they are in the true table**
- Specifically: **Hispanic** must not be omitted.

5) **Align reporting to the paper**
- Copy exact betas, R², Adj R², and N from Table 2 when the goal is faithful reproduction.
- Do not add SEs; do not alter star patterns; do not round differently than the paper unless you clearly flag it.

If you want, paste the code/data steps used to generate the “Generated Results” and I can pinpoint which specific preprocessing steps (standardization, dummy coding, listwise deletion, weighting, DV construction) are producing the N drops and sign flips (especially income in Model 1 and racism in Model 2).
