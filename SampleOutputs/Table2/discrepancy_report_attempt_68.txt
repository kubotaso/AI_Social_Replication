============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

**A. Missing variable in generated output: `hispanic`**
- **True Table 2 includes** a separate row for **Hispanic** in *both* models.
- **Generated tables omit** `hispanic` entirely.
- **Fix:** Add the `hispanic` dummy variable to both models and to the output table. Ensure the reference category matches the paper (typically White non-Hispanic as the omitted group, with indicators for Black, Hispanic, Other race).

**B. `no_religion` is present but shows NaN**
- **True Table 2 reports** coefficients for **No religion** in both models (Model 1: 0.057; Model 2: 0.024).
- **Generated shows** `no_religion = NaN` (and no p-value), meaning it was not estimated or got dropped (perfect collinearity, missing coding, or not included).
- **Fix:** Ensure `no_religion` is actually in the regression design matrix and not aliased with the intercept or another religion category. If you have multiple religion dummies, omit exactly one reference category (e.g., “Mainline Protestant/Other religion”) and keep the intercept.

**C. Variable naming differences (minor but should match the table)**
- Paper labels: **Education, Age, Southern, Conservative Protestant, Household income per capita, Occupational prestige, Female**.
- Generated uses: `education_years`, `age_years`, `south`, `cons_protestant`, `hh_income_per_capita`, `occ_prestige`, `female`.
- **Fix:** Rename variables in the output to exactly match Table 2 labels (doesn’t change estimates, but is required to “match the paper”).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (direction, magnitude, and significance)

Below I list *every row where the generated standardized coefficient conflicts with the true standardized coefficient*.

## Model 1 (paper’s “Model 1”; your “ModelA”)

| Variable | True coef | Generated std_beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.139* | Significance level wrong (** vs *); magnitude close |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.260*** | Too negative (substantively off) |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | 0.030 | **Sign flips** (should be slightly negative) |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.026 | Too small in magnitude |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.191*** | Somewhat too large |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.127* | Significance wrong (*** vs *); coef close |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.004 | Wrong sign (should be negative, small) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.079 | Slightly high |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN | Not estimated / omitted |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.022 | Close |
| Constant (unstd) | 2.415*** | 2.654*** | Intercept doesn’t match |

Also: **Hispanic** is missing, so the racial composition portion of the model cannot match the paper even if other coefficients were close.

**Fixes for Model 1 coefficient mismatches:**
1. **Use the same sample and year** as the paper: GSS **1993** only, and apply the same restrictions/missing-data handling. Your N is **327** vs true **644**—that alone guarantees different coefficients.
2. **Use the same dependent variable construction**: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin” (6 genres). Your model label suggests `dislike_minority6`, but the N mismatch implies the DV or filtering differs (or you used only complete cases on extra variables).
3. **Replicate the paper’s standardized OLS**: Standardize variables the same way (typically z-scores) and run OLS on the same coding. If you computed “std_beta” via post-hoc scaling rather than true standardized regression, verify it matches.
4. **Match dummy coding/reference categories** for race and religion. Missing `hispanic` and the dropped `no_religion` suggest your coding is not aligned with the paper and may be shifting coefficients (especially for race).

## Model 2 (paper’s “Model 2”; your “ModelB”)

| Variable | True coef | Generated std_beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.005 | Wrong sign and near zero |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.224*** | Somewhat off but closer |
| Household income per capita | -0.065 | -0.095 | Too negative |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.012 | Wrong sign (should be tiny positive) |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.091 | Too negative |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.091 (ns) | Too small; significance wrong |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.112 | Too large |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.132* | Too large; significance wrong |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.080 | Too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN | Not estimated / omitted |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.142** | Much too large; significance wrong |
| Constant (unstd) | 7.860 (no stars shown) | 5.674*** | Intercept doesn’t match; stars don’t match either |

Again: **Hispanic** is missing, so the race block cannot match.

**Fixes for Model 2 coefficient mismatches:**
- Same core fixes as Model 1, especially **sample year, DV construction, and coding**.
- Your N is **308** vs true **605**, indicating you are not estimating the same model on the same sample.
- The **racism coefficient** being near zero/negative while the paper reports +0.080 is a red flag for either (a) different racism scale construction, (b) reversed coding, (c) different DV, or (d) different sample.

### 3) Standard errors and p-values: fundamental mismatch with what the paper reports

**True result:** Table 2 **does not report standard errors** and (in your excerpt) provides only standardized coefficients plus significance markers.

**Generated result:** Reports **p-values** and assigns stars from those p-values.

This creates unavoidable inconsistencies:
- You can’t “compare SEs” to Table 2 because the table doesn’t contain SEs.
- Your star assignments will differ if:
  - you use different N/sample,
  - you use different df,
  - you use robust vs classical SEs,
  - you use one- vs two-tailed tests,
  - you use different missing-data rules.

**Fix:**
- If the goal is to match Table 2, **do not present SEs/p-values** (or clearly label them as newly computed and not from the table).
- Instead, output **standardized coefficients and stars only**, where stars match the paper’s thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001, two-tailed) **using the same model/sample**.
- If you must compute p-values, ensure you replicate the paper’s inferential approach (likely conventional OLS SEs, two-tailed), but note: even then you still need the same N and coding to match.

### 4) Model fit statistics and sample size mismatches

**Model 1:**
- True: **N=644, R²=.145, Adj R²=.129**
- Generated: **N=327, R²=0.190, Adj R²=0.164**
- Mismatch in **N** and both fit metrics.

**Model 2:**
- True: **N=605, R²=.147, Adj R²=.130**
- Generated: **N=308, R²=0.166, Adj R²=0.138**
- Again N is about half.

**Fix:**
- Reconstruct the analytic sample to match Bryson (1996): GSS 1993, correct age/eligibility restrictions (if any), and handle missingness in the same way (the paper likely uses listwise deletion on variables in the model—*but then you should still get N near 644/605, not half*).
- Confirm you are using the same set of genres and the same rules for “dislike” coding and summing.

### 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by the generated output

Even without a written narrative, your generated results *imply* interpretations that contradict the paper because of sign/significance errors:

- **Model 2 racism effect:** Generated suggests “no association” (or slightly negative). The paper shows a **positive** (though not significant) coefficient of **0.080**.  
  **Fix:** Correct racism scale coding and sample/DV construction until coefficient direction aligns.

- **Southern effect in Model 2:** Generated makes it large and significant (**0.142**), while paper reports **0.069** (no star).  
  **Fix:** Align sample and DV; check South coding; ensure you’re not inadvertently interacting or filtering.

## Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Use GSS 1993 only** and confirm the same weighting choice as the author (if any; if unsure, try unweighted first).
2. **Rebuild both DVs exactly** as in the table:
   - DV1: count of dislikes among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}
   - DV2: count of dislikes among the other 12 genres
3. **Recreate the racism score** exactly (same items, same direction, same scaling).
4. **Include the full covariate set with correct dummies**:
   - Race: Black, Hispanic, Other race (White omitted)
   - Religion: Conservative Protestant, No religion (plus omitted reference category), with intercept included
5. **Standardize consistently** (z-score predictors and DV, or use standardized beta computation that yields the same as regression on standardized variables).
6. **Output format:** report **standardized coefficients + stars only** (no SEs), because Table 2 doesn’t provide SEs.
7. **Verify targets:** N=644/605 and R²≈.145/.147 before worrying about tiny coefficient differences.

If you share your variable coding rules (especially racism score and the “dislike” construction) and your sample restrictions, I can pinpoint which specific step is causing the N to collapse and the sign flips.
