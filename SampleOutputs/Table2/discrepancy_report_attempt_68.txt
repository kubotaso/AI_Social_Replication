### 1) Sample size and model fit mismatches (major)

**Mismatch**
- **Model A N**: Generated **438** vs True **644**
- **Model B N**: Generated **406** vs True **605**
- **Model A R² / Adj R²**: Generated **0.128 / 0.103** vs True **0.145 / 0.129**
- **Model B R² / Adj R²**: Generated **0.134 / 0.108** vs True **0.147 / 0.130**
- **Constants**: Generated **2.695*** (A) and **5.777*** (B) vs True **2.415*** (A) and **7.860** (B; no stars shown in the paper)

**Why this happened**
- Your replication is not using the same **analytic sample restrictions** (missing-data handling, universe restrictions, and/or weighting) as Bryson (1996).
- Possibly you:
  - dropped far more cases via listwise deletion (your N’s are much smaller),
  - computed some predictors differently (e.g., religion, ethnicity, racism index),
  - used different coding for DV or included/excluded “don’t know/refused” differently.

**How to fix**
1. Reconstruct the **exact sample definition** used for Table 2:
   - Same survey year/wave (1993) and same population restrictions (e.g., adults only, valid interviews, etc.).
   - Same missing-data rules (very likely **listwise deletion on the variables in the model**, but *with different recodes than yours* so fewer missing values are created).
2. Ensure **DV construction** matches the paper (see DV checks below).
3. Use the same **weights** (if Bryson used a weight, your standardized coefficients and R² can shift). The paper often uses survey weights; confirm and apply them identically.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches by variable (Model A)

True Model 1 coefficients vs Generated ModelA_Std_Beta:

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130** ** | 0.127864 ** | small numerical diff (ok-ish) |
| Education | **-0.175*** | -0.207688*** | too negative |
| Household income per capita | **-0.037** | 0.031711 | **wrong sign** |
| Occupational prestige | **-0.020** | 0.006712 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.074181 | too negative |
| Age | **0.163*** | 0.139927 ** | too small + wrong sig level (*** → **) |
| Black | **-0.132*** | -0.159406 ** | too negative + wrong sig level (*** → **) |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.061813 | close |
| Other race | **-0.017** | 0.017524 | **wrong sign** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.090376 | too large |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.064291 | close-ish |
| Southern | **0.024** | -0.014452 | **wrong sign** |
| Constant | **2.415*** | 2.695252*** | too large |

**How to fix (Model A)**
- The sign flips (income, prestige, other race, southern) strongly indicate **coding/recoding differences** and/or **sample-selection differences**.
- Specific likely causes and fixes:
  1. **Household income per capita (REALINC/HOMPOP)**  
     - You may be using a different income measure (or different top/bottom coding) than Bryson.  
     - Fix: verify the exact “REALINC” definition, handle 0/NIU correctly, and confirm HOMPOP is household size used in the paper. Ensure per-capita income is computed only when both components are valid and coded consistently.
  2. **Occupational prestige (PRESTG80)**  
     - Prestige scales often have NIU for nonworkers; if you set NIU to 0 or drop them inconsistently you’ll alter coefficients and N.  
     - Fix: match Bryson’s handling (likely keep valid prestige only; possibly impute or include a “missing prestige” indicator—check paper/method notes).
  3. **Race categories**  
     - “Other race” being wrong sign suggests your reference group or category mapping differs.  
     - Fix: ensure race dummies match the paper’s: White reference, Black dummy, Hispanic dummy (ethnicity), Other race dummy. Don’t let Hispanic overlap incorrectly with race if the paper treated Hispanic as separate from race categories.
  4. **Southern (REGION==3)**  
     - The paper’s “South” may not be GSS REGION==3 exactly (e.g., could be Census region, or a different coding/year).  
     - Fix: confirm the exact “South” definition Bryson used; recode accordingly.
  5. **Age significance**  
     - Your age coefficient is smaller and loses a star; that commonly happens with smaller N and/or different variance from recodes/weights.  
     - Fix: once N and coding match, stars should match.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches by variable (Model B)

True Model 2 coefficients vs Generated ModelB_Std_Beta:

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.033497 | **wrong sign and magnitude** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.223406*** | too small in magnitude |
| Household income per capita | -0.065 | -0.030935 | too small (toward zero) |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.032094 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.082722 | somewhat too negative |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.101400* | too small + wrong sig level (** → *) |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.042886 | matches well |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.091066 | too negative |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.094967 | too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.099082 | too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.013273 | too small |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.087470 | too large |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.777225*** | too small + stars don’t match table presentation |

**How to fix (Model B)**
- The **racism coefficient** is the biggest red flag: True is **positive (0.080)**, generated is **negative (-0.033)**. That’s not a rounding issue; it’s a definition/sample mismatch.
- Likely causes:
  1. **Racism score not constructed like Bryson’s**  
     - You state: “strict sum of 5 dichotomies.” If Bryson used different cutpoints, included DK as 0/NA, or used a slightly different index, the sign can change.
     - Fix: replicate the exact five items and dichotomization rules from the article/appendix; treat missing exactly as Bryson did.
  2. **Wrong DV composition for “12 remaining genres”**  
     - If your “remaining 12” list differs by even one genre, coefficients can move substantially, including racism.
     - Fix: verify the exact genre set for Model 2 (and Model 1), including any genre that might have been excluded due to missingness or availability in 1993.
  3. **Weighting and standardization**  
     - “Standardized OLS coefficients” should be computed with the same standardization convention (and with weights if used).
     - Fix: standardize variables exactly as Bryson did (most likely z-scoring in the analytic sample; if weighted, use weighted means/SDs).

### 4) Variable name / coding-description mismatches (conceptual)

These aren’t just cosmetic; they signal likely coding differences.

**Mismatch**
- **Hispanic** in the paper is “Hispanic” (likely one dummy), but generated says:  
  “Hispanic (indicator from ETHNIC; missing preserved)”
- **Conservative Protestant** generated is a proxy:  
  “RELIG==1 & DENOM==1; Prot w/ missing DENOM set to 0”

**Why this matters**
- “Missing preserved” and “missing DENOM set to 0” are **not neutral** choices; they change meaning and can shrink N dramatically or bias coefficients.

**How to fix**
- Recode variables to match the paper’s operationalization:
  - If Bryson used GSS-style RELIG and DENOM with a specific Protestant classification, you need that exact mapping (often multiple denominations).
  - Do **not** set missing denominational info to 0 (that reclassifies unknowns as not-conservative-Protestant). Either:
    - drop them (if Bryson did listwise), or
    - create an explicit “missing denomination” indicator and keep them, if that’s what Bryson did (but then your model would differ from the published one unless Bryson also did this).

### 5) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation/reporting)

**Mismatch**
- Model A: Age is **\*\*\*** in true table but **\*\*** in generated.
- Model A: Black is **\*\*\*** true but **\*\*** generated.
- Model B: Age is **\*\*** true but **\*** generated.
- Model B: Racism has **no star** true but generated shows negative and no star (but direction is wrong anyway).
- Constant in Model B: true table shows **7.860** with no stars; generated has **5.777***.

**Why this happened**
- Different N/coding/weights ⇒ different standard errors/p-values.
- Also: the paper **doesn’t print SEs**, but it **does print stars**. So your star-generation must match their p-value computation (two-tailed tests) and the same model.

**How to fix**
- Once the model and sample match, compute p-values from your OLS output and apply:
  - * p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001 (two-tailed)
- For the **constant**: don’t assume stars; match what the table prints. (If Bryson omitted constant stars in Model 2, replicate that presentation choice.)

---

### 6) “Standard errors” requirement: there are none in the true results

**Mismatch**
- You ask to check standard errors, but **the true table does not report SEs**. Your generated output also doesn’t show SEs—only standardized betas and stars.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to match Bryson Table 2, **do not add SE columns** as “truth”; they’re not verifiable from the published table.
- If you still want SEs for your own replication, clearly label them as “replication output (not in Bryson 1996 Table 2).”

---

### 7) DV construction / descriptives inconsistencies (likely source of mismatch)

**Mismatch indicator**
- Your DV descriptives show large-N nonmissing (1134, 1057) but analytic N collapses to 438/406, suggesting **predictor recodes are creating lots of missingness** (religion/denom/income/prestige are usual culprits).

**How to fix**
- Audit missingness variable-by-variable and ensure you are not:
  - converting NIU/DK/refused into missing in a way Bryson didn’t,
  - creating per-capita income missing when household size is missing (maybe Bryson used a different denominator or handled missing household size differently),
  - dropping prestige for nonworkers if Bryson kept them via a method.

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1. **Match the analytic sample** to get N=644 (Model 1) and N=605 (Model 2).  
2. **Rebuild the racism index** exactly as Bryson did (items + dichotomies + missing handling). This is essential because your Model B racism sign is wrong.
3. **Recreate Conservative Protestant** classification according to the paper’s denomination rules—your proxy is almost certainly not equivalent.
4. **Verify DV genre lists** for both models match the paper exactly (the “6 minority-linked” genres and the “12 remaining”).
5. **Use the same weighting and standardization convention** (weighted vs unweighted z-scores can shift standardized betas and R²).
6. Re-run OLS and then **only report standardized coefficients and stars**, matching the table format.

If you paste (a) your code for constructing racism, Hispanic, Conservative Protestant, and both DVs, plus (b) your missing-value recode rules, I can pinpoint exactly which recode(s) are causing the sign flips and the N collapse.
