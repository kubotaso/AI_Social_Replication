Score: 13/100
============================================================

### 1) The biggest structural mismatch: you compared the wrong kind of output
**True Table 2 reports standardized coefficients only (plus stars). It does *not* report SEs or p-values.**  
But your “Generated Results” include:
- `b_unstd` (unstandardized coefficients)
- `beta_std` (standardized)
- `p_value` and `sig` (which require SEs / sampling variance)

So the generated tables cannot “match” Table 2 as printed unless you **(a)** drop unstandardized coefficients and p-values/SEs, or **(b)** re-estimate models from the underlying GSS data to compute p-values (but those p-values still won’t be verifiable from the PDF alone).

**Fix:** To match the paper table, produce a table with:
- variable names exactly as in Table 2,
- *standardized coefficients only*,
- significance stars matching the paper,
- no SEs/p-values columns.

### 2) Sample size and fit statistics do not match (major discrepancy)
#### Model A
- **Generated:** N=327; R²=0.1896; Adj R²=0.1639
- **True:** **N=644; R²=.145; Adj R²=.129**

#### Model B
- **Generated:** N=308; R²=0.1658; Adj R²=0.1377
- **True:** **N=605; R²=.147; Adj R²=.130**

These are not small differences; they imply you are using a **different dataset, different missing-data handling, different coding, or different DV construction**.

**Fixes (most likely):**
1. Use the same survey wave and sample restrictions as Bryson (1993 GSS; Table 2 says “GSS 1993”).  
2. Recreate the two DVs exactly:
   - Model 1 DV: count of disliked genres among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}
   - Model 2 DV: count of disliked among the 12 remaining genres
3. Apply the same missing-data rules: Bryson’s N suggests far less case deletion than your run (you likely listwise-deleted on too many variables or mis-coded DK/NA as missing).
4. Use the same weight (if any). If Bryson used weights and you didn’t (or vice versa), coefficients/R² can move.
5. Ensure the same coding of race/religion/region dummies and reference groups.

### 3) Variable list mismatch: your models omit one predictor from the paper
The paper includes **12 predictors + constant**:
- Racism, Education, Income pc, Occ prestige, Female, Age,
- Black, Hispanic, Other race,
- Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern

Your model fit objects say `k_predictors = 10` and also report `dropped_constant_predictors = no_religion`.

So you are missing at least **two predictors**, and you also **dropped “No religion”** for being constant (which should not happen in the full GSS sample).

**Fix:**
- Ensure your design matrix includes **all 12 predictors**.
- Diagnose why `no_religion` is constant:
  - You may have filtered to a subsample where everyone has the same religion status (bad filter).
  - Or you incorrectly recoded religion so all values became 0/1 the same.
  - Or you created `no_religion` from a variable that is missing for most respondents and then filled missing with 0/1 improperly.

### 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)
Because your tables have no row labels, I can only compare where the *pattern* obviously conflicts with the paper. Still, several conflicts are unambiguous:

#### Model A (true standardized betas)
Key true betas:
- Racism **+0.130** (**)  
- Education **−0.175** (***)  
- Age **+0.163** (***)  
- Black **−0.132** (***)  
- Southern +0.024 (ns)
- Conservative Protestant +0.063 (ns)
- No religion +0.057 (ns)

**Generated Model A `beta_std` includes values like:**
- +0.139 (p=.0125, *) → plausibly racism (+0.130**) but significance level doesn’t match (** vs *)
- **−0.2609 (p=.000034,***)** → could be education, but magnitude is too large (true −0.175)
- **+0.1912 (p=.000598,***)** → could be age, but too large (true +0.163)
- **−0.1272 (p=.0256,*)** → could be black (true −0.132***), but your significance is far weaker than the paper

So even if we guess the mapping, the **magnitudes and stars don’t line up**.

**Likely causes + fixes:**
- Different sample (already indicated by N mismatch) → fix sample construction first.
- Different standardization procedure:
  - Paper reports standardized OLS coefficients (beta weights). You must compute beta as OLS on standardized variables or convert from unstandardized using SD ratios.
  - If you standardized only X’s but not Y, or vice versa, betas will be wrong.
- Different DV coding (e.g., range, inclusion of genres, “dislike” threshold, DK handling) → must replicate genre coding exactly.

#### Model B (true standardized betas)
Key true betas:
- Racism +0.080 (ns)
- Education −0.242 (***)
- Age +0.126 (**)
- Southern +0.069 (ns)
- Black +0.042 (ns)

Your generated Model B has:
- one strong negative beta **−0.2238 (p=.000918,***)** → likely education (close in magnitude to −0.242***, but still off)
- a *positive* beta **+0.1424 (p=.0097,**)** somewhere → but in the paper only Age is notably positive and it’s +0.126** (close-ish). Yet your age might be misaligned or you’re picking up Southern/other variable.

Again: you can’t reliably align without row labels, but the overall mismatch is consistent with **wrong sample + wrong DV + wrong predictor set**.

---

### 5) Intercept/constant mismatch (and also incomparable)
- True constants: **2.415*** (Model 1) and **7.860** (Model 2)
- Generated `b_unstd` constants: **2.6536*** (ModelA) and **5.6737*** (ModelB)

But constants depend heavily on:
- unstandardized DV scale and coding,
- included predictors and reference categories,
- sample composition.

Also: the paper’s table emphasizes standardized coefficients; the intercept is shown but your entire model differs (N differs, predictors differ), so constant won’t match.

**Fix:** replicate DV construction and predictors first; then the intercept should move toward the paper’s.

---

### 6) Standard errors and p-values are not “true-comparable”
You cannot validate:
- your p-values,
- your implied SEs,
against Table 2 because **Table 2 does not publish SEs**.

**Fix options:**
- If the goal is “match the paper table,” remove p-values/SEs and use the paper’s stars.
- If the goal is “reproduce results from data,” then you need to:
  1) re-run OLS on the correct dataset/specification,
  2) compute SEs/p-values yourself,
  3) but accept that you can only compare to the paper via coefficients and star thresholds, not exact SEs.

---

### 7) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)
Even where signs roughly align, the *significance levels* often don’t:
- Example likely: Black in Model 1 is *** in paper (−0.132***), but your plausible Black-ish coefficient is only *.
- Racism in Model 1 is ** in paper (+0.130**), but your plausible racism is *.

**Fix:** once you correct sample size, DV, and predictor set, recompute standardized coefficients and then apply **the same two-tailed thresholds**:
- * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001

Also ensure you are not using robust SEs if Bryson used conventional OLS SEs (or vice versa). Different SE type changes stars.

---

## What you should change so the generated analysis matches the paper
1. **Rebuild the dataset to match Bryson’s analytic sample (GSS 1993, same exclusions, same missing handling).** Target N≈644 and N≈605.
2. **Construct the two dependent variables exactly** as counts of disliked genres with the same genre lists and “dislike” definition.
3. **Include all predictors from Table 2** (12 predictors) and ensure dummy/reference coding matches.
4. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way** and present only those in the “paper-match” table.
5. **Do not report SEs/p-values as if they are from Table 2.** If you compute them from data, label them as your replication output, not “from the PDF table.”
6. **Add row labels** in your output so each coefficient is tied to its variable; otherwise you cannot verify alignment.

If you paste the *variable order* you used (or the regression formula/design matrix) and how you coded each variable/DV, I can map each generated row to the intended Table 2 variable and point out the exact row-by-row mismatches rather than inferring from patterns.
