### 1) Table structure / variable-name mismatches

**Mismatch A: “No religion” is missing in the generated results.**  
- **True Table 2** includes **No religion** in both models (0.057 in Model 1; 0.024 in Model 2).  
- **Generated predictors used** do **not** include `no_religion`, and the coefficient table shows **11 rows**, not the **12** independent variables in the true table.

**How to fix**
- Add the variable used in Bryson (1996) for “No religion” (often a dummy like `norelig` / `none` / `no_religion`) to both models.
- Regenerate the coefficient table with all predictors in the same order as the paper.

---

**Mismatch B: Variable naming does not match the paper’s labels.**  
Generated uses:
- `educ` vs **Education**
- `income_pc` vs **Household income per capita**
- `prestg80` vs **Occupational prestige**
- `cons_prot` vs **Conservative Protestant**
- `southern` matches **Southern**
- race dummies: `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` match conceptually

This is not necessarily “wrong,” but you were asked to identify mismatches in variable names: the generated table does not label variables, so it cannot be verified row-by-row against the true table.

**How to fix**
- Output the table with an explicit **row label column** mapping each coefficient to the correct variable name (and in the paper’s order).
- Ensure the model matrix uses the same coding as the paper (especially for race and religion dummies and the reference categories).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (direction, magnitude, and significance stars)

Because the generated table provides only coefficients (no variable labels), the safest comparison is against the predictor list order shown in `model_1_predictors_used` / `model_2_predictors_used`. Assuming the generated coefficients are in exactly that order:

#### Model 1 (paper DV: dislike of minority-linked genres)

| Variable (assumed order) | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.140* | 0.130** | magnitude +; **stars wrong** (should be ** not *) |
| Education | -0.260*** | -0.175*** | **too negative** |
| Income pc | -0.012 | -0.037 | too close to 0 |
| Prestige | 0.058 | -0.020 | **sign flip** |
| Female | -0.034 | -0.057 | smaller magnitude |
| Age | 0.175** | 0.163*** | close magnitude; **stars wrong** (*** vs **) |
| Black | -0.177* | -0.132*** | **too negative**; **stars wrong** (*** vs *) |
| Hispanic | -0.007 | -0.058 | too close to 0 |
| Other race | -0.005 | -0.017 | too close to 0 |
| Conservative Prot. | 0.120 | 0.063 | too large |
| Southern | -0.059 | 0.024 | **sign flip** |
| **No religion** | missing | 0.057 | **omitted** |

**Key interpretation errors implied by these mismatches**
- Generated Model 1 would suggest **southerners are less** dislikeful (negative β), but the true table shows a **small positive** association.
- Generated Model 1 suggests prestige increases dislike (positive β), but the true table shows a small negative coefficient.

#### Model 2 (paper DV: dislike of remaining 12 genres)

| Variable (assumed order) | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.013 | 0.080 | **sign flip** and magnitude mismatch |
| Education | -0.165* | -0.242*** | **too small** and **stars wrong** |
| Income pc | -0.077 | -0.065 | close-ish |
| Prestige | -0.079 | 0.005 | **sign flip** |
| Female | -0.082 | -0.070 | close-ish |
| Age | 0.127* | 0.126** | magnitude close; **stars wrong** |
| Black | 0.039 | 0.042 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.023 | -0.029 | close |
| Other race | 0.122* | 0.047 | **too large** and stars likely wrong |
| Conservative Prot. | 0.142* | 0.048 | **too large** and stars likely wrong |
| Southern | 0.104 | 0.069 | somewhat larger |
| **No religion** | missing | 0.024 | **omitted** |

**Key interpretation errors implied**
- Generated Model 2 would conclude racism has ~0 or even negative association with disliking remaining genres; the true result is **positive (0.080)** (though not starred).
- Prestige again has the wrong sign.

### 3) Standard errors: required vs not reported

**Mismatch C: The prompt asks to compare standard errors, but the generated results do not provide SEs at all.**  
- The true table also **does not report SEs**, only standardized betas and significance stars.
- So: you can’t “match” standard errors to the true table—there are none to match.

**How to fix**
- Either:
  1) Remove SE comparisons entirely and restrict to standardized betas + stars, **or**
  2) If you insist on SEs, compute them from the replication dataset, but then you must **not claim** they come from the paper’s Table 2. You would present them as *replication SEs (not reported in Bryson 1996)*.

---

### 4) Model fit and sample size mismatches

**Mismatch D: N is wildly off.**  
- **Generated:** N=261 (Model 1) and N=259 (Model 2)  
- **True:** N=644 (Model 1) and N=605 (Model 2)

This is not a minor discrepancy; it indicates your analysis is not using the same sample and/or you are losing cases through missing-data handling.

**How to fix**
- Use the same dataset/wave/sample restrictions as Bryson (1996).
- Reproduce the paper’s missing-data approach. If listwise deletion is used, you must have similar missingness patterns; your missingness tables show enormous missing shares (e.g., ~0.48 on the first predictor), which would crush N.
- Verify you are not accidentally restricting to a subsample (e.g., only respondents with complete music batteries, or a particular year, or a demographic subset).

---

**Mismatch E: R² / Adj R² do not match.**  
- **Generated:** R²=0.178 (M1) and 0.151 (M2)  
- **True:** R²=0.145 (M1) and 0.147 (M2)

Given your N is also wrong, this is expected.

**How to fix**
- Once the correct sample and variable coding match, recompute standardized OLS. R² should move toward the published values.

---

**Mismatch F: Constants do not match and appear inconsistent with DV scale.**  
- **Generated constants:** 2.593 (M1) and 5.185 (M2)  
- **True constants:** 2.415 (M1) and 7.860 (M2)

Also, your DV descriptives show ranges:
- dv1: 0–6 (mean 2.06) — plausible with constant around 2–3
- dv2: 0–12 (mean 3.78) — paper’s constant 7.86 is much higher than your scale/mean, suggesting you may not be using the same DV construction/coding.

**How to fix**
- Recreate the dependent variables exactly as in the paper:
  - Which genres are included in each index
  - How “dislike” is coded (binary? scaled? summed?)
  - Whether items are reverse-coded
  - Whether the index is a sum or mean and how missing items are handled
- Only after the DV is constructed identically will the intercept be comparable.

---

### 5) Interpretation / reporting mismatches

**Mismatch G: You are treating stars as if they come from your regression, but the paper’s stars correspond to its own tests.**  
Since your coefficients differ and your N differs, your p-values (and thus stars) will differ too. Even if you had the same betas, different N changes significance.

**How to fix**
- If the goal is to match the paper: match **sample + coding + standardization**, then compute t-tests and stars; they should align closely.
- If you cannot match the paper’s sample, do **not** reuse the paper’s significance narrative; report your own results as a separate analysis.

### 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true Table 2

1) **Rebuild DVs exactly**
   - DV1: dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin
   - DV2: dislike of remaining 12 genres
   - Confirm item response coding, summing/averaging rules, and missing-item handling.

2) **Add the missing predictor**
   - Include **No religion** dummy with the same reference category as Bryson.

3) **Match coding / reference categories**
   - Race dummies: ensure the omitted category matches the paper (very likely White).
   - Religion: Conservative Protestant and No religion should be defined as in the article’s coding scheme.

4) **Use standardized OLS coefficients**
   - Table 2 is **standardized betas**. Ensure you standardize variables the same way (typically z-scoring X’s and Y or using software standardized coefficients).
   - If you only standardize X and not Y, your “beta” won’t match.

5) **Fix missing data / sample selection to recover N≈644 and 605**
   - Diagnose which variables are creating the 0.36–0.48 missingness shares.
   - Ensure you’re not merging incorrectly, not dropping waves, and not inadvertently filtering respondents.

6) **Recompute fit stats and then stars**
   - After the above, R²/Adj R² and stars should be comparable.

If you paste the coefficient table again *with row names attached to each coefficient*, plus your exact DV construction rules and missing-data handling (listwise vs item-mean imputation, etc.), I can point to the exact row-level mismatches unambiguously (including whether your coefficient ordering is misaligned).
