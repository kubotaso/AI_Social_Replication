Score: 25/100
============================================================

### 1) The models are not the same (sample size, DV construction, and model numbering)

**Mismatch**
- **N**: Generated models use **N=261** and **N=259**, but the true table reports **N=644** (Model 1) and **N=605** (Model 2).
- **DVs**: Generated DVs are `dv1_dislike_minority_linked_6` and `dv2_dislike_remaining_12`. Those correspond conceptually to Bryson’s two DVs, but your descriptives show **max = 6 and 12** and means around **2.06** and **3.78**. Bryson’s constants (2.415 and 7.860) suggest the DV scaling/aggregation in the paper is not the same as yours (or at least not standardized/centered the same way).
- **Model naming**: Your “model_2A” appears to correspond to Bryson **Model 1** (minority-linked 6), and your “model_2B” corresponds to Bryson **Model 2** (remaining 12). But you label both as “2A/2B” which makes comparisons easy to mix up.

**How to fix**
- Recreate the paper’s **analytic sample** (GSS years, exclusions, missing-data handling, weights, etc.) to match **N=644/605**.
- Recreate the DVs exactly as Bryson did (sum/mean of dislikes? which items? how “don’t know” handled? any rescaling?). Your DV ranges suggest a simple count of “dislike” responses; the paper’s intercepts imply a different scale or different coding.
- Rename outputs to match the paper: **Model 1 = minority-linked 6**, **Model 2 = remaining 12**.

---

### 2) You are comparing different estimands: paper reports **standardized betas only**, your “full” tables are **unstandardized b + SE + t**

**Mismatch**
- The true results are **standardized OLS coefficients**. SEs are **not reported** in the paper.
- Your output includes both unstandardized (`b_unstd`) and standardized (`beta_std`)—but your “fit” table displays **unstandardized intercept** and your “full” tables mix unstandardized inference with standardized coefficients.
- In your “table2_style” you present standardized betas with stars—this is the right *format*, but the values don’t match the published standardized betas.

**How to fix**
- To match Table 2: report only **standardized betas** (and optionally stars), **omit SE/t** unless you compute them yourself and clearly label them as your replication inference (not from the table).
- Ensure your standardization matches Bryson’s: typically standardized beta = coefficient from regression on **z-scored X and z-scored Y** (or equivalently unstandardized b multiplied by SDx/SDy).

---

### 3) Variable-name / row-order alignment is broken (you cannot tell which coefficient is which)

**Mismatch**
- In `model_2A_full` and `model_2B_full`, the coefficient rows are **unnamed**. Then `table2_style` shows 12 rows of betas but also **NaN rows**, implying a merge/join failure (probably a dummy category omitted or a variable missing in one model).
- The true table has exactly these predictors (same order in both models):
  1. Racism score  
  2. Education  
  3. Household income per capita  
  4. Occupational prestige  
  5. Female  
  6. Age  
  7. Black  
  8. Hispanic  
  9. Other race  
  10. Conservative Protestant  
  11. No religion  
  12. Southern  
  + Constant, R², Adj R², N

Your generated output has 12 betas per model but one row is NaN (and constants are treated separately), so mapping is ambiguous and likely wrong.

**How to fix**
- Output coefficient tables **with variable names** and enforce the same order as the paper.
- When building `table2_style`, merge on an explicit key (variable name), not row position.
- Remove NaN rows by fixing the underlying cause (e.g., a variable dropped for collinearity, a category absent in one sample, or a join mismatch like `black` vs `Black`).

### 4) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas) — nearly all predictors differ from the true table

Because your rows are unlabeled, I’ll compare by *pattern* and by the few values that clearly correspond to specific variables in Bryson (e.g., Education is strongly negative in both models, Age is positive).

#### Model corresponding to Bryson Model 1 (minority-linked 6)
**True standardized betas (Model 1):**
- Racism **0.130**  
- Education **-0.175**  
- Income **-0.037**  
- Prestige **-0.020**  
- Female **-0.057**  
- Age **0.163**  
- Black **-0.132**  
- Hispanic **-0.058**  
- Other race **-0.017**  
- Cons. Prot. **0.063**  
- No religion **0.057**  
- Southern **0.024**

**Generated standardized betas (model_2A/table2_style) include:**
- 0.1727**, -0.1751*, 0.1212, -0.2600***, -0.0347, 0.0151, -0.0132, 0.0558, -0.0050, 0.1431*, -0.0627, plus a NaN row.

**Mismatches**
- Education in the paper is **-0.175***; you have a **-0.260*** somewhere (too large in magnitude) and also a **-0.175***-ish value but with only one star. Without names, you likely mis-assigned rows or your education variable is not coded the same.
- Age should be **+0.163***; you have **+0.1727** (close) but star levels differ (paper ***/your **).
- Racism should be **+0.130**; you have candidates **+0.1431** or **+0.1212**—both plausible but not equal.
- Black should be **-0.132***; you have **-0.1751***-ish (too negative) as one candidate; could be mis-coded race dummies or different base category.
- Several predictors’ signs/magnitudes differ (e.g., you have a fairly large **+0.1431*** that doesn’t correspond to any large positive coefficient in Model 1 besides Age and Racism).

#### Model corresponding to Bryson Model 2 (remaining 12)
**True standardized betas (Model 2):**
- Racism **0.080**  
- Education **-0.242***  
- Income **-0.065**  
- Prestige **0.005**  
- Female **-0.070**  
- Age **0.126**  
- Black **0.042**  
- Hispanic **-0.029**  
- Other race **0.047**  
- Cons. Prot. **0.048**  
- No religion **0.024**  
- Southern **0.069**

**Generated standardized betas (model_2B/table2_style) include:**
- 0.1246, 0.0418, 0.1427*, -0.1645*, -0.0832, 0.0089, -0.0796, -0.0838, 0.1247*, -0.0082, 0.0991, plus NaN row.

**Mismatches**
- Education should be **-0.242***; your most negative is about **-0.164*** (not negative enough).
- Age should be **+0.126** (with ** in paper); you have **+0.1246** (close) but only marginal (no stars) in your model.
- Racism should be **+0.080**; you have **+0.099** or **+0.1247**—too large.
- Several signs do not match well, and you appear to have multiple positive ~0.12 coefficients that don’t exist in the paper aside from Age (0.126) and maybe Southern (0.069).

**How to fix (for coefficient mismatches)**
1. **Match the sample and weights** (biggest driver of coefficient differences in replications of published GSS analyses).
2. **Recode predictors exactly**:
   - Education: years vs categories? top-coding?
   - Income per capita: continuous? logged? divided by household size?
   - Occupational prestige: which prestige scale? missing handling?
   - Race dummies: base group must be White; ensure mutually exclusive Black/Hispanic/Other.
   - Religion: “Conservative Protestant” definition is often denominational + fundamentalism; “No religion” excludes missing/other.
   - Southern: region coding.
3. **Standardize consistently** (z-score using the model’s estimation sample).
4. Ensure you did **OLS** (not robust regression, not different link function).
5. Confirm you are using the **same DV coding** (counts vs averages vs scale). Different DV scale changes standardized betas too (via SDy).

---

### 5) Intercepts and R² do not match the paper

**Mismatch**
- Paper constants: **2.415*** (Model 1) and **7.860** (Model 2).
- Generated intercepts: **2.605*** and **5.195***.
- Paper R²: **0.145** and **0.147**; generated R²: **0.178** and **0.151** (and very different Adj R² too).

**How to fix**
- Again: sample, DV construction, and predictor coding must match.
- If the DV is a *count of dislikes* (0–6; 0–12), your intercepts should be in that range but will differ depending on covariate means. Bryson’s 7.860 for the 12-genre DV suggests a much higher baseline than your mean (3.78), strongly indicating you are not using the same DV metric.

---

### 6) Significance stars and inference don’t match (and may be computed incorrectly for standardized betas)

**Mismatch**
- Paper star levels reflect p-values for the standardized OLS coefficients (equivalently for unstandardized coefficients; p-values are invariant to linear rescaling).
- Your stars differ (e.g., the age-like coefficient is ** in your model vs *** in paper; education-like coefficients’ stars differ).
- You also have NaN t/p in one row, meaning the model had a coefficient with zero SE (indicative of a coding/estimation error: constant column duplicated, perfect collinearity, or a placeholder row).

**How to fix**
- Remove the NaN row by fixing the design matrix (drop redundant predictors; ensure one category omitted per set of dummies).
- Compute p-values from the fitted OLS model correctly; do not attempt to infer p-values from standardized betas alone if you’re recomputing betas post hoc without the correct variance-covariance transformation.
- Use the same two-tailed thresholds as the paper.

---

### 7) Interpretation mismatch: the generated output encourages interpretation of the wrong quantities

**Mismatch**
- The true table is explicitly **standardized coefficients**; your generated “full” tables prominently show **unstandardized b** with SE/t/p, which invites interpretation in raw DV units. That’s not what Table 2 is presenting.
- Additionally, because the DV scaling seems different, interpreting your unstandardized coefficients as if they replicate Bryson would be misleading.

**How to fix**
- Present a “Table 2 replication” that is *only* the standardized betas in the paper’s variable order, plus R²/Adj R²/N, and the same star scheme.
- Provide a separate appendix table for unstandardized coefficients (clearly labeled as such).

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996) Table 2
1. **Rebuild both DVs** exactly as in the paper (items, coding, aggregation, missing handling).
2. **Use the correct GSS sample** and restrictions to get **N=644** and **N=605**.
3. **Recode predictors** to match definitions (especially income per capita, conservative Protestant, race dummies).
4. Fit **OLS** with the exact predictor set.
5. Compute **standardized betas** on the estimation sample.
6. Output a table with **named rows**, no NaNs, correct order, and stars from the model p-values.
7. Verify: constants (unstd), R², Adj R², and betas match the printed values within rounding.

If you paste the variable-to-row mapping you intended (i.e., which row in `model_2A_full` corresponds to racism, education, etc.), I can pinpoint *exactly* which specific coefficients are mismatched for each named variable rather than by pattern.
