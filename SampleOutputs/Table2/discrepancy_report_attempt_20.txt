Score: 22/100
============================================================

### A. Global mismatches (the generated output cannot be a replication of Bryson Table 2 as-is)

1. **Sample size is wildly off (N)**
   - **True (paper):** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605  
   - **Generated:** ModelA N=261; ModelB N=259  
   - **Why it’s a mismatch:** Standardized coefficients, significance stars, constants, R²/Adj R² are all functions of the analytic sample. Dropping ~60% of cases will change everything.
   - **How to fix:**
     - Recreate Bryson’s inclusion rules. The generated results show huge missingness (e.g., racism_score missing 47.6%). Bryson’s racism score in Table 2 clearly is *not* missing for ~48% of the sample (otherwise N couldn’t be 644/605).
     - Likely fix: **do not require all 5 racism dichotomies to be non-missing** (“strict sum of 5 dichotomies” is probably wrong). Instead, follow the paper’s scoring rule (often: code missing items as 0/1 in a specific way, or compute the score if at least k items observed, or impute “don’t know,” etc.).
     - Also ensure you are using the same survey year, same population restrictions, and the same treatment of “don’t know / NA / inapplicable” for music items and covariates.

2. **You dropped “No religion” from the models**
   - **True:** “No religion” is included with nonzero coefficients in both models (0.057; 0.024).
   - **Generated:** `No religion` is `NaN` and explicitly flagged as dropped (`Dropped_no_variation no_religion`).
   - **Why it’s a mismatch:** If a predictor is constant (all 0s) in your analytic frame, you’ve miscoded it or filtered the sample incorrectly.
   - **How to fix:**
     - Recode RELIG correctly and keep all religious categories. Your “no religion (RELIG==4)” coding is likely wrong for the dataset/year.
     - Common fix: identify the correct code for “none”/“no religion” (often `0`, `4`, `5`, or a separate value label). Verify with frequency tables before modeling.
     - Do **not** set `no_religion` to missing whenever RELIG is missing if Bryson uses listwise deletion only after constructing variables (or uses a different missing rule). But the key: the variable must vary and be included.

3. **Your constants and R²/Adj R² do not match**
   - **True:** Constant 2.415 (Model 1), 7.860 (Model 2); R² 0.145/0.147; Adj R² 0.129/0.130.
   - **Generated:** Constant 2.600 and 5.198; R² 0.178 and 0.151; Adj R² 0.142 and 0.113.
   - **How to fix:** Once you fix (i) analytic sample construction and (ii) variable coding (especially racism score and religion), refit standardized OLS on the correct sample. The fit stats should move toward the published values.

4. **Significance stars are not comparable**
   - **True:** Stars are based on Bryson’s full sample and his SEs/t-tests (not printed but used).
   - **Generated:** Stars are computed on your much smaller N and different coefficients—so even if coefficients were close, stars could differ.
   - **How to fix:** First match coefficients/sample; then ensure you use the same test type (two-tailed) and same degrees-of-freedom assumptions. Also confirm whether Bryson used weights/design corrections; if he did and you didn’t, stars will differ.

### B. Variable-by-variable coefficient mismatches (sign and/or magnitude)

Below I list every coefficient mismatch between the **generated** standardized betas and the **true** Table 2 coefficients.

#### Model 1 (DV: minority-linked 6 genres)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.143* | magnitude + star mismatch (** vs *) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.260*** | too negative (much larger magnitude) |
| Income pc | -0.037 | -0.013 | too small (toward 0) |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | 0.057 | **sign mismatch** (negative → positive) |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.035 | magnitude mismatch |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.174** | star mismatch (*** → **) |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.200 | too negative + star mismatch (lost ***) |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | 0.030 | **sign mismatch** (negative → positive) |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.005 | magnitude mismatch (closer to 0) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.118 | too large |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN/dropped | **variable omitted** |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.060 | **sign mismatch** (positive → negative) |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.600*** | magnitude mismatch |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.145 / 0.129 | 0.178 / 0.142 | mismatch |

**How to fix Model 1 mismatches:** almost all of these can be explained by (i) wrong N due to wrong missing-data handling (especially racism score), and (ii) wrong coding of race/ethnicity and region/religion. In particular:
- **Hispanic sign flip** strongly suggests your Hispanic indicator is not constructed like Bryson’s (or your reference group differs because of missing/recoding).
- **Southern sign flip** suggests REGION coding mismatch (e.g., “South” not equal to 3; or you used a different region scheme/year).
- **Occupational prestige sign flip** suggests PRESTG80 is mis-scaled, mis-merged, or you standardized incorrectly (e.g., standardizing within a filtered subset, or using an incorrect prestige variable).
- **Black losing significance and becoming much larger in magnitude** is consistent with severe selection bias from listwise deletion (your N=261).

#### Model 2 (DV: remaining 12 genres)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.009 | **sign mismatch** (positive → negative) |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.165* | magnitude + star mismatch |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.079 | modest magnitude mismatch |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.083 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.084 | magnitude mismatch |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.125 (no star) | star mismatch |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.025 | magnitude mismatch |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | 0.018 | **sign mismatch** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.124* | too large + star mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.141* | too large + star mismatch |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN/dropped | **variable omitted** |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.101 | magnitude mismatch |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.198*** | major mismatch (and stars shown though true table prints none) |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.147 / 0.130 | 0.151 / 0.113 | mismatch |

**How to fix Model 2 mismatches:** same root causes, but the **racism sign flip** is especially diagnostic:
- Either your DV is not constructed like Bryson’s “dislike of remaining 12,”
- or your racism score is not constructed like his,
- or both, plus severe sample selection.

### C. Variable name / definition mismatches

These aren’t just labeling differences—they imply different measurements than Bryson’s Table 2.

1. **Racism score construction differs**
   - **Generated label:** “strict sum of 5 dichotomies” with ~48% missing.
   - **True:** “Racism score” (no indication it’s only computed when all 5 present; and N in the paper implies it’s available for most respondents included).
   - **Fix:** Implement racism score exactly as Bryson describes in methods/appendix (not from memory). Key is to reproduce his missing-data rule.

2. **Hispanic definition is wrong**
   - **Generated:** “Hispanic (ETHNIC==1 if observed; else 0; missing if ETHNIC missing)”
   - **True:** “Hispanic” as used in the table (almost certainly a standard dummy among race/ethnicity categories).
   - **Why wrong:** Setting Hispanic to 0 when ETHNIC is observed but not 1, and missing only when ETHNIC missing, can change the sample and the meaning. Also, Bryson likely uses mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories (White omitted; Black, Hispanic, Other as dummies).
   - **Fix:** Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies to match Bryson’s coding scheme and ensure consistent reference category and mutual exclusivity.

3. **Conservative Protestant proxy likely mismatches**
   - **Generated:** “RELIG==1 & DENOM==1”
   - **True:** “Conservative Protestant” (likely constructed from denomination/fundamentalist classification, not just a single RELIG×DENOM cell).
   - **Fix:** Use the dataset’s proper fundamentalist/conservative Protestant classification variable if available, or replicate Bryson’s rule (often based on denomination family codes, not one denomination value).

4. **Southern (REGION==3) is likely miscoded**
   - **True coefficient is positive in both models** (0.024; 0.069).
   - **Generated has negative in Model 1.**
   - **Fix:** Confirm REGION coding/value labels for the year. REGION==3 may not be “South” (or the dataset uses a different region variable). Recode to match “South” definition used by Bryson.

5. **DV construction likely mismatches**
   - You have: “count of 6 dislikes” and “count of 12 dislikes.”
   - Bryson’s DVs are indeed “Dislike of [genres]” but the crucial detail is **how “dislike” is defined** (binary threshold? reverse-coded like score? handling neutral/unknown/not asked?).
   - **Fix:** Match Bryson’s exact operationalization: which response categories count as “dislike,” how missing/neutral responses are treated, and which respondents are asked each genre.

---

### D. Standard errors: required mismatch note

- **True:** The table **does not report SEs**.
- **Generated:** You also do **not** report SEs (only betas and stars).  
- **So:** there is no direct SE mismatch to list. The mismatch is interpretive: your narrative/stars imply comparability, but with wrong N/coding they aren’t comparable.

If you want a strict replication check including SEs, you’d need to compute them from your data and compare *implied* significance to Bryson’s stars—but you still must first match the analytic sample/coding.

---

### E. Interpretation mismatches (what your generated results would imply vs Bryson)

Because several coefficients flip signs (notably **racism, prestige, Hispanic, Southern**), any interpretation claiming you replicated Bryson would be incorrect.

- **Example:** Bryson Model 2 shows racism is **positive** (0.080; ns). Your generated Model B shows racism is **slightly negative** (-0.009). That reverses the substantive direction.
- **Fix:** Do not interpret as a replication until signs and magnitudes match; fix variable construction and sample inclusion first.

---

### F. Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true Table 2

1. **Rebuild the analytic sample to hit N≈644 and N≈605**
   - Start from the same survey wave/population as Bryson.
   - Implement *his* listwise deletion rule (likely: listwise on variables in the model **after** constructing indices with his missing rules).
   - Do not use a “strict sum” racism score if that creates ~48% missingness.

2. **Recode “No religion” correctly**
   - Verify RELIG coding; rebuild `no_religion` so it varies and matches Bryson’s definition.
   - Ensure it remains in the model and is not being dropped due to zero variance.

3. **Fix race/ethnicity dummies**
   - Ensure Black/Hispanic/Other are defined consistently and mutually exclusively (with White as omitted reference, typically).
   - Do not condition Hispanic on “ETHNIC observed” in a way that changes the sample relative to other race variables unless Bryson did.

4. **Fix Conservative Protestant**
   - Replace the crude proxy with Bryson’s classification. If not available, reconstruct from denomination families per his description.

5. **Fix REGION/South**
   - Confirm correct “South” coding and recode accordingly.

6. **Match DV coding**
   - Confirm which responses count as “dislike.”
   - Confirm the genre list is exactly the same and that the “remaining 12” excludes the “minority-linked 6” with no overlap/missing distortions.

7. **Then recompute standardized coefficients**
   - Standardize variables the same way (typically z-scoring predictors and DV within the analytic sample), or run OLS and report standardized betas.
   - After this, compare coefficients and then stars (two-tailed p-values).

If you paste the code (or variable codebook snippets) you used to construct **racism_score**, **no_religion**, **cons_prot**, **hispanic**, and the two DVs, I can pinpoint the exact recode/error causing each sign flip and the N collapse.
