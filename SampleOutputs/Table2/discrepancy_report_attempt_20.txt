Score: 18/100
============================================================

## Global discrepancies (apply to both models)

1. **Standard errors / p-values are invented**
   - **Generated:** reports `p_value_replication` for every term (and shows `sig` stars derived from those p-values).
   - **True (paper):** **Table 2 does not report SEs or p-values**; it reports **standardized coefficients with significance markers only**.
   - **Fix:** Do **not** claim SEs or p-values “from Table 2.” If you must show p-values, you need the microdata and must re-estimate the model; otherwise, present only the standardized betas and the paper’s stars.

2. **Unstandardized coefficients are missing/incorrectly handled**
   - **Generated:** column `b_unstd` is `NaN` for all predictors and only gives a constant.
   - **True:** table is standardized; **unstandardized b’s are not provided**. (The constant is shown, but the rest are standardized.)
   - **Fix:** Either (a) remove `b_unstd` entirely (preferred, to match Table 2), or (b) compute unstandardized coefficients from the raw data and clearly label them as new results (not from Table 2).

3. **Sample size and fit statistics don’t match**
   - **Generated Model A fit:** N=419, R²=0.1587, Adj R²=0.1381  
     **True Model 1:** N=644, R²=.145, Adj R²=.129
   - **Generated Model B fit:** N=412, R²=0.1661, Adj R²=0.1453  
     **True Model 2:** N=605, R²=.147, Adj R²=.130
   - **Fix:** Use the same sample restrictions as Bryson (1993 GSS; same missing-data handling, same constructed DVs/IVs). Your current pipeline is dropping ~1/3 of cases. Common causes:
     - listwise deletion on variables not used in the original table,
     - different coding that creates extra missingness,
     - using a subset (e.g., only a module) instead of full GSS 1993 sample,
     - wrong year(s) or pooled years.

4. **Variable list is incomplete / mismatched**
   - **Generated:** no `hispanic` row in either model; includes `other_race`.
   - **True:** includes **both `Hispanic` and `Other race`** (and `Black`), plus **`No religion`**.
   - **Fix:** Add a separate `hispanic` indicator and ensure race categories match the paper (reference category is presumably White, non-Hispanic). Also include `no_religion` with an actual coefficient.

5. **`no_religion` is missing (NaN)**
   - **Generated:** `no_religion` has NaN coefficient/p-value in both models.
   - **True:** `No religion` is **0.057** (Model 1) and **0.024** (Model 2).
   - **Fix:** This usually means perfect collinearity or a coding error (e.g., `no_religion` is all missing, all zeros, or is the reference category of a religion factor but still being printed). Recode religion dummies so exactly one category is omitted as reference and `no_religion` is estimable.

## Model-by-model term mismatches (coefficients + signs + significance)

### Model A (paper Model 1: “Dislike minority genres”)

**Key mismatches:**
- **racism_score**
  - Generated: **0.1459** with `**` (p≈.0035)
  - True: **0.130** with `**`
  - Fix: Minor numeric discrepancy—likely different sample/coding/standardization. Match N=644 and Bryson’s variable construction; then re-standardize consistently.

- **education_years**
  - Generated: **-0.2613***  
  - True: **-0.175***  
  - Fix: same as above (sample/coding). Also check whether Bryson uses “Education” in years vs degree categories converted to years.

- **hh_income_per_capita**
  - Generated: **-0.0199** (ns)
  - True: **-0.037** (ns)
  - Fix: income equivalization and coding likely differ. Confirm “per capita” definition and any top-coding/income midpoints used.

- **occ_prestige**
  - Generated: **+0.0564** (ns) **SIGN ERROR**
  - True: **-0.020** (ns)
  - Fix: verify prestige scale and merge. A sign flip often comes from (a) reverse-coding, (b) using a different occupational status variable, or (c) standardizing after imputing/recoding incorrectly.

- **female**
  - Generated: **-0.0082** (ns; near zero)
  - True: **-0.057** (ns)
  - Fix: check coding (0/1 direction, inclusion of nonbinary/missing codes, weights). Ensure female=1 matches the paper.

- **age_years**
  - Generated: **0.1087*** (p≈.027)
  - True: **0.163*** (stronger, p<.001)
  - Fix: mismatch indicates sample restriction/age coding differences (age in years vs categories; truncation). Restore N and original coding.

- **black**
  - Generated: **-0.1627** with `**`
  - True: **-0.132*** (more significant)
  - Fix: again likely sample/weighting. Also confirm race coding and whether Hispanic is separated (it is in the paper). Omitting Hispanic can distort Black coefficient and SEs.

- **other_race**
  - Generated: **+0.0265** (ns) **SIGN ERROR**
  - True: **-0.017** (ns)
  - Fix: race coding mismatch and missing Hispanic category are prime suspects.

- **cons_protestant**
  - Generated: **0.0775** (ns)
  - True: **0.063** (ns)
  - Fix: likely close; but still suggests different construction of “conservative Protestant” classification.

- **south**
  - Generated: **0.0086** (ns)
  - True: **0.024** (ns)
  - Fix: verify region coding; ensure “South” matches Census region definition in GSS.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **2.713***  
  - True: **2.415***  
  - Fix: with standardized predictors, the constant should be near the mean of the DV (given standardization conventions). This difference again signals DV construction/sample mismatch.

**Variables missing entirely (Model 1):**
- **Hispanic**: True coefficient **-0.058**; Generated: missing.
- **No religion**: True **0.057**; Generated: NaN.

### Model B (paper Model 2: “Dislike remaining 12 genres”)

**Key mismatches:**
- **racism_score**
  - Generated: **0.0086** (ns)
  - True: **0.080** (ns)
  - Fix: big discrepancy. Check racism scale construction (items, coding direction, standardization). Also sample mismatch (N 412 vs 605).

- **education_years**
  - Generated: **-0.2266***  
  - True: **-0.242***  
  - Fix: fairly close; still adjust sample/coding to match.

- **hh_income_per_capita**
  - Generated: **-0.0655** (ns)
  - True: **-0.065** (ns)
  - Fix: this one matches well (good sign).

- **occ_prestige**
  - Generated: **-0.0458** (ns) **SIGN ERROR**
  - True: **+0.005** (ns)
  - Fix: same prestige variable/coding issue as Model A.

- **female**
  - Generated: **-0.0778** (ns; p≈.093)
  - True: **-0.070** (ns)
  - Fix: close; sample differences likely.

- **age_years**
  - Generated: **0.0418** (ns) **MAGNITUDE + SIGNIFICANCE WRONG**
  - True: **0.126** with `**`
  - Fix: age coding and/or sample issue is substantial here.

- **black**
  - Generated: **+0.1018***  
  - True: **+0.042** (ns)
  - Fix: omission/miscoding of Hispanic and race categories can inflate this. Also check weights and DV definition.

- **other_race**
  - Generated: **+0.1027***  
  - True: **+0.047** (ns)
  - Fix: again race/Hispanic omission and sample differences.

- **cons_protestant**
  - Generated: **0.1056***  
  - True: **0.048** (ns)
  - Fix: conservative Protestant classification likely differs (e.g., different denomination grouping).

- **south**
  - Generated: **0.1443** with `**`
  - True: **0.069** (ns)
  - Fix: region coding and sample mismatch; also could be that “South” is being conflated with something else (e.g., “born in South”).

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **5.898***  
  - True: **7.860** (no stars shown in paper table)
  - Fix: DV construction mismatch (count of disliked genres among 12 remaining). Your DV mean seems much lower.

**Variables missing entirely (Model 2):**
- **Hispanic**: True coefficient **-0.029**; Generated: missing.
- **No religion**: True **0.024**; Generated: NaN.

---

## Interpretation mismatches (what you should and should not claim)

- **Generated implicitly interprets significance via p-values** (since it prints p-values and stars).
- **True table’s inference is only via the paper’s stars**; you cannot claim your p-values “match” without re-estimation on the same data.
- **Fix:** If the goal is to “match the paper,” present:
  - standardized betas exactly as in Table 2,
  - the paper’s significance markers,
  - N, R², Adj R² exactly as reported,
  - and explicitly note: “SEs not provided in Table 2.”

## Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Recreate the two DVs exactly**
   - DV1: count of dislikes among the 6 “minority-associated” genres listed.
   - DV2: count of dislikes among the other 12 genres.
   - Ensure the same dislike threshold and missing handling per genre.

2. **Use the correct dataset/sample**
   - GSS **1993** (not pooled, not another year).
   - Apply the same eligibility restrictions (e.g., valid responses on genre dislikes and covariates).
   - Avoid unnecessary listwise deletion: only drop cases missing on variables in the model.

3. **Fix race/ethnicity coding**
   - Include **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race** with **White non-Hispanic as reference** (as implied by the table).
   - Do not collapse Hispanic into “other_race.”

4. **Fix religion coding**
   - Ensure `conservative_protestant` and `no_religion` are both estimable and not accidentally set as reference/collinear.
   - Confirm definition of “conservative Protestant” matches Bryson.

5. **Standardize consistently**
   - Table reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. Confirm you’re reporting standardized betas (not standardized X only, not partially standardized).
   - If you standardize within the estimation sample, do so after the sample is finalized.

6. **Remove SE/p-value columns unless you truly replicate from microdata**
   - To match Table 2, drop `p_value_replication` entirely, or relabel it as “from our re-estimation” and stop comparing it to the paper (since paper doesn’t provide it).

If you paste your variable coding rules (especially for racism score, prestige, conservative Protestant, and the two DV constructions), I can pinpoint which coding choice is producing each sign flip (notably occupational prestige and other_race) and the major N shortfall.
