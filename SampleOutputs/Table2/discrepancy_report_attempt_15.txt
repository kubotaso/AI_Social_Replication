Score: 14/100
============================================================

### 1) Outcome (DV) labeling/definition mismatches

**Mismatch A1 — DV names/wording differ from Table 2**
- **Generated**: “Dislike of minority-linked genres (count of 6)” and “Dislike of remaining genres (count of 12)”.
- **True (Bryson Table 2)**:  
  - Model 1 DV: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”  
  - Model 2 DV: “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”
- **Why it matters**: Your generated labels imply a conceptual grouping (“minority-linked”) rather than the *explicit list* used in the paper.
- **Fix**: Rename the DVs to match the paper exactly, and (if you are computing them) ensure the 6-genre DV is **exactly** those six genres (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin).

**Mismatch A2 — DV descriptives N does not match model N**
- **Generated dv_descriptives**: N=1134 (DV1) and N=1057 (DV2)
- **Generated model fit**: N=274 and N=266
- **True Table 2**: N=644 (Model 1) and N=605 (Model 2)
- **Interpretation problem**: The descriptives appear computed on a much larger sample than the regression sample; then the regression sample is far smaller than the published table. This makes the “generated” analysis incomparable to Bryson’s Table 2.
- **Fix**:
  1. Compute descriptives on the **same analytic sample** used in each model (after listwise deletion or whatever missing-data method you use).
  2. Replicate the paper’s **case selection rules**, weights, and missing-data handling so your model N matches ~644 and ~605.

### 2) Model fit/constant mismatches

**Mismatch B1 — R² and Adjusted R² do not match**
- **Generated**:  
  - Model A R²=0.194, Adj R²=0.157  
  - Model B R²=0.150, Adj R²=0.110
- **True**:  
  - Model 1 R²=0.145, Adj R²=0.129  
  - Model 2 R²=0.147, Adj R²=0.130
- **Fix**: This is not a rounding issue; it indicates you are not running the same model/specification/sample. Align:
  - same sample restrictions,
  - same coding of variables (especially race/region/religion),
  - same missing-data strategy,
  - and ensure these are **standardized OLS** results (see below).

**Mismatch B2 — Constant differs (especially Model 2)**
- **Generated constants**: 2.454 (Model A), 5.655 (Model B)
- **True constants**: 2.415 (Model 1), 7.860 (Model 2; note: the table shows 7.860 without sig stars)
- **Fix**:
  - Verify the DV construction (range 0–6 and 0–12) matches Bryson’s.
  - Ensure the model uses the same coding/reference categories.
  - Confirm whether the paper used weights; weights can shift the intercept and R².

### 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (variable names + signs + magnitudes + significance)

Below I list *every* coefficient mismatch between Generated (ModelA/ModelB) and True (Model1/Model2).

#### Racism score
- **True**: Model1 = 0.130** ; Model2 = 0.080 (ns)
- **Generated**: ModelA = 0.1506* ; ModelB = 0.0135 (ns)
- **Mismatches**:
  - Model A: magnitude and **significance level** differ (** vs *).
  - Model B: coefficient is near zero instead of 0.080.
- **Fix**: Most likely sample/coding mismatch (your missingness shows ~47.6% missing on racism_score, which would drastically alter estimates). Recreate Bryson’s racism scale and missing treatment; confirm it’s the same 0–5 index and that the same respondents are retained.

#### Education
- **True**: Model1 = -0.175*** ; Model2 = -0.242***
- **Generated**: ModelA = -0.3008*** ; ModelB = -0.2318**
- **Mismatches**:
  - Model A too large in magnitude.
  - Model B significance differs (*** in true vs ** in generated).
- **Fix**: Sample size and/or standardization procedure. Also confirm education is coded in years as in the paper and that standardization is done the same way (see Section 5).

#### Household income per capita
- **True**: Model1 = -0.037 ; Model2 = -0.065 (both ns)
- **Generated**: ModelA = -0.0080 ; ModelB = -0.0337
- **Mismatch**: Both models are much closer to zero than the paper.
- **Fix**: Ensure income per capita is computed exactly as REALINC/HOMPOP and treated the same (e.g., no trimming, handling of 0/negative, inflation year). Sample differences can matter here too.

#### Occupational prestige
- **True**: Model1 = -0.020 ; Model2 = 0.005
- **Generated**: ModelA = 0.0950 ; ModelB = -0.0808
- **Mismatch**: Signs are flipped in both models and magnitudes are far off.
- **Fix**: This strongly suggests **you are not using the same prestige variable/coding** (PRESTG80 may be miscoded, reversed, or not the same measure). Confirm:
  - variable is truly PRESTG80,
  - higher = higher prestige (not reversed),
  - missing codes are set to NA,
  - and that prestige is not accidentally standardized within a subgroup.

#### Female
- **True**: Model1 = -0.057 ; Model2 = -0.070
- **Generated**: ModelA = -0.0354 ; ModelB = -0.0701
- **Mismatch**: Model A differs (smaller magnitude), Model B matches closely.
- **Fix**: Model A sample/case composition differs from Bryson’s (e.g., missingness on DV1/racism/religion changes gender composition).

#### Age
- **True**: Model1 = 0.163*** ; Model2 = 0.126**
- **Generated**: ModelA = 0.1590** ; ModelB = 0.1181 (no star shown)
- **Mismatches**:
  - Model A: significance *** vs **.
  - Model B: should be ** but generated shows none.
- **Fix**: Your p-values are being computed from your own model SEs, but Table 2’s stars come from Bryson’s model/sample. To match, you must replicate sample/specification; otherwise stars will differ.

#### Black
- **True**: Model1 = -0.132*** ; Model2 = 0.042
- **Generated**: ModelA = -0.1294 (no star) ; ModelB = 0.0768
- **Mismatches**:
  - Model A: missing *** significance.
  - Model B: coefficient larger than true (0.077 vs 0.042).
- **Fix**: Again indicates different standard errors/sample. Also verify race coding and reference group (likely White as reference).

#### Hispanic
- **True**: Model1 = -0.058 ; Model2 = -0.029
- **Generated**: ModelA = +0.0979 ; ModelB = +0.0126
- **Mismatch**: **Sign is reversed in both models** (and magnitude is off).
- **Fix**: Likely a **coding error**:
  - Hispanic dummy may be inverted (1=non-Hispanic),
  - or you accidentally used a different “ethnic proxy” mapping than the paper,
  - or the reference categories are not mutually exclusive (overlap with race variables).
  Ensure Hispanic is coded consistently with the paper (Hispanic indicator independent of race, if that’s how Bryson did it), and check for overlap/multicollinearity created by your construction.

#### Other race
- **True**: Model1 = -0.017 ; Model2 = 0.047
- **Generated**: ModelA = +0.0710 ; ModelB = +0.1009
- **Mismatch**: Model1 sign differs; Model2 magnitude much larger.
- **Fix**: Re-check race category construction and ensure “Other” excludes Black and Hispanic the same way the paper does.

#### Conservative Protestant
- **True**: Model1 = 0.063 ; Model2 = 0.048
- **Generated**: ModelA = 0.1118 ; ModelB = 0.0654
- **Mismatch**: Both are larger than true.
- **Fix**: Your “proxy; source=relig+denom16” may not replicate Bryson’s classification. Use the same denomination coding scheme Bryson used; avoid ad-hoc proxy mappings.

#### No religion
- **True**: Model1 = 0.057 ; Model2 = 0.024
- **Generated**: ModelA = 0.0776 ; ModelB = 0.0676
- **Mismatch**: Model2 especially is far larger than true.
- **Fix**: Confirm RELIG==4 corresponds to “None” in the same codebook/year Bryson used, and that you aren’t mixing survey years or recodes.

#### Southern
- **True**: Model1 = 0.024 ; Model2 = 0.069
- **Generated**: ModelA = -0.0500 ; ModelB = 0.1164
- **Mismatch**: Model1 sign reversed; Model2 too large.
- **Fix**: REGION==3 may not correspond to “South” in your data (GSS region codes often differ by labeling). Verify region coding; ensure South dummy is correct and reference category matches.

---

### 4) “Standard errors” issue (and why your stars are not comparable)

**Mismatch C1 — The true table does not report SEs**
- **True**: Bryson Table 2 reports standardized coefficients and stars only; **no standard errors**.
- **Generated**: You report significance stars, implying you computed SEs/t-tests from your own model.
- **Why this is a mismatch**: Even if your coefficients matched, your computed stars can still disagree if you do not replicate Bryson’s exact variance estimator (weights, design effects, etc.) and sample.
- **Fix**:
  - Do not claim agreement/disagreement in SEs because the “true” table has none.
  - To match stars, replicate the exact model (including weights and sample). If you cannot, present **coefficients only** and state stars are from your model, not the paper.

---

### 5) Major structural problem: your regression sample is collapsing due to missingness

Your missingness tables show extremely high missingness on key predictors:
- racism_score missing **47.6%**
- cons_prot missing **35.7%**
- hispanic missing **22.3%**

With listwise deletion, this can easily shrink N to ~274/266 (exactly what you see). Bryson’s N is 644/605, so he either had:
- much less missingness (different construction), and/or
- different exclusion rules, and/or
- different imputation/recoding of “don’t know/refused,” and/or
- used variables available for more respondents.

**Fix** (to match Bryson):
1. **Rebuild variables** exactly as Bryson did (especially racism_score and Conservative Protestant). The “proxy” approach is a red flag: it often creates missing where the original coding would not.
2. Ensure all GSS-style missing codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) are converted to NA appropriately *before* scale construction—otherwise your scale can become missing unnecessarily.
3. Apply the paper’s **analytic sample** criteria (year(s), age restrictions, etc.).
4. If Bryson used imputation or a “missing” category for some predictors (common in older sociology papers), do the same; otherwise your N will not match.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatch: “minority-linked genres”

**Mismatch D1 — Interpretive framing differs from the paper’s wording**
- **Generated interpretation implied by label**: “minority-linked genres”
- **True**: Footnote is specific: “Genres disproportionately liked by Hispanic or Black respondents.”
- **Fix**: Use Bryson’s phrasing and operationalization. “Minority-linked” is broader and can be read as a theoretical claim rather than the descriptive criterion used to choose the six genres.

---

## What you should change so the generated analysis matches Bryson Table 2

1. **Use the same variables and codings** as the paper (not proxies), especially:
   - racism score construction,
   - Conservative Protestant classification,
   - Hispanic and race dummies,
   - South dummy (region code verification),
   - PRESTG80 direction and missing handling.
2. **Replicate the sample** so N ≈ 644 and 605:
   - same survey year(s),
   - same inclusion criteria,
   - same missing-data handling strategy as Bryson.
3. **Standardization**:
   - Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. Ensure you are producing the same (either standardize all variables prior to OLS or use a method that yields identical beta coefficients).
4. **Report format**:
   - Drop any claim about matching **standard errors** (the true table doesn’t provide them).
   - If you include stars, clarify they come from your replication and will only match if the model/sample/SE method matches.

If you share your code (or at least the exact recodes for racism_score, cons_prot, hispanic, southern, and how you handled missing codes and weights), I can pinpoint which construction is producing the sign flips (especially Hispanic, PRESTG80, and Southern) and the N collapse.
