Score: 31/100
============================================================

### 1) Immediate structural problem: your generated tables are missing variable names (and appear mis-ordered)
- **Mismatch:** `ModelA_table` and `ModelB_table` list only coefficients (plus stars), with a blank/`NaN` row, but **no variable labels**. The true table has 13 rows (12 predictors + constant) with explicit names.
- **Why it matters:** Without names, you can’t verify which coefficient corresponds to which predictor, and it’s easy to mis-attribute effects.
- **Fix:** Rebuild the output as a labeled table with the exact variable order used in Bryson’s Table 2:
  1. Racism score  
  2. Education  
  3. Household income per capita  
  4. Occupational prestige  
  5. Female  
  6. Age  
  7. Black  
  8. Hispanic  
  9. Other race  
  10. Conservative Protestant  
  11. No religion  
  12. Southern  
  13. Constant  

Also remove the `NaN` row (see #4).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (Model 1 vs your ModelA)
Assuming your `ModelA_table` is meant to match **True Model 1**, the coefficients do not match Table 2.

Below I align your sequence (row 1–13, ignoring the `NaN` placeholder) against the true values by the *likely intended order*. Every row is off:

| Predictor (true order) | True coef (Model 1) | Generated coef (ModelA) | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.139* | wrong value; wrong sig level |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.261*** | wrong value (too negative) |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | close but not exact |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.030 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.026 | wrong magnitude |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.191*** | wrong magnitude |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.127* | wrong sig level (*** → *) |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | 0.004 | wrong sign/magnitude |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.079 | wrong sign/magnitude |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.063 | (missing/NaN issue) | your table structure breaks here |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.022 | wrong magnitude |
| Southern | 0.024 | 2.654*** | clearly mis-mapped (this is your constant) |
| Constant | 2.415*** | (not properly aligned) | constant is wrong and shifted |

**Fixes:**
1. **Use the correct dataset and model specification** (see Section 6). The pattern of errors (sign flips, large shifts) suggests you did not reproduce Bryson’s exact construction of DV(s) and predictors.
2. **Standardize variables correctly** (Table 2 reports *standardized coefficients*). If you ran unstandardized OLS, coefficients won’t match.
3. **Ensure the same coding of dummies** (Female, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern). Different reference categories or coding will change coefficients.

---

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (Model 2 vs your ModelB)
Assuming `ModelB_table` corresponds to **True Model 2**, again essentially everything differs.

| Predictor (true order) | True coef (Model 2) | Generated coef (ModelB) | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.005 | wrong sign/magnitude |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.224*** | not equal (closer, but still off) |
| HH income pc | -0.065 | -0.095 | wrong magnitude |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.012 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.091 | wrong magnitude |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.091 | wrong magnitude; lost significance |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.112 | wrong magnitude |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | 0.132* | wrong sign; wrong significance |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.080 | wrong magnitude |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.048 | (NaN shift again) | structural misalignment |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.142** | wrong magnitude; wrong significance |
| Southern | 0.069 | 5.674*** | mis-mapped constant again |
| Constant | 7.860 | (not properly aligned) | constant wrong and shifted |

**Fixes:** Same as Model 1: correct DV construction, standardization, dummy coding, and table assembly.

### 4) The `NaN` row indicates a dropped/misaligned predictor (and your Fit output confirms it)
- **Mismatch:** Both generated models show a blank/`NaN` row in the coefficient table. Fit output says: `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: no_religion`.
- **True table includes “No religion”** with nonzero coefficients in both models (0.057; 0.024).
- **Interpretation:** In your analytic sample, `no_religion` had **no variation** (all 0s or all 1s), so the software dropped it. That *cannot* be true in the GSS 1993 sample Bryson used—so you are not using the same sample or not coding religion the same way.

**Fix:**
- Check your `no_religion` construction:
  - Verify it’s not created as a constant by mistake (e.g., `no_religion = (religion != "None")` instead of `==`).
  - Verify missing values aren’t recoded to 0/1 in a way that collapses variation.
- Check sample restrictions: you may have filtered the data to a subgroup where “no religion” is absent.
- After fixing, rerun; the `NaN` row should disappear and “No religion” should appear with a coefficient.

---

### 5) Sample size and fit statistics do not match (major mismatch)
**True:**
- Model 1: **N=644**, R²=.145, Adj R²=.129
- Model 2: **N=605**, R²=.147, Adj R²=.130

**Generated:**
- ModelA: **n=327**, R²≈.190, Adj R²≈.164
- ModelB: **n=308**, R²≈.166, Adj R²≈.138

**Fix:**
- You are using roughly **half** the intended sample. To match Bryson:
  - Use **GSS 1993** (not pooled years unless the paper did).
  - Apply the same missing-data handling as the author. If you used listwise deletion with additional variables not in the model (or stricter cleaning), N will shrink.
  - Ensure the DVs are constructed from the same genre-like/dislike items; missingness on those items will also cut N.

---

### 6) The dependent variables almost certainly do not match Bryson’s construction
The true models use two specific DVs:
1. **Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin** (6 genres)
2. **Dislike of the remaining 12 genres**

If you instead used:
- different genre groupings,
- a different scoring scheme (count vs mean vs index),
- different handling of “don’t know,” “not asked,” or “never heard,”
then coefficients and N will change.

**Fix:**
- Recreate the DV exactly:
  - Confirm which response category counts as “dislike.”
  - Sum the number of genres disliked in each set (the table title says “number of music genres disliked”).
  - Handle missing genre responses in the same way as the paper (often listwise across the genre items used for that DV).

---

### 7) Standardization mismatch (Table 2 reports standardized betas)
- **Mismatch:** The true results are *standardized OLS coefficients*. Your generated output looks like raw regression output (and includes a constant that’s not comparable to standardized betas anyway).
- **Fix:**
  - Standardize continuous predictors **and the DV** (or use software that reports standardized betas).
  - Keep dummy variables as 0/1 (standardizing dummies is possible but not typically what “standardized OLS coefficients” implies in sociology tables; Bryson’s table appears to report standardized coefficients for all predictors, but you need to match the paper’s method—many authors standardize all variables including binaries).
  - If you standardize DV and predictors, the intercept should be ~0; Bryson still reports a nonzero constant, which suggests *not everything is standardized in the way you assumed* or the “standardized” label applies to slopes only (common in reporting). To match the paper, replicate *their exact standardization convention*.

---

### 8) Standard errors: your generated output implicitly suggests SEs/significance, but the true table does not provide SEs
- **Mismatch:** The true results explicitly note: **no SEs are reported** in Table 2. Your generated output includes stars (which is fine) but if elsewhere you claimed SEs or tried to “extract” them, that would be incorrect.
- **Fix:** Do **not** claim you extracted SEs from Table 2. If you want SEs, you must compute them from the data (and then your table will no longer be “Table 2 as printed,” but “replication with SEs”).

---

### 9) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars do not align)
Examples:
- True Model 1 racism: **0.130** (**) but generated shows **0.139** (*)
- True Model 1 Black: **-0.132*** but generated **-0.127***? (your table shows only `*`)
- True Model 2 Age: **0.126** (**) but generated 0.091 (no stars)

**Fix:**
- Once coefficients and N match, recompute p-values with the correct standard errors (from your regression) and apply the paper’s thresholds (*, **, ***).
- Also confirm two-tailed tests and same alpha cutoffs as reported.

---

## What to do to make the generated analysis match the true table
1. **Recreate the two DVs exactly** (6 “Black/Hispanic-liked” genres vs remaining 12), counted as “number disliked.”
2. **Use the correct GSS 1993 sample** and replicate the paper’s missing-data rules to reach **N=644** and **N=605**.
3. **Code predictors identically** (especially religion categories and region), ensuring `no_religion` varies and is not dropped.
4. **Match the paper’s standardization convention** for “standardized OLS coefficients.”
5. **Output a labeled table in the correct row order** and remove placeholder/`NaN` rows.
6. **Do not claim SEs are extracted from Table 2**; compute them only if you are doing a replication beyond the printed table.

If you share (a) the variable mapping you intended for each generated row, and (b) how you constructed the two DV indices and religion dummies, I can pinpoint exactly which recode/standardization step is causing each sign flip and the N cut in half.
