Score: 0/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / construct mismatches (and fixes)

1) **Model labels don’t match the paper**
- **Generated:** “ModelA” and “ModelB”.
- **True:** “Model 1” and “Model 2”.
- **Fix:** Rename ModelA→Model 1; ModelB→Model 2 in all tables/figures.

2) **Dependent-variable wording differs (and one is wrong in a substantive way)**
- **Generated DV1:** “Dislike of minority-linked genres (count of 6)”
- **True DV1:** “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”
- **Generated DV2:** “Dislike of remaining genres (count of 12)”
- **True DV2:** “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”
- **Fix:** Use the *exact genre list text* from the table. If you are constructing indices, explicitly state it reproduces Bryson’s index (same genres, same coding, same range). Right now your DV label implies a simple count; that may not reproduce her DV construction and will change coefficients/N.

3) **Hispanic variable is not the same construct**
- **Generated:** “Hispanic (derived from ETHNIC via cautious mapping)”
- **True:** “Hispanic”
- **Issue:** Your “cautious mapping” is an *author-created proxy*, not necessarily what Bryson used. Even small recode differences alter coefficients and N.
- **Fix:** Recode Hispanic exactly as in the original study (same source variable(s), same inclusion/exclusion rules). If using GSS, replicate Bryson’s year(s) and coding decisions; don’t invent a mapping.

4) **Conservative Protestant is a proxy, not the table’s measure**
- **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1; missing preserved)”
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant”
- **Issue:** Conservative Protestant in Bryson (1996) is typically based on denominational/fundamentalist classification schemes, not RELIG==1 & DENOM==1.
- **Fix:** Implement the same classification Bryson used (or the same published scheme she cites). Your proxy will misclassify respondents and distort coefficients.

5) **“No religion” incorrectly dropped**
- **Generated:** No religion is **NaN / dropped (no variation in analytic sample)** in both models.
- **True:** No religion has coefficients in both models (Model1=0.057, Model2=0.024).
- **Fix:** This is a hard mismatch indicating your analytic sample or coding is wrong. Common causes:
  - You filtered to a subsample where RELIG==4 never occurs (coding mistake or over-restriction).
  - You treated “no religion” as missing everywhere, then created a dummy that becomes all 0.
  - You accidentally subset to Protestants only (e.g., via cons_prot construction).
  - You recoded RELIG values incorrectly.
  - **Correction:** verify RELIG coding, don’t drop non-variant dummies if the original analysis had variation; replicate Bryson’s sample years and inclusion criteria so “no religion” exists.

6) **South variable definition likely wrong**
- **Generated:** “Southern (REGION==3)”
- **True:** “Southern”
- **Issue:** REGION codes vary by dataset/year; REGION==3 may not correspond to “South” in Bryson’s data.
- **Fix:** Confirm which numeric code represents “South” and replicate Bryson’s binary South definition.

7) **Race dummies likely miscoded**
- **Generated:** Black (RACE==2), Other race (RACE==3)
- **True:** Black, Other race
- **Issue:** Race coding differs across GSS years (and “Other” often includes multiple categories). Your “Other” in Model 2 is significant and large (0.122*), but true is small (0.047) and not significant.
- **Fix:** Recreate race dummies exactly as Bryson did (White reference; Black dummy; Hispanic separate; “Other” includes Asian/Native/etc. depending on original coding).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (every variable)

Below I list **Generated vs True** standardized coefficients (β). Any mismatch is a discrepancy.

#### Model 1 (DV: 6 genres)
- Racism: **0.140** vs **0.130** (and sig mismatch: * vs **)
- Education: **-0.260** vs **-0.175**
- Income pc: **-0.012** vs **-0.037**
- Occ prestige: **0.058** vs **-0.020** (sign flip)
- Female: **-0.034** vs **-0.057**
- Age: **0.175** vs **0.163** (sig mismatch: ** vs ***)
- Black: **-0.177** vs **-0.132** (sig mismatch: * vs ***)
- Hispanic: **-0.007** vs **-0.058**
- Other race: **-0.005** vs **-0.017**
- Conservative Protestant: **0.120** vs **0.063**
- No religion: **dropped/NaN** vs **0.057**
- Southern: **-0.059** vs **0.024** (sign flip)
- Constant: **2.593** vs **2.415**

#### Model 2 (DV: other 12 genres)
- Racism: **-0.013** vs **0.080** (sign flip and magnitude)
- Education: **-0.165** vs **-0.242**
- Income pc: **-0.077** vs **-0.065**
- Occ prestige: **-0.079** vs **0.005** (sign flip)
- Female: **-0.082** vs **-0.070**
- Age: **0.127** vs **0.126** (sig mismatch: * vs **)
- Black: **0.039** vs **0.042**
- Hispanic: **-0.023** vs **-0.029**
- Other race: **0.122** vs **0.047** (and sig mismatch: * vs none)
- Conservative Protestant: **0.142** vs **0.048** (big mismatch; and sig mismatch: * vs none)
- No religion: **dropped/NaN** vs **0.024**
- Southern: **0.104** vs **0.069**
- Constant: **5.185** vs **7.860** (large mismatch)

**Fix for coefficient mismatches (global):** you must replicate *all* of the following simultaneously; any one difference can move many coefficients, but your pattern (sign flips + large constant/N differences) strongly suggests multiple problems:
- Same data source and year range as Bryson (1996)
- Same sample restrictions (age, valid responses, listwise deletion rules)
- Same DV construction (which genres, how “dislike” is coded, whether it’s summed/standardized)
- Same independent variable coding (especially religion and region)
- Same model type: OLS with standardized coefficients

### 3) Standard errors: reported vs not reported

- **Generated:** You don’t show SEs in the summary tables, but the prompt asks to check SEs. Also your significance stars imply you computed p-values, which requires SEs/t-stats.
- **True:** Table 2 **does not report standard errors**; it reports standardized coefficients and stars only.
- **Mismatch:** Any “SE” values (if present elsewhere in your pipeline) are not comparable to the table because the table doesn’t present them; also your stars do not match Bryson’s stars.
- **Fix:** If your goal is to “match the table,” output **only** standardized betas with the same star cutpoints. If you still compute SEs internally, don’t present them as “Table 2 replication,” and ensure stars come from the same test (two-tailed, same df, same handling of weights/design).

---

### 4) Fit statistics and N mismatches

- **Model 1 N:** **Generated 261** vs **True 644**
- **Model 2 N:** **Generated 259** vs **True 605**
- **Model 1 R²:** **Generated 0.178** vs **True 0.145**
- **Model 2 R²:** **Generated 0.151** vs **True 0.147**
- **Adj R²:** Generated differs from true in both models.
- **Fix:** Your N is far too small, indicating you are not using Bryson’s analytic sample. To fix:
  1) Use the same survey years and dataset Bryson used.
  2) Apply the same missing-data handling (likely listwise deletion, but on the correct variables).
  3) Ensure your genre variables exist and are coded; your construction may be eliminating most respondents.
  4) If weights were used, apply them as Bryson did (and note: weighting doesn’t change N but affects SEs/stars and sometimes R² reporting conventions).

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches implied by the generated output

1) **Calling the DV a “count” may be an interpretive error**
- If Bryson’s DV is not a simple count of disliked genres (e.g., if it’s a scale or uses specific cutpoints), then interpreting coefficients as “per additional disliked genre” is wrong.
- **Fix:** Match DV construction; then interpret as Bryson’s DV (unit/range consistent).

2) **“Dropped (no variation)” is not just a technical note; it changes the model**
- Dropping “No religion” changes the meaning of other religion coefficients (reference group composition changes).
- **Fix:** Don’t proceed with a “replication” table if a key covariate is absent; repair coding/sample until it varies.

---

### 6) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996)

1) **Data & years**
- Identify exact dataset and years Bryson used; subset accordingly.

2) **Rebuild DVs exactly**
- DV1: rap, reggae, blues/R&B, jazz, gospel, latin music dislike index as Bryson defined.
- DV2: dislike of the other 12 genres, same coding.

3) **Recode IVs exactly**
- Racism scale: same items, same scoring (0–5), same handling of DK/NA.
- Education: years (confirm top-coding if any).
- Income per capita: confirm formula and inflation-adjustment decisions.
- Prestige: confirm measure (PRESTG80 is plausible but ensure it matches her prestige variable and missing rules).
- Female, Age: straightforward but confirm coding.
- Race/ethnicity: replicate her categories precisely.
- Conservative Protestant: implement her scheme, not RELIG/DENOM shortcut.
- No religion: correct RELIG coding and ensure it is included.
- Southern: correct region definition.

4) **Modeling**
- OLS with standardized coefficients. Standardize variables the same way she did (typically standardize Xs and Y, or use software option that returns standardized betas).
- Stars: two-tailed p-values with the same thresholds.

5) **Output formatting**
- Remove standard errors from the “Table 2 replication” output (since true table omits them).
- Use exact variable labels and DV titles from the paper.

If you provide the code you used to (a) build the two DVs and (b) create “cons_prot,” “no_religion,” and “southern,” I can pinpoint which specific recode/filter is driving the huge N loss and the “no religion” drop.
