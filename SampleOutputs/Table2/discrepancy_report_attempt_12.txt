============================================================

### 1) Fundamental reporting/format mismatches (make the outputs comparable first)

**Mismatch 1.1 — Wrong estimand shown (unstandardized vs standardized)**
- **Generated tables** show `coef` (unstandardized) *and* `std_beta` (standardized).
- **True Table 2** reports **standardized coefficients only** (betas) plus significance markers.
- **Fix:** For comparison to Bryson Table 2, **report only standardized coefficients** (your `std_beta`) and the sig stars based on the paper’s thresholds. If you want to keep unstandardized coefficients, put them in a separate appendix—not in the table being compared to Table 2.

**Mismatch 1.2 — Standard errors should not be present**
- **Generated**: includes standard errors implicitly via p-values, and the table claims SE-like inference.
- **True**: **no SEs are reported in the PDF table**, so you cannot “match” SEs from Table 2.
- **Fix:** Remove SEs/p-values from the “match-to-paper” table, or explicitly label them as **computed from your own re-estimation** (which still won’t match the published table unless the same sample/coding is used). If your goal is to match the published table, output: `std_beta` + stars only.

**Mismatch 1.3 — Sample sizes and fit statistics don’t match**
- **Generated Model A**: N=327, R²=.1896 (Adj .1639)
- **True Model 1**: N=644, R²=.145 (Adj .129)
- **Generated Model B**: N=308, R²=.1658 (Adj .1377)
- **True Model 2**: N=605, R²=.147 (Adj .130)
- **Fix:** Your analysis is using about **half the sample**. To match the paper you must reproduce the **1993 GSS** sample and Bryson’s exclusions/coding:
  - Use the correct survey year (1993) and the same inclusion criteria.
  - Ensure the DV construction uses the same set of genres and same missing-data handling.
  - Use listwise deletion (most likely) in a way that yields N=644 and N=605 for the two DVs.
  - Confirm weights (if the paper used any—Table 2 often is unweighted unless noted).

**Mismatch 1.4 — Variable name alignment is missing**
- Generated tables have **no row labels**, so you can’t verify which coefficient corresponds to which predictor.
- **Fix:** Add explicit row names in the exact order of the paper:  
  Racism, Education, Income per capita, Occ prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Constant.

### 2) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (using your `std_beta` vs the paper’s standardized coefficients)

Below I compare **paper’s standardized coefficient** to the **closest matching generated `std_beta`** (assuming the order of rows matches the paper: constant first, then predictors). Because your table has unlabeled rows and NaN rows, this mapping is uncertain—this is itself a discrepancy (see 1.4). Still, the numbers show clear non-matches.

## Model A (paper Model 1: “Dislike of Rap…Latin”; true N=644)
**True standardized betas (selected):**
- Racism **0.130**  
- Education **-0.175**  
- Income **-0.037**  
- Occ prestige **-0.020**  
- Female **-0.057**  
- Age **0.163**  
- Black **-0.132**  
- Hispanic **-0.058**  
- Other race **-0.017**  
- Cons Prot **0.063**  
- No religion **0.057**  
- Southern **0.024**  
- Constant 2.415 (not standardized)

**Generated ModelA_table problems:**
- **Constant**: generated unstandardized constant **2.654** vs true **2.415** (doesn’t match).
- **Racism**: your only plausible positive standardized betas are **0.1395** and **0.1912**; neither equals **0.130** and the larger one is far off.
- **Education**: you have a large negative standardized beta **-0.2609**, whereas true is **-0.175** (too large in magnitude).
- **Age**: true is **+0.163**; you have **+0.1912** (closer, but still notably different).
- **Black**: true is **-0.132**; your negative race-ish candidate **-0.1272** is close, but your **p-value is .025** (paper has ***), indicating a major mismatch in sample/SE/coding.
- **Income, prestige, female, Hispanic, other race, religion, southern**: your near-zero standardized betas (e.g., -0.034, 0.03, -0.026, 0.004, 0.079, 0.022) do not line up well with the paper’s pattern and signs in several cases, but without row labels we can’t assign them reliably.

**Fixes for Model A to match the paper**
1. **Recreate the DV exactly**: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin” as a **count** with the same “dislike” definition and missing handling.
2. **Recreate the racism scale** exactly (items, direction, standardization).
3. **Use the same coding** for demographic dummies (Black/Hispanic/Other race), religious tradition, South, gender, etc.
4. **Get N up to 644** by matching the paper’s inclusion rules and not accidentally restricting to a subset (e.g., complete cases on extra variables not in the paper, or filtering out respondents with any genre missing beyond what Bryson did).

## Model B (paper Model 2: “12 remaining genres”; true N=605)

**True standardized betas (selected):**
- Racism **0.080** (ns)
- Education **-0.242***  
- Income **-0.065**  
- Occ prestige **0.005**  
- Female **-0.070**  
- Age **0.126**  
- Black **0.042**  
- Hispanic **-0.029**  
- Other race **0.047**  
- Cons Prot **0.048**  
- No religion **0.024**  
- Southern **0.069**  
- Constant 7.860

**Generated ModelB_table issues:**
- **Constant**: generated **5.674** vs true **7.860** (large mismatch).
- **Racism**: you appear to have a tiny negative standardized beta **-0.0051** (ns), but the paper reports **+0.080** (ns). Sign mismatch.
- **Education**: you have **-0.2238** (sign correct, magnitude somewhat close to -0.242).
- **Age**: you have **+0.0914** (paper: +0.126**), too small and wrong significance.
- **Southern**: you have a significant positive beta **0.1424** (**), whereas paper is **0.069** (ns/only *not marked as significant in the excerpt). This is a big magnitude/significance mismatch.
- **Conservative Protestant**: your table shows a significant positive **0.1321***ish (p=.016) in one of the later rows; paper is **0.048** (ns). Another big mismatch.
- Several other signs/magnitudes don’t line up, but again row-label absence prevents definitive mapping.

**Fixes for Model B**
Same as Model A, plus:
- Ensure the “12 remaining genres” DV uses **exactly the complement set** of genres and identical dislike coding.
- Do not introduce extra missingness by requiring all 18 genre items when Bryson may have constructed counts with a different missing rule (e.g., requiring valid responses on the relevant set only).

### 3) Structural problems in your generated tables

**Mismatch 3.1 — “dropped_zero_variance_predictors: no_religion” contradicts the paper**
- Your fit tables say `no_religion` was dropped for zero variance, but the paper reports a coefficient for **No religion** in both models.
- **Fix:** Your “no_religion” variable is likely miscoded (e.g., all 0 due to a recode error, or filtered sample contains no “no religion” respondents). Recompute:
  - Check frequency of `no_religion` before modeling.
  - Verify it’s coded 1/0 and not all missing.
  - Verify sample restrictions didn’t exclude that group.

**Mismatch 3.2 — NaN rows in the coefficient tables**
- Both ModelA_table and ModelB_table have rows of all NaNs, indicating missing parameter names/failed estimation for some predictors.
- **Fix:** Ensure the model matrix is well-formed:
  - Drop or properly encode categorical variables (avoid perfect multicollinearity).
  - Ensure no duplicated columns.
  - Ensure you’re not accidentally inserting separators into the coefficient output.

**Mismatch 3.3 — Interpretation/significance logic differs**
- Your stars are based on your p-values; the paper’s stars reflect p-values from Bryson’s estimation with a different N/coding.
- **Fix:** If your goal is to reproduce Table 2, match the **coefficients and stars** by replicating the dataset/coding. Don’t claim a “match” using different inference.

### 4) What to change in the “generated analysis” so it matches the paper

To make the generated output align with “True Results” specifically:

1. **Produce a Table 2-style output**
   - Columns: standardized coefficient only.
   - Rows: exactly the variables in the paper (with those exact labels).
   - No standard errors (since Table 2 doesn’t include them).
   - Stars: based on your replicated p-values *after* you match N/coding.

2. **Rebuild both DVs exactly as counts**
   - Model 1 DV: count of dislikes among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}.
   - Model 2 DV: count of dislikes among the other 12 genres.
   - Apply the paper’s missing-data rule to reach N=644 and N=605.

3. **Correct the predictors**
   - Recreate **racism score** exactly (same items, direction, scaling).
   - Recreate education, income per capita, occupational prestige, female, age.
   - Race dummies: Black, Hispanic, Other race with White as reference.
   - Religion dummies: Conservative Protestant, No religion (with mainline/other as reference per paper).
   - Southern dummy.

4. **Standardize predictors/outcome the same way Bryson did**
   - “Standardized OLS coefficients” usually means beta weights from regression on original metric but standardized via SDs; verify whether you standardized X and Y prior to estimation or computed betas post hoc. Use the same method consistently.

5. **Add row labels and remove NaNs**
   - Ensure coefficient table rows are named and correspond one-to-one with the paper’s variables.

If you paste your model formula(s), variable coding snippets, and the genre lists used for each DV, I can map each generated row to the intended paper variable and enumerate the exact per-variable sign/magnitude mismatches with certainty.
