============================================================

## 1) Mismatches in variables (names, inclusion, coding)

### A. Hispanic and No religion incorrectly dropped / set to NaN
- **Generated:**  
  - “Hispanic (not in extract; set 0 if race observed)” = **NaN** (and listed as dropped for no variation).  
  - “No religion (RELIG==4)” = **NaN** (dropped).
- **True table:**  
  - **Hispanic is included** in both models (Model 1 = **-0.058**, Model 2 = **-0.029**).  
  - **No religion is included** (Model 1 = **0.057**, Model 2 = **0.024**).

**How to fix**
- Do **not** fabricate Hispanic as “0 if race observed.” That guarantees either miscoding or no variation.
- Recreate race/ethnicity exactly as the paper’s coding:
  - Use mutually exclusive indicators (e.g., **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race**) with **White** as the omitted reference.
  - Ensure **Hispanic is not forced to 0** for everyone (and that it exists in the dataset).
- Recreate religion categories exactly:
  - Create a **No religion** dummy from the same coding Bryson used (not “RELIG==4” unless that is verified to match the paper’s “none” category).
  - If your extract lacks the needed variables, you cannot reproduce Table 2; you must obtain the correct variables/source.

### B. “Conservative Protestant” is not equivalent to “Protestant & Baptist”
- **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy: Protestant & Baptist)”
- **True table:** “Conservative Protestant” (specific definition used in the study)

**How to fix**
- Use the **actual conservative Protestant classification** (typically derived from denominational family coding, not simply “Protestant and Baptist”). Your proxy can materially change coefficients and N (because you’re changing who is coded 1 vs 0 and potentially creating missingness).

---

### C. Outcome variables (DVs) do not match the paper’s construction/sample
- **Generated N:** Model A **340**, Model B **326**
- **True N:** Model 1 **644**, Model 2 **605**

This is not a minor discrepancy; it signals you are not reproducing the same analytic sample and/or not using the same source/year/weighting/missing-data treatment.

**How to fix**
- Confirm you are using the **same dataset and year(s)** as Bryson (1996) and the same restrictions.
- Apply the same **listwise deletion rule** (or whatever the paper used) across the same items.
- Rebuild the DV indices from the correct set of “dislike” indicators and coding rules used in the paper (e.g., how “don’t know,” “never heard,” or refusals are treated).
- If the paper uses weights, apply the same weights.

---

### D. DV descriptives table is malformed / mislabeled
- **Generated `dv_descriptives`:** first column values look like they include **N/sum** (e.g., 1134, 1057) mixed into what should be min/mean/sd/quantiles.
- The paper’s Table 2 does not report these descriptives, but your output appears internally inconsistent.

**How to fix**
- Label rows explicitly (N, mean, sd, min, p25, median, p75, max).  
- Ensure you’re reporting **N**, not the **sum of dislikes**, unless that is intentional and clearly labeled.

## 2) Mismatches in coefficients (standardized betas)

Below, “Generated” refers to ModelA_Std_Beta / ModelB_Std_Beta; “True” refers to Bryson Table 2 standardized OLS coefficients.

### Model 1 (minority-linked 6 genres)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.146 | 0.130** | coefficient too high; sig marking differs (yours **, true **) |
| Education | -0.266 | -0.175*** | too negative (substantially) |
| Income pc | -0.048 | -0.037 | modest difference |
| Prestige | 0.025 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.027 | -0.057 | magnitude off |
| Age | 0.210 | 0.163*** | too high |
| Black | -0.133 * | -0.132*** | coefficient matches, but **significance level wrong** |
| Hispanic | NaN | -0.058 | missing entirely |
| Other race | 0.010 | -0.017 | **wrong sign** |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.071 | 0.063 | close |
| No religion | NaN | 0.057 | missing entirely |
| Southern | 0.017 | 0.024 | close |

**How to fix**
- The sign flips (Prestige, Other race) and the big Education difference strongly suggest: wrong sample, wrong coding, wrong standardization procedure, or wrong DV construction.
- To match Bryson, you must:
  1) use the same analytic N (~644),  
  2) code the same dummies (race/ethnicity, religion),  
  3) construct the DV exactly,  
  4) compute **standardized coefficients** the same way (typically standardizing X and Y before OLS, or using a procedure that produces identical standardized betas).

### Model 2 (remaining 12 genres)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.008 | 0.080 | far too small |
| Education | -0.205 ** | -0.242*** | smaller magnitude; sig level differs |
| Income pc | -0.098 | -0.065 | more negative |
| Prestige | -0.026 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.079 | -0.070 | close |
| Age | 0.132 * | 0.126** | sig level differs |
| Black | 0.092 | 0.042 | too large |
| Hispanic | NaN | -0.029 | missing |
| Other race | 0.116 * | 0.047 | too large; sig likely wrong |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.097 | 0.048 | too large |
| No religion | NaN | 0.024 | missing |
| Southern | 0.121 * | 0.069 | too large; sig differs |

**How to fix**
- Again, the combination of (a) missing predictors, (b) wrong N, and (c) multiple sign/magnitude differences means your model is not the same model.
- Fix the upstream data and coding first; do not try to “patch” coefficients after estimation.

## 3) Mismatches in fit statistics and constants

### A. R² and adjusted R² do not match
- **Generated:** R² = 0.205 (Model A), 0.167 (Model B)
- **True:** R² = 0.145 (Model 1), 0.147 (Model 2)

**How to fix**
- Use the same sample and variable definitions. R² is highly sensitive to sample restrictions and DV construction.

### B. Constant differs (and your constant significance is irrelevant to Table 2 replication)
- **Generated constant:** 2.657*** (Model A), 5.205*** (Model B)
- **True constant:** 2.415*** (Model 1), 7.860 (Model 2; notably the paper lists it without stars)

**How to fix**
- Constants will not align unless (i) DV scaling is identical, (ii) covariate coding and centering/standardization are handled the same way, and (iii) sample matches.
- Also: Table 2 reports standardized coefficients but still prints a constant; ensure you are not mixing a standardized-beta table with a constant estimated under a different transformation.

## 4) Mismatches about standard errors / interpretation

### A. Standard errors: the “true results” have none, but your task asks to compare SEs
- **True Table 2:** explicitly **does not report standard errors**.
- **Generated:** also does **not** report SEs—only standardized betas and significance marks.

**Mismatch to flag**
- Any comparison of **standard errors** is impossible from the provided “True Results.” If you generated SEs elsewhere, they are not shown here; if you didn’t, you can’t claim agreement/disagreement.

**How to fix**
- Either:
  - obtain the original model output (or replication dataset) that includes SEs, **or**
  - restrict comparison strictly to what Table 2 reports: standardized betas, N, R², adjusted R².

### B. Interpretation/significance mismatches
- **Black (Model 1):** generated shows `*`, true shows `***` (big discrepancy)
- **Age (Model 2):** generated `*`, true `**`
- **Education (Model 2):** generated `**`, true `***`

**How to fix**
- Once you replicate the correct sample and measures, compute p-values using the same approach (OLS assumptions, two-tailed tests).
- If the paper used weights or complex survey design corrections, you must match that; otherwise significance stars will differ even if coefficients are close.

---

## 5) The biggest root causes (why your generated results can’t match as-is)

1) **Wrong analytic sample (N ~340 vs 644/605)** due to extreme missingness:
   - Your racism_score missingness ~0.48 and cons_prot ~0.36 will massively shrink N under listwise deletion.
2) **Key predictors missing (Hispanic, No religion)**
3) **Proxy coding for conservative Protestant**
4) **Likely DV construction differences** and/or handling of “missing” music items
5) **Possibly different dataset/year/weights**

---

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1) **Use the correct source data** (same survey/year and variables as Bryson 1996).
2) **Rebuild race/ethnicity** dummies to include Hispanic and ensure White is the reference.
3) **Rebuild religion** including “No religion” using the paper’s coding.
4) **Rebuild Conservative Protestant** with the denominational-family definition used by Bryson (not Protestant&Baptist).
5) **Reconstruct both DVs** exactly from the same genre dislike items and the same missing-data rules.
6) Apply the same **missing-data approach** as the paper (likely listwise deletion, but on the correctly constructed variables; if the paper used imputation or different handling of “never heard,” match it).
7) Verify you reproduce **N (644/605)** first; then check coefficients; then check R²/Adj R²; then check significance stars (if you can reproduce the same SE assumptions).

If you share (a) the exact code used to build racism_score, the two DV counts, and the race/religion dummies, I can point to the exact lines that are causing the sign flips and the N collapse.
