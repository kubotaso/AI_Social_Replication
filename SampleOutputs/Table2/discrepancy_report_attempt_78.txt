============================================================

## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### A. Missing variable: **Hispanic**
- **True table:** includes **Hispanic** in both models (Model 1 = −0.058; Model 2 = −0.029).
- **Generated results:** no Hispanic row anywhere; the analytic samples also lack a `hispanic` column.
- **Fix:** create/include a Hispanic indicator exactly as Bryson does.
  - If race/ethnicity is mutually exclusive categories, you need dummies for **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race**, with **White non-Hispanic** as the reference.
  - Implementation: add `hispanic` to the design matrix and refit both models.

### B. “Other race” coefficient sign mismatch suggests dummy coding differences
- **True Model 1:** Other race = **−0.017**
- **Generated Model 1:** Other race = **+0.010867**
- **Fix:** ensure the “other race” dummy matches Bryson’s definition and reference category. Common pitfalls:
  - Treating Hispanic as “other race” (because Hispanic missing).
  - Using a different baseline (e.g., White vs. non-Black).
  - Coding “other race” as 1 for everyone not White (instead of a specific category).
  - After adding `hispanic`, recode `other_race` to exclude Hispanic.

### C. “Age” naming inconsistency (minor)
- **True:** “Age”
- **Generated tables:** “Age” but analytic sample uses `age_years`.
- **Fix:** purely cosmetic: map `age_years` → “Age” in output labels (this doesn’t change estimates).

### D. “Constant” in Model 2 is treated like a normal coefficient
- **True table:** Constant shown as **7.860** (and notably *not* starred in the transcription you provided).
- **Generated:** Constant = **4.957739***.
- **Fix:** refit the model with the same DV construction, scaling, and sample as Bryson (constant is a strong diagnostic that something foundational differs—see sections 2 and 3).

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (by variable)

Below I list **Generated vs True** and the direction of mismatch.

### Model 1 (Minority-linked genres: 6)
| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.131833** | close (OK) |
| Education | −0.175*** | −0.180139*** | slightly more negative |
| Household income per capita | **−0.037** | **+0.008961** | **wrong sign** |
| Occupational prestige | −0.020 | −0.019019 | close (OK) |
| Female | −0.057 | −0.071658 | too negative |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.156851*** | slightly smaller |
| Black | −0.132*** | −0.141030** | significance + magnitude mismatch |
| Hispanic | −0.058 | **missing** | omitted variable |
| Other race | −0.017 | +0.010867 | wrong sign |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.083766 | too large |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.068263 | too large |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.026711 | close (OK) |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.461148*** | too high |

**Interpretation implication:** With income having the wrong sign and Hispanic omitted, the generated substantive story about socioeconomic position and minority-linked dislikes will not match Bryson’s.

### Model 2 (Remaining genres: 12)
| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.080** | **−0.002233** | **wrong sign and near zero** |
| Education | −0.242*** | −0.194316*** | too small in magnitude |
| Household income per capita | −0.065 | −0.035654 | too small in magnitude |
| Occupational prestige | **0.005** | **−0.012431** | wrong sign |
| Female | −0.070 | −0.069205 | close (OK) |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.119317** | close (OK) |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.066914 | too large |
| Hispanic | −0.029 | **missing** | omitted variable |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.076128 | too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.101269* | much too large + stars mismatch |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.018895 | close (OK) |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.075385 | close (OK) |
| Constant | 7.860 | 4.957739*** | way off |

**Interpretation implication:** Your generated Model 2 effectively concludes racism has no relationship (slightly negative), whereas Bryson reports a positive association (0.080). That is a major substantive mismatch.

## 3) Model fit / sample-size mismatches (these are big)

### A. N differs a lot
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605.
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=549; Model 2 N=507.
- **Fix:** replicate Bryson’s sample restrictions and missing-data handling.
  - Bryson likely uses listwise deletion across variables used in *that* model, but your N is far smaller, implying additional missingness from your constructed variables (income_pc, occ_prestige, religion, region, etc.) or extra filters.
  - Steps:
    1. Start from the same survey/wave Bryson used.
    2. Match eligibility (age range? respondents with music questions?).
    3. Recreate all predictors exactly.
    4. Apply **listwise deletion only after** variables are created (and only for variables in the given model).
    5. Confirm N hits 644 and 605.

### B. R² and Adjusted R² do not match
- **True:** R²=0.145 (M1), 0.147 (M2); Adj R²=0.129 (M1), 0.130 (M2).
- **Generated:** R²=0.133 (M1), 0.120 (M2); Adj R²=0.115 (M1), 0.100 (M2).
- **Fix:** Once DV construction + standardization + sample match, R² should move toward Bryson’s. Persistently lower R² often indicates:
  - different DV (count vs something else),
  - different scaling,
  - missing a key predictor (here: **Hispanic**),
  - measurement differences in “racism score,” income, prestige.

## 4) Standard errors: required by the prompt, but not available in the “true” table

- **True Results statement:** Table 2 **does not report standard errors**.
- **Generated Results:** also do **not** report SEs (only coefficients + stars).
- **Mismatch:** none can be directly checked because the “true” SEs are unknown.
- **Fix (to “match” Bryson):**
  - Do **not** claim you matched SEs or t-stats.
  - If you want SEs in your output, label them as **from your replication dataset**, and do not compare them to Bryson’s Table 2.

---

## 5) Interpretation / labeling mismatches

### A. “Std_Beta” vs intercept shown
- **True:** coefficients are standardized OLS betas, **but constant is unstandardized** (Bryson still reports it).
- **Generated:** column labeled `Std_Beta`, but includes **Constant** as “intercept (unstandardized)” (good), yet the rest of the pipeline may be mixing standardized and unstandardized models.
- **Fix:** ensure the workflow is:
  1. Fit OLS on **unstandardized** variables (to get the intercept right), then compute standardized betas post-hoc **or**
  2. Standardize DV and all X’s (z-scores) and fit without intercept issues (but then intercept should be ~0, which won’t match Bryson’s reported constant).
  
  To match Bryson’s presentation, do (1): **unstandardized regression + standardized coefficients reported**.

### B. Significance stars mismatching
Examples:
- **Model 1 Black:** True has ***; Generated has **.
- **Model 2 Conservative Protestant:** True has no star; Generated has *.
- **Fix:** once N, coefficients, and the exact SE computation (survey weights? design effects?) match, stars will align better. Also ensure:
  - two-tailed tests,
  - same alpha thresholds,
  - same variance estimator (plain OLS vs robust vs survey-adjusted).

## What you need to change so the generated analysis matches Bryson (checklist)

1. **Add Hispanic dummy** (and ensure race dummies are mutually exclusive) with White non-Hispanic as reference.
2. **Rebuild the DVs exactly** as Bryson:
   - confirm which genres are in the “minority-linked 6” and the “remaining 12,”
   - confirm whether “dislike” is coded identically (e.g., top-box only? reversed scale?).
3. **Match the sample (N=644, 605)**:
   - use the same dataset/wave,
   - apply the same inclusion criteria,
   - use listwise deletion consistent with Bryson.
4. **Compute standardized betas the same way Bryson does**:
   - fit unstandardized OLS,
   - transform coefficients to standardized betas using SDs from the analytic sample.
5. **Match inference choices** (for stars):
   - verify whether Bryson used weights and/or survey design corrections,
   - use two-tailed p-values with the same thresholds.
6. Re-run and verify these diagnostics in order: **N → constants → key coefficients (income, racism, education) → R²/Adj R² → stars**.

If you paste your code (or at least how you constructed: racism_score, income_pc, race/ethnicity dummies, and the two DVs), I can pinpoint exactly which construction step is driving the wrong signs (especially income in Model 1 and racism/prestige in Model 2).
