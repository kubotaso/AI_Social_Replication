============================================================

## 1) Fundamental reporting mismatch (what the table is vs what you generated)

### A. You generated **unstandardized coefficients + SEs**, but the “true” table reports **standardized coefficients only**
- **Generated**: `b_unstd`, `beta_std`, `std_err`, `t`, `p_value`.
- **True (Bryson Table 2)**: standardized coefficients (betas) + significance stars; **no SEs**.

**Fix**
- If your goal is to match Table 2, you must:
  1) report **only standardized coefficients** (your `beta_std`), and  
  2) **remove** standard errors/t/p-values (or clearly label them as *not from Table 2*).
- Alternatively, if you want to keep SEs, you must compute them from the microdata and then you are **no longer “replicating Table 2 exactly”**—you’re producing an expanded output. But you still must match the standardized betas and N/R².

### B. You treated “No religion” as all zeros (perfectly predicted / dropped)
- **Generated**: `no_religion` has `0.000000` with `NaN` beta/t/p in both models → indicates the variable was **constant or got dropped** (coding error, merge error, or sample restriction that makes it invariant).
- **True**: “No religion” has nonzero betas: **0.057** (Model 1) and **0.024** (Model 2).

**Fix**
- Rebuild `no_religion` as a proper dummy in the estimation sample (0/1 with variation).
- Confirm it is not inadvertently set missing and then filled with 0, or perfectly collinear with other religion dummies (e.g., you included a full set of religion categories without a reference group).
- Check `var(no_religion)` **within the model sample** (after listwise deletion).

## 2) Sample size / listwise deletion mismatches (major)

### Model A
- **Generated N**: 327  
- **True N**: 644  
Your Model A is using about **half** the intended sample.

### Model B
- **Generated N**: 308  
- **True N**: 605  
Again about **half**.

**Likely causes**
- You may be requiring non-missing on variables that Bryson didn’t require (or that you accidentally created with lots of missingness), especially:
  - `racism_score` (your diagnostics show only **841 nonmissing** out of 1606)
  - `cons_protestant` (only **1023 nonmissing**—why is religion missing for ~600 cases?)
  - potential misconstructed DVs (genre dislike indices) producing lots of missing.

**Fix**
- Replicate the paper’s construction rules:
  - Use the same year (GSS 1993), same eligibility restrictions, and same index construction.
  - Apply **the same missing-data handling** (e.g., Bryson may have coded “don’t know” differently, or allowed partial indices).
- At minimum, diagnose where N collapses:
  - compute missingness **in the intersection** of DV + all IVs used in each model.
  - confirm you are not inadvertently dropping cases via filters (e.g., only those answering all genre items).

## 3) Variable name mismatches (explicit)

### A. Missing “Hispanic” in generated models
- **True table includes**: `Hispanic` (separate from Other race)
- **Generated models include**: `black`, `other_race`, but **no `hispanic`**

This is a direct specification mismatch.

**Fix**
- Add a `hispanic` dummy (coded exactly as in the paper/GSS coding used by Bryson).
- Ensure race/ethnicity categories match the paper (often: white=reference; black dummy; hispanic dummy; other-race dummy).

### B. Your DV names don’t align with the table’s DV definitions
- **Generated DV labels**:
  - `dislike_minority_genres` (ModelA label says `dislike_minority6`)
  - `dislike_other12_genres`
- **True DV definitions**:
  - Model 1: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”
  - Model 2: “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”

Potential mismatch: your indices may not use the exact genres (or the same coding, e.g., dislike vs like vs rating thresholds).

**Fix**
- Verify the exact six “minority-liked” genres and the exact remaining 12 genres match Bryson’s list and coding.
- Ensure the DV is **count of genres disliked** with the same response recode used in the article.

## 4) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas) and sign errors

Below I compare your `beta_std` to the paper’s standardized coefficients.

### Model 1 (true) vs your ModelA `beta_std`
| Variable | True beta | Generated beta_std | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.139 | close (ok-ish) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.261 | **too negative** |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | close |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | +0.030 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.026 | magnitude mismatch |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.191 | somewhat higher |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.127 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | (missing) | **omitted variable** |
| Other race | -0.017 | +0.004 | **sign mismatch** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.063 | 0.079 | close-ish |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN/0 | **wrong (dropped)** |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.022 | close |
| Constant (unstd) | 2.415*** | 2.654 | mismatch (but constants won’t match if DV/coding/sample differ) |

**Interpretation mismatch to flag**
- Your output suggests occupational prestige is (tiny) *positive* in Model A; the table shows it is *negative* (-0.020). That changes the qualitative conclusion (even if small).

### Model 2 (true) vs your ModelB `beta_std`
| Variable | True beta | Generated beta_std | Match? |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.005 | **sign mismatch & near zero** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.224 | close-ish |
| HH income pc | -0.065 | -0.095 | too negative |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.012 | **sign mismatch** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.091 | close-ish |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.091 | too small |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.112 | too large |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | (missing) | **omitted variable** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.132 | too large |
| Cons Protestant | 0.048 | 0.080 | too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN/0 | **wrong (dropped)** |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.142 | too large |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.674 | mismatch (again likely DV/coding/sample) |

Big substantive discrepancy: **racism_score** in Model 2 is positive (0.080) in the paper but you estimate ~0 (slightly negative). That’s not a rounding issue; it’s a different model/spec/sample/coding problem.

## 5) “Stars” / significance mismatches

Because your significance is computed from your own SEs and N (and the paper’s stars come from Bryson’s model on a different N/spec), the stars will not align.

Examples:
- **Model 1 Black**: True is ***; your ModelA shows only * (p≈.026).  
- **Model 2 Age**: True is **; your ModelB has p≈.11 (not significant).  
- **Model 2 Southern**: True is 0.069 (no star shown in the text you provided); your ModelB shows **.

**Fix**
- First fix the specification and sample so betas match; then compute p-values in a comparable way (OLS, same weighting decisions, same sample).  
- If you are trying to match the *published table exactly*, you generally should replicate *their* significance markers from the paper (not recompute from a different workflow).

---

## 6) R² and adjusted R² mismatches

- **Model 1 true**: R² = .145, Adj R² = .129  
  **Generated**: R² = .190, Adj R² = .164 (**too high**)

- **Model 2 true**: R² = .147, Adj R² = .130  
  **Generated**: R² = .166, Adj R² = .138 (somewhat high)

**Fix**
- This usually follows from the same core issues: wrong sample, wrong DV construction, omitted `hispanic`, dropped `no_religion`, possibly wrong coding of some IVs, and possibly adding constraints that reduce N and change covariances.

---

## 7) How to make the generated analysis match Table 2 (action checklist)

1) **Use the same estimation sample** as Bryson (GSS 1993; same inclusion rules).  
2) **Recreate the dependent variables exactly**:
   - Model 1: count of disliked among the specific 6 genres listed.
   - Model 2: count of disliked among the remaining 12.
   - Match Bryson’s recode for “dislike” and missing/DK responses.
3) **Match covariates and categories**:
   - Add `hispanic` dummy.
   - Ensure race dummies use the same reference category.
   - Ensure religion dummies do not create perfect collinearity and that `no_religion` varies in-sample.
4) **Replicate standardization**:
   - The table reports standardized coefficients. Either:
     - standardize all predictors (and possibly DV) consistent with beta computation, then run OLS, or
     - compute betas from unstandardized coefficients using SD ratios.  
   - Then report **only standardized coefficients** to match the table.
5) **Stop reporting SEs as if they come from Table 2**:
   - If you keep SEs, label them “computed from replication data, not reported in Bryson Table 2.”
6) **Verify outputs against targets**:
   - N should be ~644 and ~605.
   - R² should be ~.145 and ~.147.
   - Signs for key variables must match (notably: racism in Model 2 must be positive; occ prestige signs should align).

If you share (a) your code for constructing the two DV indices and (b) how you coded race/ethnicity and religion, I can pinpoint which step is causing the N collapse and the sign flips (especially for racism and occupational prestige).
