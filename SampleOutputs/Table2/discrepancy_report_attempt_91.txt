Score: 10/100
============================================================

## 1) Variable-name mismatches (and missing variables)

### A. “Hispanic” is wrongly treated as unavailable
- **Generated:** `Hispanic (not available)` with `NaN` in both models.
- **True:** **Hispanic is included in both models** with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **-0.058**
  - Model 2: **-0.029**

**Fix:** Ensure the extraction/parsing step includes the Hispanic row. If you’re mapping from code variables, map the dataset indicator (e.g., `hispanic`, `latino`, `hisp`) to the table label **“Hispanic”**. Do not drop it.

---

### B. “Other race” sign mismatch in Model 1
- **Generated:** `Other race` **+0.010337**
- **True:** `Other race` **-0.017**

**Fix:** Check the reference category coding and sign. This usually happens when:
1) the dummy is reversed (e.g., `white` coded instead of `other_race`), or  
2) the coefficient is read from the wrong column/model.

Make sure the dummy equals 1 for “Other race” and 0 otherwise, with “White” as the omitted category (as in the paper).

---

### C. Constant values don’t match the paper
- **Generated constants:** Model1 **2.783959***, Model2 **5.279039***  
- **True constants:** Model1 **2.415***, Model2 **7.860** (note: printed without stars)

**Fix:** You cannot reproduce Bryson’s intercepts unless you reproduce *exactly*:
- the same sample (N=644 / 605),
- the same variable scaling/standardization strategy,
- the same DV construction (counts of dislikes),
- and any weighting decisions.

Also: your output inconsistently labels the constant as “intercept (unstandardized)” while claiming the rest are “Std_Beta.”

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (all variables)

Below I list **Generated vs True** for each model.

### Model 1 coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.122475*** | 0.130** | wrong value + wrong sig level |
| Education | -0.229384*** | -0.175*** | wrong magnitude |
| Household income per capita | +0.031850 | -0.037 | **wrong sign** |
| Occupational prestige | +0.019453 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.051024 | -0.057 | wrong value (close) |
| Age | 0.083403* | 0.163*** | much too small + wrong sig |
| Black | -0.176121*** | -0.132*** | wrong magnitude |
| Hispanic | NaN | -0.058 | missing entirely |
| Other race | +0.010337 | -0.017 | wrong sign |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.084869* | 0.063 | wrong value + should be nonsig |
| No religion | 0.047827 | 0.057 | wrong value |
| Southern | 0.029447 | 0.024 | wrong value (close) |
| Constant | 2.783959*** | 2.415*** | wrong |

**Fix (Model 1):** You must re-estimate using the correct sample and correct standardization. The pervasive sign/magnitude differences (income, prestige, age) strongly suggest you are not using the same dataset construction and/or you are mixing standardized vs unstandardized coefficients.

---

### Model 2 coefficient mismatches
| Variable | Generated | True | Problem |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.025610 | 0.080 | wrong magnitude |
| Education | -0.187337*** | -0.242*** | wrong magnitude |
| Household income per capita | -0.003633 | -0.065 | wrong magnitude |
| Occupational prestige | -0.031843 | 0.005 | wrong sign (and magnitude) |
| Female | -0.064089 | -0.070 | wrong value (close) |
| Age | 0.045695 | 0.126** | much too small + missing sig |
| Black | 0.052598 | 0.042 | wrong value (close) |
| Hispanic | NaN | -0.029 | missing entirely |
| Other race | 0.058511 | 0.047 | wrong value (close) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.091344* | 0.048 | wrong magnitude + should be nonsig |
| No religion | 0.014859 | 0.024 | wrong value |
| Southern | 0.097494** | 0.069 | wrong magnitude + wrong sig |
| Constant | 5.279039*** | 7.860 | wrong |

**Fix (Model 2):** Same core issue: you are not reproducing Bryson’s model specification and/or the coefficient type.

---

## 3) Standard errors: required by your instruction, but impossible from the “true” table

- **Generated Results:** contain **no standard errors** either (only coefficients + stars).
- **True Results:** explicitly: **standard errors are not reported**.

So: there is **no SE mismatch to check** because SEs do not exist in the “true” reference. If you add SEs in the generated output, you *cannot* validate them against Table 2.

**Fix options:**
1) **Match the paper:** remove any SE/t-stat outputs and state: “Table reports standardized betas; SEs not shown.”  
2) **If you must show SEs:** you need the raw data (and any weights/design info) and rerun the regressions; then you’re no longer matching Table 2 “exactly as printed.”

---

## 4) Sample size and fit-statistic mismatches (major)

### N mismatches
- **Generated N:** Model1 **779**, Model2 **768**
- **True N:** Model1 **644**, Model2 **605**

**Fix:** You are not using the same analytic sample restrictions. Likely causes:
- different missing-data handling (you appear to use imputation flags like `education_imp`, `income_pc_imp`, etc.),
- different inclusion rules for “not asked” / “don’t know,”
- different dataset year or subset,
- different DV availability (DV counts depend on having responses to all genre items).

To match Bryson:
- replicate Bryson’s listwise deletion rules (or whatever he used) rather than keeping imputed cases,
- ensure the DV is computed only for respondents with the relevant genre items.

---

### R² / Adjusted R² mismatches
- **Generated:** Model1 R² **0.132**, Adj **0.116**; Model2 R² **0.103**, Adj **0.086**
- **True:** Model1 R² **0.145**, Adj **0.129**; Model2 R² **0.147**, Adj **0.130**

**Fix:** Once you match (a) the sample sizes and (b) the exact variable construction/standardization, R² should move toward the published values.

---

## 5) Interpretation / labeling mismatches

### A. You label coefficients as “Std_Beta” but also call the constant “unstandardized”
- In standardized-beta tables, the intercept is typically unstandardized, but then **you must ensure the betas are truly standardized** (yours clearly aren’t matching Bryson’s standardized betas).
- Your “Model1_Coefficient/Model2_Coefficient” columns are effectively being treated as standardized betas, but the magnitudes/signs don’t match.

**Fix:** Explicitly compute and report standardized coefficients the same way as Bryson. In most OLS software, “standardized coefficients” means:
\[
\beta_j^{std} = b_j \cdot \frac{s_{x_j}}{s_y}
\]
Confirm that’s what your pipeline is outputting.

### B. Significance stars don’t match
Examples:
- Model 1 Age: generated `*`, true `***`
- Model 1 Racism: generated `***`, true `**`
- Model 2 Southern: generated `**`, true none indicated

**Fix:** Stars must be based on the correct SEs/p-values from the correct sample/model. Since Table 2 doesn’t show SEs, you still can match stars **if** you reproduce the same regression and p-values. Right now, because your coefficients/sample differ, your stars will differ.

---

## 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1) **Recreate the exact DVs**
   - DV1: count of dislikes for {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}
   - DV2: count of dislikes for the other 12 genres  
   Ensure identical coding of “dislike” and handling of missing/not-asked responses.

2) **Use the correct predictors and category coding**
   - Race dummies: Black, Hispanic, Other race (White omitted)
   - Religion dummies: Conservative Protestant, No religion (reference category must match Bryson)
   - South indicator consistent with Bryson

3) **Match the sample construction**
   - Replicate Bryson’s inclusion rules to get **N=644** and **N=605**.
   - Do not use your current imputation approach if Bryson used listwise deletion (your `*_miss` flags strongly suggest you’re not matching).

4) **Estimate OLS and report standardized coefficients**
   - Output standardized betas (and do **not** invent SEs if your goal is “exactly as shown”).
   - Keep the intercept as printed (but it will only match if steps 1–3 match).

5) **Report fit stats exactly as in the paper**
   - R² and adjusted R² to 3 decimals as Bryson prints them.

If you want, paste your code (or describe how you created the DV counts, missing-data handling, and standardization). The biggest discrepancies (N, age effect size, income/prestige signs in Model 1) point to DV construction and/or standardization/sample-selection problems rather than minor transcription errors.
