============================================================

Below is a variable-by-variable audit of **every mismatch** between the *Generated Results* and the *True Results (Bryson 1996 Table 2)*, plus what you must change so the generated analysis matches the table.

---

## 1) Global / structural mismatches (these break equivalence even before comparing coefficients)

### 1.1 Wrong N (sample size) in both models
- **True (Table 2):**
  - Model 1: **N = 644**
  - Model 2: **N = 605**
- **Generated:**
  - Model 1: **N = 438**
  - Model 2: **N = 406**

**How to fix**
- You must reproduce Bryson’s **analytic sample definition** (same survey, same year, same exclusions, same missing-data handling).
- Your generated workflow is almost certainly doing **listwise deletion on a larger set of variables** than Table 2, or using different data/weights.
- Concretely: ensure you:
  1) start from the same dataset Bryson used,  
  2) construct the two DVs exactly as Bryson did,  
  3) restrict the sample exactly as Bryson did, and  
  4) apply the same missingness rule (often listwise deletion *within model*), not across both models or across extra variables.

### 1.2 Wrong R² and Adjusted R² in both models
- **True:**
  - Model 1: R² **0.145**, Adj R² **0.129**
  - Model 2: R² **0.147**, Adj R² **0.130**
- **Generated:**
  - Model 1: R² **0.1251**, Adj R² **0.1004**
  - Model 2: R² **0.1289**, Adj R² **0.1023**

**How to fix**
- Fixing the **sample (N)** and **DV construction** usually moves R² substantially.
- Also verify you are actually estimating **OLS on the same DV scale** (count outcome used as continuous in OLS, as in the paper). If you standardized the DV or changed it, R² will change.
- If weights were used in Bryson and you didn’t (or vice versa), R² and coefficients will differ.

---

### 1.3 “Standardized coefficients” label is inconsistent with the constant
- **True table:** says “standardized OLS coefficients” *but still prints a constant (unstandardized intercept)*.
- **Generated:** reports “Std_Beta” *and* prints a constant, marking it “intercept (unstandardized)”.

This part is **fine in principle**, but it creates a consistency requirement:
- If you truly report **standardized betas**, then:
  - the constant should be the intercept from the regression on the **raw DV**, with predictors standardized (or the post-hoc standardized beta computation), **not** the intercept from a fully standardized regression.

**How to fix**
- Compute betas the same way Bryson did (typical approach):
  - Run OLS on raw variables, then compute standardized betas:  
    \[
    \beta_j^{std} = b_j \cdot \frac{s_{x_j}}{s_y}
    \]
- Keep the intercept from the unstandardized model (as the table does).

---

### 1.4 Generated output does not (and cannot) compare standard errors—Table 2 has none
- **User asked:** “Identify every mismatch in … standard errors”
- **Reality:** The **True Results provide no SEs**, so you cannot match them.

**How to fix**
- Remove “standard errors” comparison entirely, or provide SEs only for the generated model while explicitly stating: *“Bryson (1996) Table 2 does not report SEs, so SE matching is not possible.”*

---

## 2) Variable name mismatches (labeling problems)

These are mostly cosmetic but must be corrected to match Table 2 exactly.

- Generated uses **“Age”** but analytic sample shows **age_years**. Table uses **Age**.  
  **Fix:** label as **Age** consistently.
- Generated uses **“Racism score”** but analytic sample shows **racism_score**. Table uses **Racism score**.  
  **Fix:** label as **Racism score** consistently.
- Generated uses **“Household income per capita”** but analytic sample shows **income_pc**.  
  **Fix:** label as **Household income per capita**.
- Generated uses **“Occupational prestige”** but analytic sample shows **occ_prestige**.  
  **Fix:** label as **Occupational prestige**.
- Generated uses **“Conservative Protestant”** but analytic sample shows **cons_prot**.  
  **Fix:** label as **Conservative Protestant**.
- Generated uses **“No religion”** but analytic sample shows **no_religion**.  
  **Fix:** label as **No religion**.
- Generated uses **“Southern”** but analytic sample shows **southern**.  
  **Fix:** label as **Southern**.

(Those fixes won’t change coefficients, but they address the “variable names” mismatch requirement.)

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 1)

**True Model 1 coefficients vs Generated Model 1 (“Std_Beta”)**

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.127** | small numeric difference |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.205*** | **wrong magnitude** |
| Household income per capita | -0.037 | +0.032 | **wrong sign** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | +0.007 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.075 | magnitude off |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.146** | **wrong magnitude + wrong sig** |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.155** | **wrong magnitude + wrong sig** |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | +0.030 | **wrong sign** |
| Other race | -0.017 | +0.000 | magnitude off (near zero) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.100 | magnitude off |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.066 | small difference |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.019 | **wrong sign** |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.575*** | wrong magnitude |

**How to fix Model 1**
1) **Rebuild DV1 exactly** as Bryson’s “minority-linked genres: 6” measure (same genre set, same coding of “dislike,” same missing rule per genre).
2) **Restore Bryson’s sample (N=644)** by aligning missing-data handling and any exclusions.
3) Ensure you are reporting **standardized betas** computed the same way as Bryson (see §1.3).
4) Check **coding direction** of key predictors that flip sign relative to the table:
   - **income_pc** likely needs transformation/coding/standardization consistent with the paper (e.g., logged income, top-coding, or a different income metric).
   - **Hispanic**, **Southern**, **Occupational prestige** sign flips often indicate:
     - wrong reference category (e.g., race dummies not defined the same),
     - miscoded 0/1 (e.g., Southern=1 means NOT South),
     - using different prestige scale (or reverse-coded).
5) Race dummies: Table 2 implicitly compares to **White** as reference. Confirm:
   - `black=1` Black else 0
   - `hispanic=1` Hispanic else 0
   - `other_race=1` other race else 0
   - and **white is omitted**.

## 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 2)

**True Model 2 coefficients vs Generated Model 2 (“Std_Beta”)**

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 (ns) | -0.034 (ns) | **wrong sign** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.223*** | magnitude off |
| Household income per capita | -0.065 | -0.030 | magnitude off |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.032 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.073 | close |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.114* | **wrong magnitude + wrong sig** |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.050 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.051 | magnitude off |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.078 | magnitude off |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.104 | magnitude off (about 2×) |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.015 | small difference |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.083 | small difference |
| Constant | 7.860 (no stars shown in table) | 5.534*** | **wrong magnitude + wrong interpretation of sig** |

**How to fix Model 2**
- Same main causes as Model 1: wrong sample (N should be 605), DV construction, and possibly predictor coding.
- The **racism score sign flip** is especially diagnostic:
  - Either the DV2 is not Bryson’s DV2, or the racism scale is reversed in your data (e.g., higher = less racist), or you standardized with reversed SD direction (rare but possible if coding is inverted before standardization).
- The **occupational prestige sign flip** similarly suggests prestige scale mismatch or coding errors.

## 5) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation/reporting errors)

### Model 1
- **Age**: True is **0.163***, Generated shows **0.146** (**)  
  → You understate significance.
- **Black**: True is **-0.132***, Generated shows **-0.155** (**)  
  → You understate significance.

### Model 2
- **Age**: True is **0.126** (**), Generated is **0.114** (*)  
  → You understate significance.
- **Constant**: True reports **7.860** with **no stars shown**; Generated shows **5.534***.  
  → You both changed the estimate and added significance not printed in the table.

**How to fix**
- Once the **sample** and **coefficients** match, significance will usually align.
- Also: apply Bryson’s exact star thresholds (*p<.05, **p<.01, ***p<.001 two-tailed*). Your stars may be computed correctly but differ because the model differs.
- For the constant: match the table’s reporting convention—Bryson does not show stars for the Model 2 constant, so you should not add them if you are trying to reproduce Table 2 formatting.

## 6) Interpretation mismatches

### 6.1 Racism score in Model 2
- **True:** racism score is **positive (0.080)**, interpreted as *more racism → more dislike of remaining genres* (though not significant).
- **Generated:** racism score is **negative (-0.034)**, which implies the opposite.

**Fix**
- Correct DV2 and/or racism coding direction. Confirm racism scale direction matches Bryson (higher = more racist).

### 6.2 Income and Southern in Model 1
- **True:** income is **negative**; Southern is **positive**.
- **Generated:** income is **positive**; Southern is **negative**.

**Fix**
- Recheck coding:
  - `southern`: 1 must mean South (not non-South).
  - `income_pc`: ensure the same measure, transformations, and missing rules.

---

## 7) What you should change in the generated tables to “match” Table 2

### Minimum required corrections (reporting)
1) Replace your Ns and fit statistics with the correct ones **only if** you truly reproduced the model; otherwise don’t overwrite—fix the model.
2) Remove any “standard errors” columns/claims of SE matching.
3) Ensure the coefficient column is explicitly **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas).

### Required corrections (analysis)
To actually match Table 2 numerically, you must:
- Use the **same dataset and sample** (target N=644 and N=605).
- Construct **DV1 and DV2** exactly as in Bryson (same “dislike” definition, same genre sets, same handling of missing per genre).
- Match predictor coding (especially: race dummies, southern, income, prestige, racism scale direction).
- Compute standardized betas the same way as Bryson (likely post-hoc standardization of OLS b’s).

## If you want, I can produce a “diff table” formatted exactly like Table 2
If you paste (or upload) the *actual regression output you ran* (unstandardized b, SE, p, and SDs of x and y), I can tell you precisely whether the remaining gaps are due to (a) standardization method, (b) coding direction, (c) sample restrictions, or (d) DV construction—and give you a concrete checklist to reconcile to N=644/605.
