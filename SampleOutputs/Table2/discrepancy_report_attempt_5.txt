### 1) Variable-name / variable-set mismatches

**A. Missing variables in the generated table**
- **Hispanic** is in the true Table 2 (both models) but **does not appear at all** in the generated results.
- **No religion** is in the true Table 2 (both models) but **does not appear at all** in the generated results.

**How to fix**
- Ensure the model specification includes both predictors, and that they survive any “kept_predictors” filtering:
  - Add `hispanic` (or the dataset’s equivalent) and `no_religion`/`norelig` explicitly to the formula.
  - If your pipeline drops predictors due to missingness, recode or impute, or use consistent missing-data handling (e.g., listwise deletion across *all* variables used in the paper so the same cases are used).
  - Verify coding: “Hispanic” must be its own dummy, not folded into `other_race`.

**B. Predictors included vs. true table**
- Generated predictors kept: `racism_score, educ, income_pc, prestg80, female, age, black, other_race, cons_prot, southern` (10 predictors).
- True table includes **11 predictors** (plus constant): adds **Hispanic** and **No religion**; also includes **Other race** separately (so Hispanic is not part of it).

**How to fix**
- Recreate race dummies exactly as in the paper:
  - White as the reference category.
  - Dummies: `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`.
- Recreate religion dummies exactly:
  - `cons_prot`, `no_religion` (and whatever the reference religion category is in the original study).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (by model)

Your generated table does not print variable names alongside each coefficient row, so we infer ordering from `model_1_predictors_kept`. Assuming the rows are in that same order, nearly every coefficient differs from the true Table 2.

#### Model 1 (true DV: dislike of minority-linked genres)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.146** | 0.130** | value differs |
| Education | -0.266*** | -0.175*** | **large** difference |
| Income pc | -0.048 | -0.037 | differs |
| Occupational prestige | 0.025 | -0.020 | **sign flip** |
| Female | -0.027 | -0.057 | differs |
| Age | 0.210*** | 0.163*** | differs |
| Black | -0.133* | -0.132*** | same magnitude, **stars wrong** |
| Other race | 0.010 | -0.017 | sign differs |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.071 | 0.063 | differs slightly |
| Southern | 0.017 | 0.024 | differs |

Also: **Hispanic** and **No religion** are missing entirely.

#### Model 2 (true DV: dislike of remaining 12 genres)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.008 | 0.080 | **large** difference |
| Education | -0.205** | -0.242*** | value + stars differ |
| Income pc | -0.098 | -0.065 | differs |
| Occupational prestige | -0.026 | 0.005 | sign differs |
| Female | -0.079 | -0.070 | differs slightly |
| Age | 0.132* | 0.126** | stars differ |
| Black | 0.092 | 0.042 | value differs |
| Other race | 0.116* | 0.047 | value + stars differ |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.097 | 0.048 | differs |
| Southern | 0.121* | 0.069 | differs |

Again: **Hispanic** and **No religion** missing.

**How to fix (coefficients)**
These are not “rounding” differences; they indicate you are not reproducing the same analysis. Common causes and fixes:
1. **Standardization mismatch**  
   The paper reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. Your output labels `beta_model_1` / `beta_model_2` suggest standardized betas, but your constants are unstandardized and your R²/N are far off (see below), which strongly suggests the whole workflow is not matching.
   - Fix: Standardize variables exactly as Bryson did (typically z-scoring continuous predictors; dummy variables usually left 0/1, then software can still compute standardized betas—different packages do this differently).
   - Best reproduction method: fit the OLS on original variables, then compute standardized betas using the same convention as the paper (e.g., using SDs from the estimation sample; confirm whether dummies were standardized or not).

2. **Different sample (case selection / missing data)**
   Your N is **340/326**, but the paper’s N is **644/605**. That alone will move coefficients a lot.
   - Fix: Use the same dataset/wave and the same inclusion criteria as Bryson (GSS year(s), age restrictions if any, etc.).
   - Apply **listwise deletion across the exact same set of variables** as the paper, or reproduce any imputation/weighting rules the paper used.
   - Your missingness report shows very high missingness (0.70 for one item), suggesting you may be including a variable with huge missingness or a merge problem.

3. **Different DV construction**
   The paper’s DVs are **indices**:
   - DV1: *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music* (6 genres)
   - DV2: *Dislike of the 12 remaining genres*
   Your descriptives show:
   - `dv1_dislike_minority_6` max = 6 (ok for sum of 6 binary dislikes or 0/1 indicators)
   - `dv2_dislike_remaining_12` max = 12 (also consistent)
   But the *means* and *constants* are inconsistent with Bryson’s constants (2.415, 7.860) and your model 2 constant is 5.205, not close to 7.860.
   - Fix: Verify the exact scoring:
     - Are you coding “dislike” the same way (e.g., “dislike” vs “like” vs “neutral”)?
     - Are you using the same genre set and the same mapping of survey responses into “dislike=1”?
     - Are you summing the same items (and only those items) and handling missing items the same way (paper may require nonmissing on all items or allow partial indices).

4. **Weights**
   Many GSS analyses use weights; unweighted vs weighted estimates can shift coefficients and N interpretation.
   - Fix: Check whether Bryson used weights; if yes, apply the same weight variable and variance estimation approach.

### 3) Standard errors: generated vs. true

- **True table reports no standard errors.**
- Your generated output also **does not show SEs**, only stars.

So there is **no direct “SE mismatch”** to compare, but there *is* a reporting mismatch:

**A. Significance stars are not comparable unless you reproduce the same testing**
- The true table’s stars come from the paper’s hypothesis tests (two-tailed). Your stars come from your regression output. Because your sample, DV construction, and model differ, the stars will differ.

**How to fix**
- After you reproduce the exact sample, DV, and predictors, compute p-values using the same assumptions (OLS; two-tailed t-tests; same df). Then your stars should align closely.

### 4) Fit statistics mismatches (N, R², adjusted R², constants)

**A. Sample size (N)**
- Generated: **340** (model 1), **326** (model 2)
- True: **644** (model 1), **605** (model 2)

**Fix**
- Your analytic sample is about half the intended size. This is the biggest red flag.
- Trace where cases are lost:
  - missing genre items used to build DVs
  - missing income/prestige
  - missing racism scale components
  - unintended filtering (e.g., complete cases on variables not in the paper)
  - wrong merge or wrong year(s)

**B. R² and Adjusted R²**
- Generated: R² **0.205 / 0.167**
- True: R² **0.145 / 0.147**

**Fix**
- Once sample and DV are corrected, R² should move toward the published values. If it remains off:
  - confirm standardization method doesn’t change R² (it shouldn’t for OLS with same variables, but DV construction and weighting will)
  - check inclusion of extra/omitted predictors (you omitted 2 predictors; oddly your R² is higher despite fewer predictors—again suggests different data/DV).

**C. Constant**
- Generated constants: **2.657** (model 1), **5.205** (model 2)
- True constants: **2.415*** (model 1), **7.860** (model 2)

**Fix**
- Constants depend heavily on DV scaling and coding.
- Recheck DV coding and whether the constant in the paper is unstandardized (it is) and estimated on the same DV scale.

---

### 5) Interpretation mismatches you should correct

Even if you didn’t write narrative interpretation here, the generated table implicitly invites interpretations that would be wrong relative to Bryson (1996) because:

- You would conclude **racism has ~0 effect in Model 2** (0.008), whereas the true table shows **positive 0.080**.
- You would conclude **occupational prestige increases DV1** (0.025) and decreases DV2 (-0.026), whereas the true table shows near-zero effects with different signs (-0.020, 0.005).
- You might understate the Black effect in Model 1 because you mark it only `*`, while the paper reports `***`.

**Fix**
- Don’t interpret until the replication matches: same variables, same sample, same DV construction, same weighting, and standardized coefficients as reported.

---

### 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the true Table 2

1. **Rebuild predictors to match exactly**
   - Add: `hispanic`, `no_religion`
   - Ensure race and religion reference categories match the paper.

2. **Recreate both DVs exactly**
   - Confirm the 6 “minority-liked” genres list matches Bryson’s.
   - Confirm the remaining 12 are exactly the complement.
   - Confirm “dislike” coding and how neutral/unknown responses are treated.
   - Decide and apply the same missing-item rule for index construction as the paper.

3. **Match the estimation sample**
   - Use the same survey year(s)/source.
   - Apply the same eligibility restrictions.
   - Apply listwise deletion on exactly the table’s variables (and not extra ones).
   - Diagnose why you drop to N=340/326; that is likely the primary failure.

4. **Use standardized coefficients in the same way**
   - Fit OLS, then compute standardized betas using the estimation-sample SDs.
   - Confirm whether dummy variables are standardized or not in your beta computation; use the convention consistent with the paper/software used.

5. **Only then compare stars**
   - Use two-tailed tests and the same p-value thresholds.
   - Expect minor differences from rounding, but not sign flips or huge coefficient changes.

If you share the code or at least the exact variable coding rules (especially the DV index construction and missing-data handling), I can pinpoint which step is driving the N collapse and the sign flips.
