Score: 13/100
============================================================

Below is a complete, item-by-item comparison of the **Generated Results** versus the **True Results (Bryson 1996, Table 2)**, covering **variable names, coefficients, (missing/incorrect) standard errors, model fit, N, constants, and interpretation/significance**—and exactly what to change to make the generated analysis match the table.

---

## 1) Core conceptual mismatch: your generated models are not Bryson’s Table 2 models

### Evidence of mismatch
- **True Table 2** sample sizes are **N=644 (Model 1)** and **N=605 (Model 2)**.
- **Generated** sample sizes are **N=261 (Model 1)** and **N=259 (Model 2)**.
- True R² values are **~.145/.147**; generated R² are **.178/.151** (and with drastically smaller N).
- True constants are **2.415 (Model 1)** and **7.860 (Model 2)**; generated constants are **2.593** and **5.185**.

### Fix
To match Table 2, you must replicate **Bryson’s analytic sample construction and variable coding**:
1. Use the same dataset/wave and inclusion rules as Bryson (GSS-based; Table 2 uses the full N in that analysis).
2. Recreate the two DVs exactly as Bryson did (same genre sets, same coding of “dislike” indices, same missing-data handling).
3. Apply the same listwise deletion (or imputation) approach used in the paper—your current pipeline is dropping far more cases.

Until N matches (or is very close), coefficient matching will not happen.

## 2) Variable name mismatches (labeling vs table naming)

These are mostly cosmetic, but some reflect deeper coding issues (see Section 4).

### Mismatches
- **“Racism score (0–5)”** (generated) vs **“Racism score”** (true).
- **“Education (years)”** vs **“Education”**.
- **“Age”** vs **“Age”** (ok, but you also show `age_years` in the sample—fine).
- Race categories: your table uses **Black / Hispanic / Other race** which matches conceptually.
- Religion: **“Conservative Protestant”** and **“No religion”** match conceptually.
- Region: **“Southern”** matches.

### Fix
Rename only for presentation to match Table 2 exactly (optional), e.g.:
- `"Racism score (0–5)" → "Racism score"`
- `"Education (years)" → "Education"`

But the real problem is not labels—it’s coefficients/coding and sample (next sections).

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (every variable)

### Model 1 DV: *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music*
(True β vs Generated β; significance in true table shown)

| Variable | True β | Generated β | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130\*\*** | 0.140\* | Significance level differs (** vs *). Coef close but not same. Likely due to N/coding. |
| Education | **-0.175\*\*\*** | -0.259\*\*\* | Too negative by a lot. |
| Income per capita | -0.037 | -0.012 | Magnitude too small (closer to 0). |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | +0.058 | **Wrong sign.** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.034 | Too small in magnitude. |
| Age | **0.163\*\*\*** | 0.175\*\* | Significance differs (*** vs **); coef slightly off. |
| Black | **-0.132\*\*\*** | -0.177\* | Too negative and much less significant in your output. |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.007 | Far too close to 0. |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.005 | Too close to 0. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.120 (no sig) | About double the size; significance missing. |
| **No religion** | 0.057 | **NaN (dropped)** | **Major mismatch: you dropped a term that exists in Table 2.** |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.059 | **Wrong sign** (positive in true table). |
| Constant | 2.415\*\*\* | 2.593\*\*\* | Different; again points to different DV scale/sample. |
| R² | 0.145 | 0.178 | Different. |
| Adj R² | 0.129 | 0.142 | Different. |
| N | 644 | 261 | **Not the same model/sample.** |

---

### Model 2 DV: *Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres*

| Variable | True β | Generated β | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.013 | **Wrong sign** (should be positive). |
| Education | **-0.242\*\*\*** | -0.165\* | Not negative enough and significance much weaker. |
| Income per capita | -0.065 | -0.077 | Close-ish but not exact. |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.079 | **Wrong sign** and magnitude far too large. |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.082 | Close-ish but not exact. |
| Age | **0.126\*\*** | 0.127\* | Significance differs (** vs *). |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.039 | Very close; ok. |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.023 | Close-ish. |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.122\* | Much too large and incorrectly significant. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.142\* | Much too large and incorrectly significant. |
| **No religion** | 0.024 | **NaN (dropped)** | **Major mismatch again.** |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.104 | Too large; sig differs (true shows none). |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.185\*\*\* | Constant is completely different (and true table doesn’t mark it with stars). |
| R² | 0.147 | 0.151 | Similar-ish but not same. |
| Adj R² | 0.130 | 0.114 | Different. |
| N | 605 | 259 | **Not the same model/sample.** |

## 4) “No religion” is incorrectly dropped in your generated results

### Evidence
Generated tables show:
- `No religion NaN dropped (no variation)`
- `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion`

But in your analytic samples, `no_religion` clearly has both 0 and 1 in the excerpt (e.g., many 0s; at least some 1s appear in the model2 sample excerpt). So “no variation” is likely a **bug in your variation check** or a **sample-filtering step** that created a temporary constant column.

### Fix
- Recompute the “no variation” check **after** subsetting to the final model frame and **after** converting types consistently.
- Ensure `no_religion` is numeric 0/1 (not all missing, not all strings).
- Verify you aren’t accidentally conditioning on religion in a way that makes `no_religion` constant (e.g., filtering to only religious respondents).
- In code terms: build the regression dataframe first, then check `nunique(dropna=True)`.

---

## 5) Standard errors: generated output doesn’t match the true table (because the true table has none)

### Mismatch
- User request: “Identify mismatch in … standard errors”
- **True Results**: explicitly: *Table 2 does not report standard errors.*
- **Generated Results**: also do not provide SEs—only standardized betas and significance stars. So there is **no SE mismatch**, but there is an **interpretation/reporting mismatch** if your narrative implies SEs exist or were compared.

### Fix options (choose one)
1. **Match Table 2 exactly:** do **not** report SEs; report only standardized betas + stars.
2. **If you must report SEs anyway:** compute them, but then you are no longer reproducing “exactly as shown” in Table 2. You’d need to clearly label them as “not in Bryson’s Table 2; computed from replication.”

---

## 6) Significance/star mismatches (interpretation errors)

Even when coefficients are close, the star levels differ frequently because:
- your N is much smaller,
- coefficients differ,
- possibly different standardization / weighting / clustering.

### Examples
- Model 1 Racism: true **0.130\*\*** vs generated 0.140\*
- Model 1 Age: true **0.163\*\*\*** vs generated 0.175\*\*
- Model 1 Black: true **-0.132\*\*\*** vs generated -0.177\*
- Model 2 Age: true **0.126\*\*** vs generated 0.127\*

### Fix
To reproduce stars:
- replicate **N**, **model specification**, and **standard errors** assumptions behind the p-values.
- confirm whether Bryson used **weighted GSS** analyses. If weights were used and you did not, stars (and even coefficients) can shift.
- ensure you’re using **two-tailed tests** and the same significance thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001).

---

## 7) Constant and DV scaling mismatches

### Evidence
- True Model 2 constant is **7.860** (no stars shown).
- Generated Model 2 constant is **5.185***.

That suggests your DV is scaled/constructed differently (e.g., different number of items, different coding range, different centering/standardization decisions).

### Fix
- Reconstruct DV indices to match Bryson:
  - same genre membership in each index,
  - same coding of “dislike” (e.g., whether “like” is reversed; how neutral is treated),
  - same aggregation method (sum vs mean; handling missing items).
- Confirm whether Bryson’s DV includes respondents with partial item response or requires complete response across the genre set.

---

## 8) Specific coefficient sign errors imply coding or variable-definition errors (not just sampling noise)

Sampling differences can shift magnitudes, but **repeated sign flips** are red flags for variable construction mismatches.

### Sign flips to fix
- **Model 1: Occupational prestige** true **-0.020**, generated **+0.058**
- **Model 1: Southern** true **+0.024**, generated **-0.059**
- **Model 2: Racism score** true **+0.080**, generated **-0.013**
- **Model 2: Occupational prestige** true **+0.005**, generated **-0.079**

### Likely causes
- Reverse coding (e.g., prestige scale reversed; racism reversed; South coded 1/0 swapped).
- Different operationalization (e.g., prestige is not the same prestige measure; South is census region vs “born in South”; racism index differs).

### Fix
- Verify coding direction against the paper/codebook:
  - Racism score should increase with racism (not tolerance).
  - Southern should be 1 if South, 0 otherwise.
  - Occupational prestige should align with higher prestige = higher value.
- Check whether you standardized after reversing or before.

---

## 9) Fit statistics mismatches

### Mismatches
- Model 1 true R² **0.145** vs generated **0.178**
- Model 2 true R² **0.147** vs generated **0.151**
- Adjusted R² also off.

### Fix
These will fall into place once you replicate:
- the sample (N),
- exact DV construction,
- exact predictors and coding,
- weighting.

## 10) What to change in the generated analysis (minimum checklist)

To make your generated analysis match Bryson Table 2:

1. **Rebuild analytic sample to match N=644 and N=605**  
   - Use same inclusion criteria and listwise deletion rules.
2. **Recreate DV1 and DV2 exactly**  
   - Same genres per index; same dislike coding; same aggregation and missing handling.
3. **Fix “no_religion dropped” bug**  
   - Ensure it’s not incorrectly flagged as no-variation.
4. **Verify coding direction** for racism, prestige, and southern (sign flips suggest errors).
5. **Use standardized OLS coefficients** (as you do)  
   - But make sure standardization matches Bryson’s approach (standardize variables in the analytic sample, not the full dataset with different missingness).
6. **Apply weights (if Bryson did)**  
   - If Table 2 used GSS weights, unweighted replication won’t match.
7. **Report exactly what Table 2 reports**  
   - standardized betas + stars, no SEs.

If you paste (a) your DV construction code/formula and (b) your sample filtering/listwise deletion steps, I can pinpoint exactly which step is causing the N collapse and the sign flips.
