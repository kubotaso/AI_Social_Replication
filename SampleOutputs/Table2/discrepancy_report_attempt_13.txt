Score: 55/100
============================================================

## 1) Variable-name / inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is incorrectly dropped**
- **Generated:** “Hispanic (not in extract; constant 0 => dropped for no variation)” and shows `NaN` betas; fit table says dropped predictor `hispanic`.
- **True:** Hispanic is included in both models with nonzero coefficients (Model 1: **-0.058**; Model 2: **-0.029**).

**How to fix**
- Your data extract/merge/coding is wrong for Hispanic. Common failure modes:
  1) You did not load the HISPANIC variable, or loaded the wrong wave/file.
  2) You recoded missing to 0 (making everyone “not Hispanic”), collapsing all variation.
  3) You created `hispanic` from the wrong source variable (e.g., using a “Spanish language interview” flag, or a race-only variable).
- Fix by deriving Hispanic as in the GSS for that year (often via `HISPANIC` or `ETHNIC`, depending on release), **without** recoding missing to 0. Keep missing as missing, and let listwise deletion handle it (as in the paper).

---

### B. **Conservative Protestant is mis-defined (proxy)**
- **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy: Protestant & Baptist; missing treated as 0)”
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant” in Bryson is not simply “Protestant & Baptist.” It’s typically based on denominational/fundamentalist classification (often derived from denominational codes), not a crude Baptist+Protestant proxy.

**Impact:** Misclassification changes coefficients and significance (you have 0.070 / 0.092* vs true 0.063 / 0.048).

**How to fix**
- Recreate Bryson’s conservative Protestant measure using the same denomination/fundamentalist scheme used in the paper (often a Steensland-style or similar classification; Bryson 1996 predates Steensland but uses a denomination-based conservative grouping).
- Do **not** set missing religion/denom to 0; treat as missing or include “missing” category.

---

### C. **“No religion” coding may not match**
- **Generated:** `RELIG==4; missing treated as 0`
- **True:** “No religion” (coefs 0.057 and 0.024)

**How to fix**
- Confirm RELIG coding matches the paper’s year (GSS categories can vary slightly across years/releases).
- Don’t code missing as 0 (which asserts missing respondents are religious). Keep missing and drop listwise.

---

### D. **DV construction: likely mismatch in genre lists and/or missing-data rule**
Your DV means (2.06 of 6; 3.78 of 12) aren’t enough to prove mismatch, but your **N** and **R²** differences suggest the analytic sample/DV construction does not match the paper.

**How to fix**
- Recreate both DVs exactly:
  - DV1: dislikes of **Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin**
  - DV2: dislikes of the **other 12** listed in the paper’s module
- Ensure “dislike” is coded exactly as Bryson did (e.g., collapsing response categories into a dislike indicator). Any different threshold (e.g., only “strongly dislike” vs “dislike or strongly dislike”) will shift coefficients and N.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (generated vs true)

Below I list every mismatch in standardized betas and/or stars.

### Model 1 (Minority-linked 6)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.132*** | 0.130** | **Star level differs** (*** vs **); coef slightly off |
| Education | -0.190*** | -0.175*** | Coef too negative |
| Income pc | -0.030 | -0.037 | Slightly off |
| Prestige | -0.002 | -0.020 | **Big mismatch** (near 0 vs negative) |
| Female | -0.060 | -0.057 | Close (ok) |
| Age | 0.170*** | 0.163*** | Close (ok) |
| Black | -0.135** | -0.132*** | **Star level differs** (** vs ***) |
| Hispanic | dropped/NaN | -0.058 | **Omitted variable** |
| Other race | -0.013 | -0.017 | Close (ok) |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.070 | 0.063 | Close-ish |
| No religion | 0.052 | 0.057 | Close-ish |
| Southern | 0.021 | 0.024 | Close-ish |
| Constant | 2.411*** | 2.415*** | Close (ok) |
| R² | 0.141 | 0.145 | Slightly low |
| Adj R² | 0.126 | 0.129 | Slightly low |
| N | 645 | 644 | Off by 1 |

**Key problems driving Model 1 differences**
- Hispanic incorrectly removed (affects other coefficients too).
- Prestige coefficient is way off (likely a different prestige variable, scaling, or sample restriction).
- Significance stars are not matching even where coefficients are close—this usually indicates different **standardization, sample, weights, or model SE assumptions** (but note: the paper’s stars come from its own t-tests; you’re reproducing them from your fitted model).

### Model 2 (Remaining 12)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.024 (ns) | 0.080 (ns) | **Coefficient much smaller** |
| Education | -0.234*** | -0.242*** | Close |
| Income pc | -0.061 | -0.065 | Close |
| Prestige | 0.022 | 0.005 | Off (sign ok but too big) |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.070 | Somewhat off |
| Age | 0.098* | 0.126** | **Coef too small; stars differ** |
| Black | 0.085* | 0.042 (ns) | **Too large; wrong significance** |
| Hispanic | dropped/NaN | -0.029 | **Omitted variable** |
| Other race | 0.053 | 0.047 | Close |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.092* | 0.048 | **Too large; wrong sig** |
| No religion | 0.012 | 0.024 | Smaller |
| Southern | 0.068 | 0.069 | Match |
| Constant | 5.235*** | 7.860 | **Major mismatch** (both value and stars) |
| R² | 0.132 | 0.147 | Too low |
| Adj R² | 0.116 | 0.130 | Too low |
| N | 600 | 605 | Off by 5 |

**Key problems driving Model 2 differences**
- DV construction and/or sample selection clearly diverges (big constant difference; N off by 5; R² off).
- Hispanic omitted again.
- Conservative Protestant measure likely wrong.
- Black effect and age effect differ meaningfully—often a sign that the DV coding differs, weights differ, or the sample differs.

## 3) “Standard errors” mismatch
- **Generated:** You do not show SEs in the excerpt, but your instruction asks to compare SEs.
- **True:** The paper **does not report standard errors** in Table 2.

**How to fix**
- If your generated table includes SEs elsewhere, you **cannot** directly “match” Table 2 on SEs because there are none to match to.
- To match the paper: suppress SE columns and report standardized coefficients + stars only.
- If you want to reproduce stars, you must also replicate **their** testing approach (including any weighting, design effects, and the exact sample).

---

## 4) Interpretation / reporting mismatches

### A. Misreporting “Hispanic not in extract”
- **Generated interpretation:** suggests Hispanic is not present and thus legitimately dropped.
- **True:** Hispanic is substantively part of the model and reported.

**Fix:** Don’t rationalize the omission—treat it as a replication failure and correct the data pipeline.

### B. Constant and standardization inconsistency
- You’re labeling coefficients as “Std_Beta” while also reporting an unstandardized-looking constant.
- In standardized-regression presentations, constants depend on whether DV was standardized and whether predictors were standardized. Bryson reports standardized coefficients but still reports a constant in the table. Your Model 2 constant is nowhere near the true one (5.23 vs 7.86), implying **DV scale or coding differs**, not just standardization.

**Fix**
- Ensure the DV is constructed on the same 0–6 and 0–12 counts using the same “dislike” threshold.
- Ensure standardization procedure matches: typically betas are from a regression on original scales converted to standardized coefficients (or equivalently regression on standardized variables). But the constant must be computed on the original DV scale if you want to match Bryson’s constant.

## 5) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match

1) **Rebuild Hispanic correctly**
   - Use the correct GSS Hispanic/ethnicity variable for that year.
   - Don’t set missing to 0.
   - Confirm it has variation (tabulate it before modeling).

2) **Rebuild Conservative Protestant correctly**
   - Use denomination-based conservative Protestant classification consistent with Bryson.
   - Don’t use “Protestant & Baptist” as a proxy.

3) **Recreate both DVs exactly**
   - Verify the exact 6 “minority-linked” items and the remaining 12 match the paper.
   - Match the binary “dislike” coding rule.
   - Apply the same missing-item rule (e.g., whether you require all items vs allow partial and rescale). Your racism scale uses a “>=4/5 answered, rescaled” rule—do the analogous thing for the music indices if the paper does.

4) **Match sample restrictions**
   - Ensure you are using the same survey year(s), same module, same age restrictions (if any), and same treatment of “don’t know / not applicable / refused”.

5) **Match weighting / design**
   - If Bryson used weights (common in GSS analyses), apply them.
   - If clustering/stratification adjustments were used for significance, replicate that; otherwise your stars can differ even with identical betas.

6) **Use the same variables/scales**
   - Prestige: ensure you’re using the same prestige measure Bryson used (PRESTG80 may be right, but verify).
   - Income per capita: confirm REALINC/HOMPOP matches the paper’s construction (and whether income is logged, trimmed, etc.).

If you paste the code (or at least: how you coded Hispanic, conservative Protestant, each DV, and what years/weights you used), I can pinpoint which of the above is actually responsible for each coefficient difference—especially the large ones (Model 2 constant, racism in Model 2, prestige in Model 1, Black in Model 2).
