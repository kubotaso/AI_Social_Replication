## 1) Structural/reporting mismatches (what the “true” table contains vs what was generated)

### A. Wrong estimand: generated tables mix unstandardized and standardized results
- **True Table 2 reports standardized coefficients only** (plus significance stars). It does **not** report unstandardized coefficients, *t*, *p*, or standard errors.
- **Generated Results report**: `b_unstd`, `beta_std`, `std_err`, `t`, `p_value`.

**How to fix**
- If your goal is to match Bryson (1996) Table 2, you must output **only standardized coefficients** and (optionally) significance markers—**no SE/t/p**, unless you compute them from the microdata yourself (but then it still won’t match the PDF table because the PDF omits them).
- Drop the `b_unstd`, `std_err`, `t`, `p_value` columns from the “matching” output. Keep only `beta_std` and add stars based on p-values *you compute*, clearly labeled as “computed from GSS microdata,” not “from Table 2.”

### B. Wrong sample sizes and fit statistics
- **True Model 1**: **N = 644**, **R² = .145**, **Adj R² = .129**
- **Generated ModelA_fit**: **N = 294**, **R² = 0.170**, **Adj R² = 0.141**
- **True Model 2**: **N = 605**, **R² = .147**, **Adj R² = .130**
- **Generated ModelB_fit**: **N = 281**, **R² = 0.148**, **Adj R² = 0.116**

**How to fix**
- You are not using the same analytic sample. To match:
  - Use **GSS 1993** only.
  - Construct the exact two DVs as Bryson did (see below) and apply the same missing-data handling (likely listwise deletion across all model variables).
  - Ensure the same covariates and coding.
- After reproducing the sample and variables, your N should come out close to **644/605** (exactly those if you replicate perfectly).

### C. Wrong number of predictors shown (missing “Southern” and unclear intercept handling)
- **True table includes 12 predictors + Constant** (13 rows total): Racism, Education, Income pc, Occ prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, Southern, Constant.
- **Generated tables have 11 coefficient rows** (looks like Constant + 10 predictors), meaning **at least one predictor is missing**. The obvious missing one is **Southern**.

**How to fix**
- Add the **Southern** indicator to both models exactly as in the paper.
- Verify you are not accidentally dropping a category (e.g., if race dummies are coded differently) or excluding a religion dummy.
- Output rows with explicit variable names so this is auditable.

### D. Variable names are missing entirely in the generated tables
- Generated tables show numeric rows with no variable labels, so you cannot verify correspondence to the true covariates.

**How to fix**
- Print a labeled coefficient table with the exact variable names from Table 2 (Racism score, Education, etc.).
- Ensure ordering matches the published table.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (direction/magnitude) by model

Because the generated tables are unlabeled, the only coefficient we can confidently match is the **Constant** (it’s the only unstandardized coefficient in the published table). For the rest, we can compare **your `beta_std` column** against the **true standardized coefficients**, but only if we assume your row order corresponds to the paper’s order. Under that assumption, there are major mismatches.

### Model 1 (Dislike of minority-linked genres): mismatches
**True (standardized):**
- Racism **0.130**
- Education **-0.175**
- Income pc **-0.037**
- Occ prestige **-0.020**
- Female **-0.057**
- Age **0.163**
- Black **-0.132**
- Hispanic **-0.058**
- Other race **-0.017**
- Cons Prot **0.063**
- No religion **0.057**
- Southern **0.024**
- Constant **2.415** (unstandardized)

**Generated ModelA (assuming same order):**
- Constant (b_unstd) = **2.919** (should be **2.415**) → mismatch
- Racism beta_std = **0.123** (close to **0.130**) → minor mismatch
- Education beta_std = **-0.257** (should be **-0.175**) → mismatch (too negative)
- Income beta_std = **-0.004** (should be **-0.037**) → mismatch (near zero)
- Occ prestige beta_std = **0.019** (should be **-0.020**) → **sign mismatch**
- Female beta_std = **-0.034** (should be **-0.057**) → mismatch
- Age beta_std = **0.161** (close to **0.163**) → close
- Black beta_std = **-0.150** (vs **-0.132**) → moderate mismatch
- Hispanic beta_std = **-0.006** (vs **-0.058**) → mismatch (far too small)
- Other race beta_std = **0.108** (vs **-0.017**) → **sign mismatch and large**
- Cons Prot beta_std = **0.010** (vs **0.063**) → mismatch
- No religion beta_std = ??? (your table ends here; also Southern is missing) → mismatch/omission

**How to fix**
- The pattern (several coefficients near 0, sign flips, and wrong constant) strongly suggests **your DV and/or covariates are not coded/constructed the same** and/or you are on a **different sample/year**.
- Rebuild:
  1. **DV construction**: confirm the exact set of genres in Model 1 (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin) and how “disliked” is counted (binary dislike per genre summed). Any difference (e.g., including “neutral,” treating missing as 0, different coding of “dislike”) will change coefficients.
  2. **Race dummies**: ensure White is the reference and you include **Black, Hispanic, Other race** as separate indicators consistent with Bryson.
  3. **Religion dummies**: “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” must be coded the same, with the same omitted category.
  4. Include **Southern**.
  5. Restrict to **GSS 1993** and apply **listwise deletion** across the full model set.
  6. Compute standardized coefficients as in OLS: standardize Xs and Y (or use the equivalence from unstandardized b’s and SDs), and report those.

### Model 2 (Dislike of remaining 12 genres): mismatches
**True (standardized):**
- Racism **0.080**
- Education **-0.242**
- Income pc **-0.065**
- Occ prestige **0.005**
- Female **-0.070**
- Age **0.126**
- Black **0.042**
- Hispanic **-0.029**
- Other race **0.047**
- Cons Prot **0.048**
- No religion **0.024**
- Southern **0.069**
- Constant **7.860**

**Generated ModelB (assuming same order):**
- Constant (b_unstd) = **5.345** (should be **7.860**) → large mismatch
- Racism beta_std = **-0.016** (should be **+0.080**) → **sign mismatch**
- Education beta_std = **-0.171** (should be **-0.242**) → mismatch
- Income beta_std = **-0.088** (should be **-0.065**) → mismatch
- Occ prestige beta_std = **-0.046** (should be **+0.005**) → **sign mismatch**
- Female beta_std = **-0.079** (should be **-0.070**) → close-ish
- Age beta_std = **0.094** (should be **0.126**) → mismatch
- Black beta_std = **0.130** (should be **0.042**) → too large
- Hispanic beta_std = **0.135** (should be **-0.029**) → **sign mismatch**
- Other race beta_std = **0.088** (should be **0.047**) → mismatch
- Cons Prot beta_std = **0.127** (should be **0.048**) → too large
- No religion beta_std = missing? (and Southern missing) → omission

**How to fix**
- Same fixes as Model 1, plus:
  - Verify the **Model 2 DV** is *exactly* “the 12 remaining genres” (i.e., total disliked across the other 12, not the full 18, not a different subset).
  - The **constant** being dramatically off (5.345 vs 7.860) is consistent with a different DV range/definition or different number of genres included in the count.

## 3) Standard errors and interpretation mismatches

### A. Standard errors: cannot be “true” relative to Table 2
- Your generated SEs cannot be checked against the PDF because **the PDF provides none**.
- Presenting SEs as if they come from Table 2 is therefore a **reporting discrepancy**.

**How to fix**
- Either:
  1. Remove SEs entirely when claiming to reproduce Table 2; or
  2. Keep SEs but explicitly label them as **computed from your replication dataset**, and then your coefficients, N, and R² must also match (or be justified if they differ).

### B. Interpretation mismatch risk: wrong sign implies wrong substantive conclusion
Examples if your mapping/order is correct:
- Model 2 racism: **true is +0.080 (positive)**; generated is **negative**. That flips the conclusion about whether racism predicts disliking the “other 12” genres.
- Model 2 Hispanic: **true negative (-0.029)**; generated positive.

**How to fix**
- Do not write interpretations until:
  - variables are labeled,
  - coefficients match the published direction/magnitude,
  - the DV and sample are verified.

## 4) Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match the published Table 2

1. **Use GSS 1993 only**.
2. **Recreate both DVs exactly**:
   - Model 1: count of disliked among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}.
   - Model 2: count of disliked among the other 12 genres (confirm the exact list from the instrument).
   - Use the same rule for “dislike” and missing (don’t recode missing as 0).
3. **Include all predictors** from Table 2:
   - Racism score, Education, HH income per capita, Occ prestige, Female, Age, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Conservative Protestant, No religion, **Southern**.
4. **Match coding and reference categories** (especially race and religion).
5. **Listwise delete** cases with missing on any included variable so N aligns (644/605).
6. **Report standardized coefficients only** (and stars), and match R²/Adj R².

If you provide your variable coding (especially the genre “dislike” items, racism scale construction, and the exact model formula/output with labels), I can pinpoint exactly which row corresponds to which covariate and identify *additional* mismatches beyond the “missing Southern / wrong N / wrong DV” problems.
