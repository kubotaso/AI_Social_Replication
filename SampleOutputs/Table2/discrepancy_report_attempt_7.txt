### 1) Variables included / variable-name mismatches

**Mismatch A — “No religion” is missing from the generated models**
- **True Table 2:** includes **No religion** (Model 1 = 0.057; Model 2 = 0.024).
- **Generated Results:** predictor lists for both models do **not** include `no_religion` (or any equivalent).
- **How to fix:** add the paper’s “No religion” indicator to both model specifications and rerun.
  - Ensure it is coded the same way as the paper (typically a dummy for “no religion,” with some reference category such as Protestant/Catholic/other).  
  - If your dataset uses different categories, you must reproduce Bryson’s coding (i.e., same reference group).

**Mismatch B — Southern is included, but its coefficient direction/significance is wrong**
- Variable exists (`southern`) in generated predictors, so the mismatch is not name but **estimate** (see section 2).

**Mismatch C — DV definitions and scaling do not match the paper**
- **True DVs:**  
  - Model 1 DV: *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music* (a composite of 6 items)  
  - Model 2 DV: *Dislike of the 12 remaining genres* (composite of 12 items)
- **Generated dv_descriptives:** shows ranges **0–6** and **0–12** with means ~2.06 and ~3.78, suggesting *counts/sums* of “dislikes.”
- That *might* be consistent with a summed index, but the paper reports **standardized OLS coefficients**, which implies the DV is treated continuously and then coefficients are standardized (or variables standardized before regression).
- **How to fix:** confirm the DV construction matches Bryson exactly (which genres are in each index; how “dislike” is coded; how missing items are handled). Then standardize as in the paper (details below).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (by variable)

Below I map the generated rows to the intended variables using the **predictor order** shown in `model_1_predictors_used` and `model_2_predictors_used`:

Order used:  
1 `racism_score`  
2 `educ`  
3 `income_pc`  
4 `prestg80`  
5 `female`  
6 `age`  
7 `black`  
8 `hispanic`  
9 `other_race`  
10 `cons_prot`  
11 `southern`  
(**No religion missing**)

#### Model 1 (True vs Generated)
| Variable | True coef | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.140* | close magnitude, **wrong stars** (should be ** not *) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.260*** | substantially more negative |
| Income pc | -0.037 | -0.012 | too small (closer to 0) |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.058 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.034 | smaller magnitude |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.175** | close magnitude, **wrong stars** (*** vs **) |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.177* | too negative and **stars way off** (*** vs *) |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.007 | much closer to 0 |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.005 | closer to 0 |
| Cons Protestant | 0.063 | 0.120 | about double |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.059 | **wrong sign** |
| No religion | 0.057 | (omitted) | **omitted variable** |

#### Model 2 (True vs Generated)
| Variable | True coef | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.013 | **wrong sign** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.165* | too small magnitude and **stars off** |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.077 | close |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.079 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.082 | close |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.127* | close magnitude, **stars off** (** vs *) |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.039 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.023 | close |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.122* | far too large, and unexpectedly significant |
| Cons Protestant | 0.048 | 0.142* | far too large |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.104 | somewhat larger |
| No religion | 0.024 | (omitted) | **omitted variable** |

**Primary reasons these coefficient mismatches happen (and fixes):**
1. **You are not reproducing the same sample** (see N mismatch below). Different N ⇒ different estimates.
   - Fix: replicate Bryson’s inclusion/exclusion rules and the survey/year used; align missing-data handling.
2. **You are not using standardized coefficients the way the paper does.**
   - Fix: produce standardized betas (either z-score all variables then run OLS, or use software option that reports standardized coefficients).
3. **Coding differences in key predictors** (e.g., racism scale construction, education coding, income per capita definition, race dummies, religion categories).
   - Fix: reconstruct each variable exactly as in the paper and use the same reference categories.
4. **Wrong DV construction** (wrong genre grouping, wrong “dislike” definition, different aggregation with missing items).
   - Fix: rebuild the indices to match the item sets in the footnote and paper; match missing-item rule (e.g., require non-missing on all items vs allow partial and average).
5. **Survey weights / design effects ignored.**
   - The paper may or may not weight; if it does and you didn’t, coefficients can shift.
   - Fix: check paper’s methods; apply weights if used.

### 3) Standard errors reported (but they shouldn’t be) + star logic mismatch

**Mismatch — True table reports no SEs; generated output implies significance stars computed from SEs**
- **True:** “does not report standard errors (nor t-statistics).”
- **Generated:** gives stars, which implies you calculated p-values from SEs/t-stats (even though SEs aren’t shown in the excerpt).
- **How to fix (two options):**
  1. **To match the published table:** do **not display SEs**; show only standardized betas and the significance stars as in the paper (but then you must compute stars using the correct SEs/p-values under the correct model/specification/sample).
  2. **If you want an analysis table with SEs:** that’s fine analytically, but it will **not match Table 2**. You’d need to label it explicitly as “replication with SEs” and accept it won’t be identical.

**Star mismatches are widespread**
- Example: Model 1 Black is *** in the true table but only * in generated.
- That typically indicates **different N**, **different residual variance**, **different model**, or **different standardization/weighting**.

### 4) Fit statistics mismatches (N, R², constants)

**Mismatch A — N is completely different**
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605  
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=261; Model 2 N=259
- **How to fix:** you are losing >50% of the sample. Likely causes:
  - listwise deletion due to missingness (and you have *massive* missingness reported),
  - variables constructed from many items with missing values,
  - merging data incorrectly,
  - restricting to a subset (e.g., only a race group, only certain years).
- Concrete fixes:
  - Recreate variables with the same missing-data rule Bryson used (e.g., scale scores from available items rather than requiring complete data, if appropriate).
  - Don’t include variables/items that are not in Bryson’s model.
  - Verify you are using the same dataset/wave and respondent universe as Bryson.

**Mismatch B — R² and adjusted R² do not match**
- **True:** R² ≈ 0.145/0.147; Adj R² ≈ 0.129/0.130  
- **Generated:** R² ≈ 0.178 and 0.151; Adj R² ≈ 0.142 and 0.114
- **How to fix:** once you fix the sample, DV construction, predictor coding, standardization, and weights, these should move toward the published values.

**Mismatch C — Constants**
- **True constants:** 2.415*** (M1), 7.860 (M2; notably no stars shown in your transcription)  
- **Generated constants:** 2.593*** (M1), 5.185*** (M2)
- Constants differ because:
  - the DV scale/centering differs,
  - standardization differs (if fully standardized regression is used, intercept should be ~0),
  - sample differs.
- **How to fix:** match DV construction/scale and standardization approach.  
  - Important: In many “standardized coefficient” tables, **only slopes are standardized** and the intercept remains on the original DV scale—so you should not z-score the DV if you want intercepts comparable to the paper. Decide which standardization procedure reproduces Bryson (commonly: standardize X’s and Y to get standardized slopes; but intercept then becomes 0 if both standardized—so Bryson likely did *not* standardize Y in the estimation output, or he reported standardized slopes computed post hoc while keeping the raw intercept).

### 5) Interpretation mismatches (what the generated results imply vs what the true results imply)

Key substantive direction differences that would flip interpretations:

- **Racism score (Model 2):**  
  - **True:** +0.080 (positive association)  
  - **Generated:** -0.013 (slightly negative)  
  - Fix requires: correct DV2 construction, correct racism scale coding, correct sample/weights, and include “No religion.”

- **Occupational prestige (both models):**  
  - **True:** near zero (M1 -0.020; M2 0.005)  
  - **Generated:** sizable and negative in M2 (-0.079) and positive in M1 (0.058)  
  - Likely coding mismatch (prestige measure, scaling), or sample differences.

- **Southern (Model 1):**  
  - **True:** +0.024 (small positive)  
  - **Generated:** -0.059 (negative)  
  - Often indicates different regional coding or different reference category.

### 6) Missingness outputs indicate a replication-breaking problem

Your missingness tables show extremely high missing shares (e.g., ~0.48, ~0.36, ~0.29…). Also `item_missingness` shows `NaN` for whole blocks and racism items missing ~0.36–0.38.

This aligns with the tiny N and will almost certainly prevent matching Bryson.

**How to fix missingness so you can match Table 2:**
1. **Stop computing DV indices in a way that creates missing for anyone missing any item** (unless that is what Bryson did). Use the same rule as the paper (often: mean of non-missing items if at least k items answered).
2. **Confirm you are pulling the correct questionnaire items.** `NaN` suggests joins/selection problems (items not present, misnamed columns, or filtered out).
3. **Recreate racism score exactly** (items, reverse coding, scaling). A racism index with ~38% missing seems unusually high unless many items are optional or from a different module.
4. **Use consistent listwise deletion only after** constructing scales properly—then check N against ~644 and ~605.

### 7) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match the true Table 2

1. **Add “No religion”** dummy to both models with the correct reference group.
2. **Rebuild both DVs** using the exact genre lists and dislike coding; document the item-to-index mapping.
3. **Match standardization procedure** used for “standardized OLS coefficients.”
   - Replication approach: run the same OLS on raw variables, then compute standardized betas post-estimation:
     \[
     \beta^{std}_j = b_j \cdot \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
     \]
   - This keeps the intercept on the DV scale (consistent with Bryson having nonzero constants).
4. **Match sample definition** to recover N≈644 and N≈605.
   - Same survey/year, same population restrictions, same missing-data rules.
5. **Match coding of predictors**:
   - `educ` scale, `income_pc` definition, `prestg80` measure, race dummies, `cons_prot`, `southern`.
6. **Check weights**: if the paper used weights, apply them; if not, don’t.
7. **Only then** compute stars using the same two-tailed thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001). If you can’t match stars, you still have a sample/model mismatch.

If you share (a) your exact variable coding definitions and (b) the model formulas you ran (and whether you weighted/standardized), I can pinpoint which specific construction choices are producing the sign flips (especially racism in Model 2 and prestige/southern in Model 1).
