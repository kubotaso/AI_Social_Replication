Score: 22/100
============================================================

Below is a line‑by‑line audit of what you generated versus what Bryson (1996) Table 2 actually reports, plus concrete fixes to make the generated output match the published table.

---

## 1) **Model naming / numbering mismatch**
### Mismatch
- **Generated:** “Table 2 Model A” and “Model B”
- **True:** “Model 1” and “Model 2”

### Fix
- Rename outputs to **Model 1** (minority-linked 6 genres) and **Model 2** (remaining 12 genres).  
  This is cosmetic but required for a faithful reproduction.

---

## 2) **Dependent variable (DV) labeling mismatch**
### Mismatch
- **Generated DV text** is close, but includes extra parenthetical “(count of 6)” and “(count of 12)” wording and slightly different phrasing.
- **True DV names** are exactly:
  - Model 1 DV: *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music*
  - Model 2 DV: *Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres*

### Fix
- Use the exact paper DV titles in tables and captions.
- If you want to keep “count of 6/12,” put it in a footnote, not in the DV title.

---

## 3) **Variable name mismatches (table labels)**
### Mismatch
Generated labels differ from the paper’s table labels:
- “Racism score (0–5)” vs **“Racism score”**
- “Education (years)” vs **“Education”**
- “Household income per capita (REALINC/HOMPOP)” vs **“Household income per capita”**
- “Occupational prestige (PRESTG80)” vs **“Occupational prestige”**

### Fix
- Change display names to match Table 2 exactly.  
- Keep dataset/internal names (REALINC/HOMPOP, PRESTG80) only in code or appendix.

---

## 4) **Critical: coefficients do not match the published coefficients (Model 1)**
Table below: **Generated (ModelA_Std_Beta)** vs **True (Model 1 coefficient)**.

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong / Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.1279** | 0.130** | Slight numeric mismatch → use the paper’s coefficient if reproducing the table; otherwise your model/spec/sample differs. |
| Education | -0.2077*** | -0.175*** | Substantial mismatch → indicates different sample and/or different coding (education scale, weights, missing handling). |
| Household income pc | 0.0317 | -0.037 | **Sign flips** → your income construction/transform and/or sample differs from the paper. |
| Occupational prestige | 0.0067 | -0.020 | Wrong sign and magnitude. |
| Female | -0.0742 | -0.057 | Magnitude mismatch. |
| Age | 0.1399** | 0.163*** | Magnitude + significance mismatch. |
| Black | -0.1594** | -0.132*** | Magnitude + significance mismatch. |
| Hispanic | -0.0618 | -0.058 | Close (ok-ish). |
| Other race | 0.0175 | -0.017 | **Sign flips**. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.0904 | 0.063 | Too large. |
| No religion | 0.0643 | 0.057 | Slight mismatch. |
| Southern | -0.0145 | 0.024 | **Sign flips**. |

### Fixes (to get exact matches)
To reproduce the *published* coefficients, you must align at least these components with Bryson (1996):

1. **Use the same analytic sample sizes**  
   - True Model 1: **N=644**  
   - Generated Model A: **N=438**  
   Your N is far smaller; this alone will change coefficients.
   - **Fix:** replicate the paper’s inclusion rules (likely: listwise deletion on the full predictor set, plus requiring all genre-like/dislike items needed to construct the DV). Your pipeline is dropping many more cases than Bryson’s.

2. **Apply the same weights (if used) and the same survey design handling**  
   Bryson uses GSS; tables in sociology papers often apply **GSS weights** (e.g., WTSSALL or its predecessor) or specify unweighted—your output doesn’t indicate weighting.
   - **Fix:** check the paper’s methods section for weighting. If weighted, rerun OLS with the correct weight variable.

3. **Match variable coding exactly**
   - **Race dummies:** ensure the same reference group and coding as Bryson. Your “Other race” sign flip suggests a different reference setup or different included categories.
   - **Southern:** confirm definition (Census South vs self-report region vs “born in South”). Wrong sign suggests mismatch.
   - **Income per capita:** paper uses *household income per capita*. Your computation `REALINC/HOMPOP` may not match what Bryson did if REALINC is top-coded, inflation-adjusted differently, or HOMPOP differs from “household size” used in the article.
   - **Fix:** replicate Bryson’s exact construction: confirm the exact GSS income variable/year, whether he uses family income vs respondent income, how household size is measured, and any trimming/top-coding rules.

4. **Use the same year/data subset**  
   Your descriptives say “All 1993”; Bryson (1996) could be using a different year(s) or pooled waves (even if focused on 1993 items).
   - **Fix:** verify the wave(s) used for the music modules and replicate that subset exactly.

If you *do* all of the above, you should be able to reproduce coefficients essentially exactly (modulo rounding).

---

## 5) **Critical: coefficients do not match the published coefficients (Model 2)**
Generated **ModelB_Std_Beta** vs true **Model 2**:

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong / Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.0335 | 0.080 | **Wrong sign and large discrepancy** → sample/coding/model mismatch. |
| Education | -0.2234*** | -0.242*** | Somewhat close but not exact. |
| Household income pc | -0.0309 | -0.065 | Too small in magnitude. |
| Occupational prestige | -0.0321 | 0.005 | Wrong sign. |
| Female | -0.0827 | -0.070 | Close-ish. |
| Age | 0.1014* | 0.126** | Understated and wrong significance. |
| Black | 0.0429 | 0.042 | Essentially matches (good). |
| Hispanic | -0.0911 | -0.029 | Much more negative than true. |
| Other race | 0.0950 | 0.047 | Too large. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.0991 | 0.048 | Too large. |
| No religion | 0.0133 | 0.024 | Too small. |
| Southern | 0.0875 | 0.069 | Too large. |

### Fixes
Same structural issues as Model 1, plus:
- Your **racism coefficient is negative**; Bryson’s is positive (though not significant). That typically points to **either**:
  - wrong DV construction (reverse-coding “dislike” vs “like”), **or**
  - different set of genres included in the “remaining 12,” **or**
  - a restricted/biased analytic sample that changes correlations.
- **Fix:** verify DV2 is computed exactly as “count of disliked among the 12 remaining genres” with the same dislike threshold as Bryson. A common error is treating “neutral” as “dislike” or reversing the scale.

---

## 6) **Model fit statistics mismatch (R², Adjusted R², N)**
### Mismatch
- **Generated Model A:** R²=0.1276, Adj R²=0.1030, **N=438**
- **True Model 1:** R²=0.145, Adj R²=0.129, **N=644**

- **Generated Model B:** R²=0.1341, Adj R²=0.1077, **N=406**
- **True Model 2:** R²=0.147, Adj R²=0.130, **N=605**

### Fix
- This will correct itself only if you replicate:
  - the **same sample definition** (biggest issue),
  - the **same DV construction**,
  - the **same covariate coding**, and
  - any **weights**.

---

## 7) **Constant (intercept) mismatch**
### Mismatch
- **Generated constants (from combined_fit):**
  - Model A constant: 2.695252
  - Model B constant: 5.777225
- **True constants:**
  - Model 1 constant: 2.415***
  - Model 2 constant: 7.860 (no stars shown)

Also, your `modelA_table`/`modelB_table` show **Constant = NaN***, which is internally inconsistent with `combined_fit` where constants exist.

### Fix
1. Ensure the regression summary table is pulling the intercept properly (don’t drop it when you standardize).
2. If you are reporting **standardized coefficients**, be clear:  
   - In many “standardized beta” tables, the **intercept is not standardized** (and often omitted). Bryson *does* print a constant, but the betas are standardized—so his constant is the unstandardized intercept from the unstandardized model.
3. To match Bryson:
   - Report **standardized coefficients for predictors**,
   - Report the **unstandardized intercept** separately (as in the paper),
   - Do not show NaN.

---

## 8) **Significance stars mismatch**
### Mismatch
Model 1 (true):
- Racism ** (you match)
- Education *** (you match stars but coefficient differs)
- Age *** (you show **)
- Black *** (you show **)

Model 2 (true):
- Age ** (you show *)
- Racism has **no stars** (you show none but coefficient sign differs)

### Fix
- Once the coefficients and N match, p-values/stars will usually align.
- Also ensure you use **two-tailed tests** with the same alpha cutoffs (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001).
- If you are using robust SEs or survey corrections while Bryson used conventional OLS SEs (or vice versa), stars will differ. To reproduce the table, use the same inference method as the paper.

---

## 9) **Standard errors: present/absent mismatch**
### Mismatch
- **User request:** “mismatch in … standard errors”
- **True Table 2:** **no standard errors reported**
- **Generated:** also no SEs (good), but your output structure suggests a “Std_Beta / Sig” table only.

### Fix
- Do **not** add standard errors if your goal is to match Bryson’s Table 2.
- If you must compute SEs for your own appendix, label them clearly as “not in Bryson (1996) Table 2.”

---

## 10) **Interpretation mismatch risk (direction of ‘dislike’ count)**
### Mismatch (likely, given sign flips on income/southern/other race and racism in Model 2)
Several sign reversals strongly suggest the DV or key predictors are not coded the same way as in the paper.

### Fix checklist
- Confirm that higher DV values mean **more dislike** (count of genres disliked).
- Confirm the response coding used to define “dislike” (e.g., dislike vs neutral vs like).
- Confirm the exact genre sets:
  - minority-linked 6 = Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin
  - remaining 12 = everything else in that module
- Confirm missing rules: whether “don’t know/NA” are excluded per item and how you treat partial responses when computing the count.

# What you should change in your generated analysis (minimal actionable plan)

1. **Force the analytic sample sizes to match** the paper (Model 1 N=644, Model 2 N=605) by:
   - rebuilding DVs with the paper’s missingness rules,
   - applying the same listwise deletion rule across predictors,
   - using the same GSS wave(s) and restrictions.

2. **Recreate predictor coding exactly**:
   - race dummy scheme and reference category,
   - southern definition,
   - income per capita definition as Bryson implemented it,
   - education scale.

3. **Compute standardized betas the same way** Bryson did:
   - run OLS on unstandardized variables,
   - compute standardized coefficients (or equivalently z-score X and Y before regression),
   - but keep/report the **unstandardized intercept** (to match the printed constant).

4. **Regenerate the table with Bryson’s exact labels** and the true R²/Adj R²/N once the model matches.

If you paste your code (or at least how you constructed both DVs and the sample restriction logic), I can pinpoint exactly where your N collapses from 644→438 and 605→406 and which coding decisions are producing each sign flip.
