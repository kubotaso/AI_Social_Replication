Score: 34/100
============================================================

### 1) Structural problems (why the generated output can’t match the “true” table as-is)

**A. Standard errors are implied/expected but not available**
- **True table** (Bryson 1996 Table 2) reports **standardized coefficients + significance stars only**. It **does not report standard errors**.
- **Generated output**: does not show SEs either, but your prompt asks to compare SEs. That comparison is impossible because **SEs do not exist in the source table**.

**Fix:**  
- Remove any SE columns/claims from the “generated analysis,” or explicitly label SEs as “not reported in Table 2” (or compute them from the microdata if you are re-estimating the model, but then you’re no longer “extracting” from Table 2).

---

**B. You are comparing different models (different DV definitions and likely different samples)**
- **True Model 1 DV**: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” (6 genres).  
  **N = 644**
- **Generated ModelA_fit**: `Table2_ModelA_dislike_minority6` but **N = 327** and **R² = 0.1896** (true is .145).
- **True Model 2 DV**: “Dislike of the 12 remaining genres.”  
  **N = 605**
- **Generated ModelB_fit**: `Table2_ModelB_dislike_other12` but **N = 308** and **R² = 0.1658** (true is .147).

**Fix:**  
- If the goal is to match **Table 2**, you must reproduce **the same analytic sample** and **the same DV construction** as Bryson (1993 GSS; same exclusions/missingness handling; same coding).  
- Your N is roughly half of the paper’s N in both models. That almost certainly indicates a filtering/merging/missing-data rule mismatch (e.g., listwise deletion across extra variables, restricting to a subgroup, or dropping cases due to recodes).

---

### 2) Variable-name alignment issues (generated table has no names; ordering likely mismatched)

Your generated `ModelA_table` and `ModelB_table` show only a column of coefficients with stars and no variable labels. We can infer order by comparing signs/magnitudes, but this is already a **reporting discrepancy**.

**Fix:**  
- Print a table with **explicit variable names in the exact order used in Table 2**:
  1) Racism score  
  2) Education  
  3) Household income per capita  
  4) Occupational prestige  
  5) Female  
  6) Age  
  7) Black  
  8) Hispanic  
  9) Other race  
  10) Conservative Protestant  
  11) No religion  
  12) Southern  
  (+ constant separately)

Also: your generated tables include a `nan` entry, suggesting a missing coefficient (probably a dropped dummy due to collinearity or a coding error).

### 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (assuming the generated rows correspond to Table 2’s variable order)

Below I compare **generated beta_std** to the **true standardized coefficient** from Table 2.

## Model 1 (True) vs Generated ModelA_table

True (Model 1) coefficients:
- Racism 0.130**  
- Education -0.175***  
- Income -0.037  
- Occ prestige -0.020  
- Female -0.057  
- Age 0.163***  
- Black -0.132***  
- Hispanic -0.058  
- Other race -0.017  
- Cons Prot 0.063  
- No religion 0.057  
- Southern 0.024  

Generated ModelA_table betas (11 values + `nan`):
1. 0.139*  
2. -0.261***  
3. -0.034  
4. 0.030  
5. -0.026  
6. 0.191***  
7. -0.127*  
8. 0.004  
9. 0.079  
10. nan  
11. 0.022  

### Mismatches
- **Racism:** generated **0.139***?* vs true **0.130**. Close in magnitude but **wrong significance** (true is **, generated is *).
- **Education:** generated **-0.261*** vs true **-0.175*** (too large in magnitude).
- **Income:** generated **-0.034** vs true **-0.037** (close).
- **Occupational prestige:** generated **+0.030** vs true **-0.020** (**wrong sign**).
- **Female:** generated **-0.026** vs true **-0.057** (too small; possibly not significant in generated, consistent with but not matching value).
- **Age:** generated **0.191*** vs true **0.163*** (too large).
- **Black:** generated **-0.127***?* vs true **-0.132*** (magnitude close, but **significance is wrong**: true ***, generated *).
- **Hispanic:** generated **0.004** vs true **-0.058** (**wrong sign and much smaller**).
- **Other race:** generated **0.079** vs true **-0.017** (**wrong sign and much larger**).
- **Conservative Protestant:** generated is **nan** (coefficient missing entirely) vs true **0.063**.
- **No religion / Southern:** generated has only one remaining coefficient **0.022** but true has **two**: **0.057** and **0.024**. So at least one variable is missing and/or the ordering is wrong.

### Interpretation mismatches implied by these
- Any narrative claiming occupational prestige increases dislike (because generated is +0.030) would contradict the table (true is slightly negative).
- Any narrative about Hispanics/Other race increasing dislike would contradict the table (true coefficients are negative/small).

**Fixes (Model 1):**
1) **Add variable labels** and ensure the coefficient vector maps to the correct predictors.  
2) **Resolve `nan`**: almost always caused by:
   - perfect multicollinearity (e.g., you included all religion dummies *plus* an intercept; or all race dummies plus intercept),
   - a dummy variable with no variation in the estimation sample,
   - or an accidental merge creating missingness.
   **Fix:** use a proper reference category (drop one dummy per set), verify variation, and check model matrix rank.
3) **Match sample size (N=644)** by replicating Bryson’s listwise deletion exactly (and not deleting extra cases due to your own constructed variables).
4) Ensure the DV is exactly the count of “disliked” across the specified 6 genres and coded identically.

## Model 2 (True) vs Generated ModelB_table

True (Model 2) coefficients:
- Racism 0.080  
- Education -0.242***  
- Income -0.065  
- Occ prestige 0.005  
- Female -0.070  
- Age 0.126**  
- Black 0.042  
- Hispanic -0.029  
- Other race 0.047  
- Cons Prot 0.048  
- No religion 0.024  
- Southern 0.069  

Generated ModelB_table betas (10 values + `nan` = 11 entries):
1. -0.005  
2. -0.224***  
3. -0.095  
4. -0.012  
5. -0.091  
6. 0.091  
7. 0.112  
8. 0.132*  
9. 0.080  
10. nan  
11. 0.142**  

### Mismatches
- **Racism:** generated **-0.005** vs true **+0.080** (**wrong sign** and far from table).
- **Education:** generated **-0.224*** vs true **-0.242*** (close-ish).
- **Income:** generated **-0.095** vs true **-0.065** (too negative).
- **Occupational prestige:** generated **-0.012** vs true **+0.005** (wrong sign but small).
- **Female:** generated **-0.091** vs true **-0.070** (more negative).
- **Age:** generated **0.091** vs true **0.126** (too small and missing the ** significance).
- **Black:** generated **0.112** vs true **0.042** (too large).
- **Hispanic:** generated **0.132*** vs true **-0.029** (**wrong sign**).
- **Other race:** generated **0.080** vs true **0.047** (too large).
- **Conservative Protestant:** `nan` vs true **0.048** (missing).
- Remaining coefficient **0.142** doesn’t correspond to any true coefficient (No religion 0.024; Southern 0.069). So again: missing variables and/or ordering mismatch.

**Fixes (Model 2):**
- Same as Model 1: variable naming, dummy reference categories, ensure predictors match exactly, fix multicollinearity causing `nan`, and match the paper’s sample selection (N=605).
- Critically: fix the **racism score** construction and/or coding direction. A sign flip (true positive, generated near zero/negative) strongly suggests your racism scale is reversed, rescaled, or computed on a different subset of items.

### 4) Model fit mismatches (R², adjusted R², constant)

**Model 1 fit**
- True: R² = .145; Adj R² = .129; N=644; Constant = 2.415***  
- Generated: R² = 0.1896; Adj R² = 0.1639; N=327; Constant_b = 2.6536  

Mismatches:
- **N wrong** (biggest issue)
- **R²/Adj R² too high** (likely due to sample restriction or different DV coding)
- **Constant differs** (expected if DV or sample differs)

**Model 2 fit**
- True: R² = .147; Adj R² = .130; N=605; Constant = 7.860  
- Generated: R² = 0.1658; Adj R² = 0.1377; N=308; Constant_b = 5.6737  

Mismatches:
- **N wrong**
- **Constant is far off** (7.86 vs 5.67) strongly suggests DV is not constructed the same way (e.g., different number of genres available, different dislike threshold, missing genre items).

**Fix:**
- Rebuild both DVs exactly as Bryson did (same genre list per DV, same coding of “dislike,” same handling of “don’t know,” “not asked,” etc.).
- Ensure you are using the correct GSS year (1993) and the same weight policy (if any; Table 2 may be unweighted—verify paper’s methods section).

### 5) Reporting/interpretation mismatches to correct in the generated analysis

1) **Do not report SEs** as if they come from Table 2.  
2) **Do not interpret `nan` as “no effect”**—it indicates a modeling/data error (dropped term), not a null finding.
3) **Significance stars must match the table** if you are “reproducing Table 2.” If you are re-estimating from microdata, your p-values may differ, but then you must say you are *replicating* rather than *extracting*.

---

### Practical checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1) **Use the correct dataset/year**: GSS 1993, same inclusion criteria as Bryson.  
2) **Construct DVs identically**:
   - DV1 = count of dislikes among the 6 specified genres  
   - DV2 = count of dislikes among the remaining 12 genres  
3) **Construct predictors identically** (especially **racism score**; confirm direction).  
4) **Apply the same missing-data rule** (likely listwise deletion on variables in the model, but not additional variables). Target **N=644** and **N=605**.  
5) **Fix dummy-variable coding**:
   - Race: choose a reference (likely White) and include Black, Hispanic, Other race dummies.
   - Religion: choose a reference (likely mainline/other Protestant or Catholic depending on Bryson) and include Cons Prot and No religion as dummies.
   - Include intercept; do not include all category dummies.
6) **Output a labeled table** with variables in the exact Table 2 order and include only standardized coefficients + significance markers.

If you paste the code (or at least the variable list and how you built the racism scale and the two DV counts), I can pinpoint exactly which recode or sample restriction is producing the halved N and the sign flips for Hispanic/racism.
