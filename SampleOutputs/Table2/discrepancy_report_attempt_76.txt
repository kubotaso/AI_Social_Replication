Score: 34/100
============================================================

Below is a complete item-by-item reconciliation of the **generated** vs **true (Bryson 1996 Table 2)** results, covering **variable names, coefficients, missingness/NaNs, fit stats (N/R²/Adj R²), constants, and interpretation/significance**—plus concrete fixes to make the generated output match the paper.

---

## 1) Variables present: name mismatches and omissions

### 1.1 “Hispanic” is incorrectly dropped (NaN) in both generated models
- **Generated:** `Hispanic` coefficient is `NaN` in Model 1 and Model 2, and `fit_stats` says `Dropped_all_missing: hispanic`.
- **True:** Hispanic is included with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **-0.058** (not significant)
  - Model 2: **-0.029** (not significant)

**Fix**
- Do not drop `Hispanic`. The paper clearly includes it, so your analytic sample construction is inconsistent with the published model.
- Likely causes:
  1) You used a dataset version where Hispanic is missing for all remaining cases after other filters, or
  2) You incorrectly recoded Hispanic (e.g., created a dummy but never populated it), or
  3) You listwise-deleted on Hispanic inadvertently.
- Implementation fix:
  - Ensure Hispanic dummy is properly created (e.g., `hispanic = 1 if race==Hispanic else 0`) and is not all-missing.
  - Recreate the analytic sample exactly as Bryson did (same survey/year; same race coding; same missing-data rules).

### 1.2 “Other race” sign mismatch (Model 1)
- **Generated Model 1:** `Other race = +0.010867`
- **True Model 1:** `Other race = -0.017`

**Fix**
- Confirm the reference category and dummy coding. Bryson’s table implies White is the reference, with dummies for Black, Hispanic, Other.
- If you accidentally used a different reference (or effect coding), signs can flip or shift.

### 1.3 Occupational prestige sign mismatch (Model 2)
- **Generated Model 2:** `Occupational prestige = -0.012431`
- **True Model 2:** `Occupational prestige = +0.005`

**Fix**
- Verify prestige measure scaling and whether it was standardized correctly. Also verify you are using the same prestige variable Bryson used (e.g., Duncan SEI vs NORC).
- If you standardized using the analytic sample but Bryson standardized using a different base (or used raw then standardized betas from the model), you can get small differences—though the sign flip suggests a coding mismatch or a different variable.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (by model)

### 2.1 Model 1 coefficient mismatches
True Model 1 coefficients vs generated:

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.131833** | 0.130** | close (rounding) |
| Education | -0.180139*** | -0.175*** | slightly off |
| Household income per capita | **+0.008961** | **-0.037** | **wrong sign & magnitude** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.019019 | -0.020 | close |
| Female | -0.071658 | -0.057 | off |
| Age | 0.156851*** | 0.163*** | slightly off |
| Black | -0.141030** | -0.132*** | **sig level wrong + coef off** |
| Hispanic | NaN | -0.058 | **missing** |
| Other race | +0.010867 | -0.017 | **wrong sign** |
| Conservative Protestant | +0.083766 | +0.063 | off |
| No religion | +0.068263 | +0.057 | off |
| Southern | +0.026711 | +0.024 | close |
| Constant | 2.461148*** | 2.415*** | off |

**Key problems needing correction (Model 1):**
1) Income sign is wrong (should be negative).
2) Hispanic missing (must be included).
3) Other race sign is wrong.
4) Black significance level differs (** vs ***).

### 2.2 Model 2 coefficient mismatches
True Model 2 coefficients vs generated:

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **-0.002233** | **+0.080** | **wrong sign & magnitude** |
| Education | -0.194316*** | -0.242*** | too small in magnitude |
| Household income per capita | -0.035654 | -0.065 | off |
| Occupational prestige | -0.012431 | +0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.069205 | -0.070 | close |
| Age | 0.119317** | 0.126** | close |
| Black | 0.066914 | 0.042 | off |
| Hispanic | NaN | -0.029 | **missing** |
| Other race | 0.076128 | 0.047 | off |
| Conservative Protestant | **0.101269*** | 0.048 | **too large & wrong sig** |
| No religion | 0.018895 | 0.024 | close |
| Southern | 0.075385 | 0.069 | close |
| Constant | **4.957739*** | **7.860** | **wrong value & wrongly starred** |

**Key problems needing correction (Model 2):**
1) Racism effect is fundamentally wrong (near zero negative vs +0.080).
2) Constant is very wrong (and should not be starred; paper prints “7.860” with no sig marking).
3) Conservative Protestant is far too large and incorrectly significant.
4) Hispanic missing again.

---

## 3) Standard errors: generated output incorrectly implies SEs/significance mechanics

- **True:** Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients only** and **no standard errors**.
- **Generated:** Does not print SEs, but prints significance stars derived from *something* (implied p-values), and the constant is marked significant in Model 2 though the paper does not even star it (and prints 7.860).

**Fix**
- If your goal is to match Bryson’s Table 2, you must:
  - either **remove all significance stars** entirely (since SEs/p-values aren’t reported), **OR**
  - compute p-values from the underlying regression and then star them—but then you must match Bryson’s p-values/sample exactly (which you currently don’t, given N and coefficients differ).
- The clean “match-the-table” fix: **report only coefficients with Bryson’s stars** as printed, without claiming they were computed from your run.

---

## 4) Fit statistics mismatches (N, R², Adj R²)

### 4.1 Sample size N is wrong in both models
- **Generated N:**
  - Model 1: **549**
  - Model 2: **507**
- **True N:**
  - Model 1: **644**
  - Model 2: **605**

**Fix**
- Your analytic sample selection is not the same as Bryson’s (almost certainly due to:
  - dropping Hispanic entirely,
  - additional listwise deletion on variables Bryson retained (or used different imputation/handling),
  - using a different source dataset or different year, or
  - restricting to respondents with complete DV components in a way Bryson did not).
- To match:
  1) Use the same dataset and wave as Bryson (GSS-related work often differs by year/combined years).
  2) Reconstruct the DV counts exactly as described in Bryson (including how “dislike” is defined and how missing genre responses are handled).
  3) Apply the same missing-data rule used in the paper (often listwise on model variables, but your current drop pattern is too aggressive and inconsistent with published N).

### 4.2 R² and Adjusted R² are wrong
- **Generated:**
  - Model 1: R² **0.133**, Adj R² **0.115**
  - Model 2: R² **0.120**, Adj R² **0.100**
- **True:**
  - Model 1: R² **0.145**, Adj R² **0.129**
  - Model 2: R² **0.147**, Adj R² **0.130**

**Fix**
- Once you match the sample (N) and variable coding, R² should come much closer. Right now, your models are not the same estimation problem.

---

## 5) Constant / intercept mismatches and interpretation problems

### 5.1 Model 2 constant is completely inconsistent
- **Generated:** Constant = **4.957739*** (and starred)
- **True:** Constant = **7.860** (no stars shown)

**Fix**
- First: ensure you are not mistakenly reporting a standardized intercept as if it were unstandardized, or vice versa.
- Bryson’s table lists a constant even though coefficients are standardized—this can happen if:
  - the DV is not standardized but predictors are standardized (or if “standardized coefficients” refers only to slopes).
- To match Bryson:
  - replicate exactly how “standardized OLS coefficients” were produced (often: report standardized betas for slopes, but intercept from the unstandardized model).
- Also: do not invent significance stars for the constant when matching a printed table that does not mark it significant.

### 5.2 Model 1 constant differs
- **Generated:** 2.461148***
- **True:** 2.415***

**Fix**
- Same issue: intercept computation depends on whether DV/predictors were standardized and what centering was used. Match Bryson’s procedure.

---

## 6) Significance/interpretation mismatches

### 6.1 Wrong significance level for Black in Model 1
- **Generated:** Black has `**`
- **True:** Black has `***`

**Fix**
- This will resolve only if you match the exact sample, coding, and model estimation that Bryson used.

### 6.2 Wrong significance marking for Conservative Protestant in Model 2
- **Generated:** `Conservative Protestant = 0.101*`
- **True:** `0.048` (no star)

**Fix**
- Again, sample/coding mismatch. Also check that you didn’t define “Conservative Protestant” differently (denomination classification schemes vary).

### 6.3 Racism score in Model 2: wrong direction leads to wrong substantive interpretation
- **Generated:** racism ~ 0 (slightly negative), implying racism does not increase dislike of remaining genres.
- **True:** racism is **positive (0.080)**, implying higher racism is associated with *more* dislike even outside “minority-linked” genres (though not significant in table).

**Fix**
- This is a major substantive failure: it almost certainly reflects that your DV2 construction is not Bryson’s DV2, or your racism scale is reversed (higher = less racist).
- Verify racism scale direction:
  - If your racism measure is reverse-coded relative to Bryson, signs for racism will flip in both models (but your Model 1 racism is positive and close to true, so the scale probably isn’t reversed; that points back to DV2 construction/sample).

---

## 7) “Standardized OLS coefficients” vs what you actually estimated

Your generated tables label everything “Std. beta” but:
- intercepts are not standardized betas,
- the DV appears to be a count (0–6, 0–12),
- and your results do not match Bryson’s betas or intercepts.

**Fix (procedural)**
To match Table 2, implement *exactly*:
1) **DV construction**:
   - Model 1 DV: count of dislikes among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}.
   - Model 2 DV: count of dislikes among the other 12 genres.
   - Ensure identical dislike coding thresholds and missing handling (e.g., what if a respondent never rated “Latin”?).
2) **Predictor coding**:
   - Racism scale: same items, same direction, same handling of missing.
   - Education: years vs degree categories (Bryson uses “Education”; likely years).
   - Income per capita: confirm per-capita transformation and units (log? dollars?); your “income_pc” values suggest raw dollars; Bryson’s coefficient signs suggest a different scaling and/or inclusion.
   - Prestige: same index.
   - Religion: “Conservative Protestant” classification must match Bryson’s coding scheme.
   - Region: “Southern” definition must match (Census South).
   - Race dummies: White reference, include Black/Hispanic/Other.
3) **Standardization rules**:
   - Standardize predictors to mean 0, SD 1 (within the analytic sample).
   - Use OLS on the original DV counts (likely unstandardized), then compute standardized betas for slopes.
   - Report intercept from the unstandardized model (consistent with Bryson printing constants like 2.415 and 7.860).

## 8) Summary of “every mismatch” checklist

### Must-fix mismatches (hard errors)
- Hispanic is missing (NaN) in both models (should be -0.058 and -0.029).
- Model 2 racism coefficient wrong (should be +0.080).
- Model 1 income coefficient wrong sign (should be -0.037).
- Model 1 Other race wrong sign (should be -0.017).
- Model 2 occupational prestige wrong sign (should be +0.005).
- Model 2 constant wrong (should be 7.860; and don’t star it when matching the table).
- N, R², Adj R² wrong for both models.

### Likely-to-resolve-after-sample/coding alignment (soft mismatches)
- Small numeric differences for education/age/southern/no religion/constant Model 1.
- Black coefficient size and significance in Model 1.
- Conservative Protestant effect size and significance in Model 2.

---

If you tell me (a) what dataset you used (GSS year(s)?), (b) how you coded “dislike,” and (c) how you built the racism score and Conservative Protestant classification, I can pinpoint which specific coding step is producing each sign flip (especially income, other race, prestige, and racism in Model 2).
