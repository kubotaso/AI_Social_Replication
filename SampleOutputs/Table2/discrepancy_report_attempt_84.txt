Score: 30/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

**A. “Hispanic” is missing in both generated models**
- **True Table 2 includes Hispanic in both models** (Model 1: −0.058; Model 2: −0.029).
- **Generated output explicitly says Hispanic excluded**.
- **Fix:** You must recreate the Hispanic indicator exactly as in Bryson (1996) and include it in both regressions. If your extract truly lacks Hispanic, you cannot claim you reproduced Table 2; you must either (i) obtain the correct 1993 GSS variables, or (ii) relabel your result as “partial replication excluding Hispanic” and note coefficients are not comparable.

**B. “No religion” is present but blank in the generated coefficient tables**
- In the generated tables, **No religion has no coefficient shown**, yet the fit table says “dropped_after_standardization = no_religion.”
- True Table 2 includes **No religion** in both models (Model 1: 0.057; Model 2: 0.024).
- **Fix:** Determine why “No religion” is being dropped:
  - If it was dropped due to **zero variance** (all 0/1), coding is wrong.
  - If dropped due to **perfect collinearity**, your reference category is mis-specified (e.g., including all religion dummies + intercept).
  - If dropped because of **standardization code**, you may be standardizing binary dummies incorrectly and accidentally producing NA/constant values after filtering.
  - Correct approach: keep intercept and omit one religious category as reference, or construct a single “no religion” dummy with a clear reference (e.g., “any religion”).

**C. Model labels/DVs do not match the paper’s wording**
- Generated: `Dislike_Minority_Associated6` and `Dislike_Other12_Remaining` (close but not the paper’s titles).
- True: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” and “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres.”
- **Fix:** Align DV construction and naming exactly; especially ensure the *same six genres* are used and that “Latin music” is included in Model 1’s DV.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (direction, magnitude, significance)

Below I list **every variable where the generated standardized beta differs from the true standardized coefficient** (including sign flips and significance mismatches).

## Model 1 (true N=644) vs Generated ModelA (N=327)

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.139* | 0.130** | Similar magnitude, **wrong sig level** | Use correct N/spec; ensure same SE/df if you’re computing p-stars; otherwise copy stars from table (since Table 2 provides them). |
| Education | -0.261*** | -0.175*** | Too large in magnitude | Indicates different sample, different standardization, or different DV construction. Fix N, weights, missing-data handling, DV. |
| Household income per capita | -0.034 | -0.037 | Close | Minor; will resolve with correct sample/spec. |
| Occupational prestige | 0.030 | -0.020 | **Sign flip** | Likely variable coding mismatch (prestige scale direction), different prestige variable, or sample differences. Use the same prestige measure and coding as Bryson/GSS. |
| Female | -0.026 | -0.057 | Too small in magnitude | Sample/spec mismatch; also check coding (0/1 vs 1/2) before standardization. |
| Age | 0.191*** | 0.163*** | Too large | Sample/spec mismatch and/or age coding (years vs categories). |
| Black | -0.127* | -0.132*** | Similar coefficient but **stars way off** | Stars depend on N and model SEs; fix N/spec; don’t invent stars if you’re not reproducing exact SEs. |
| Hispanic | (missing) | -0.058 | Omitted | Add Hispanic indicator. |
| Other race | 0.004 | -0.017 | Wrong sign and magnitude | Race coding/omitted category mismatch and missing Hispanic can distort “Other race.” Fix race dummies to match paper. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.079 | 0.063 | Slightly high | Sample/spec mismatch. |
| No religion | (dropped/blank) | 0.057 | Dropped | Fix collinearity/coding as above. |
| Southern | 0.022 | 0.024 | Close | Minor. |
| Constant | 2.654*** | 2.415*** | Different | Different DV mean due to DV construction and/or sample. Fix DV and sample. |

**Big structural mismatch:** **N is 327 generated vs 644 true**, which alone will change coefficients (because you’re fitting on a different subset) and will absolutely change significance.

## Model 2 (true N=605) vs Generated ModelB (N=308)

| Variable | Generated | True | What’s wrong | How to fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.005 | 0.080 | **Sign + magnitude totally wrong** | DV likely constructed differently; also sample mismatch (N ~ half). Ensure you used the same 12-genre DV and same racism scale. |
| Education | -0.224*** | -0.242*** | Somewhat close | Will tighten with correct sample/spec. |
| Household income per capita | -0.095 | -0.065 | Too negative | Sample/spec mismatch; check income-per-capita construction and any transformations. |
| Occupational prestige | -0.012 | 0.005 | Wrong sign | Prestige variable/coding mismatch as in Model 1. |
| Female | -0.091 | -0.070 | Slightly too negative and missing star (true has none) | Star assignment depends on SE; fix N/spec and compute p-values properly. |
| Age | 0.091 | 0.126** | Too small and missing ** | Sample/spec mismatch; possible age coding mismatch. |
| Black | 0.112 | 0.042 | Much too large | Race coding mismatch; missing Hispanic; sample restriction issues. |
| Hispanic | (missing) | -0.029 | Omitted | Add Hispanic. |
| Other race | 0.132* | 0.047 | Much too large | Race coding mismatch / missing Hispanic / sample restriction. |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.080 | 0.048 | Too large | Sample/spec mismatch. |
| No religion | (dropped/blank) | 0.024 | Dropped | Fix coding/collinearity. |
| Southern | 0.142** | 0.069 | About double and wrong significance | Sample/spec mismatch; possibly “South” variable definition differs (region vs born in South, etc.). |
| Constant | 5.674*** | 7.860 (no stars shown) | Large mismatch and stars mismatch | DV construction and sample mismatch; also Table 2 may not star the constant the same way (and may not even test it as you do). |

**Again structural mismatch:** **N is 308 generated vs 605 true**.

### 3) Fit statistics mismatches

**Model 1**
- Generated: **N=327; R²=0.1896; Adj R²=0.1639**
- True: **N=644; R²=0.145; Adj R²=0.129**
- **Fix:** Use the same sample definition as Bryson:
  - Same year (GSS 1993)
  - Same inclusion/exclusion rules
  - Same handling of missingness (likely listwise deletion on variables in the model)
  - Same weights (if the paper used weights—check; if you used weights and the paper didn’t, or vice versa, coefficients and R² differ)

**Model 2**
- Generated: **N=308; R²=0.1658; Adj R²=0.1377**
- True: **N=605; R²=0.147; Adj R²=0.130**
- **Fix:** same as above; also confirm the *exact set of 12 genres* and how “dislike” is counted.

---

### 4) Standard errors: generated vs true

- You were asked to compare SEs too, but **the true table reports no SEs**.
- The generated output also **does not provide SEs**, despite the prompt mentioning them.
- **Mismatch in interpretation:** If your generated narrative implied SEs came from Table 2 or that you “matched” SEs, that’s incorrect.
- **Fix:**  
  1) Do not claim SEs come from the paper’s Table 2.  
  2) If you want SEs, you must **re-estimate the models in microdata** and report your computed SEs (and then you’re doing a replication, not extracting from the table).  
  3) Make star annotations from **your computed p-values**, but then they will only match the paper if your sample/spec matches exactly.

---

### 5) Interpretation/significance marker problems

**A. Stars don’t match the paper**
- Example: Model 1 racism is ** in true but only * in generated.
- Model 1 black is *** in true but only * in generated.
- Model 2 age is ** in true but none in generated.
- **Fix:** Stars depend on SEs and df. Once you fix the sample (N) and specification, compute p-values consistently (two-tailed) using the same α thresholds (* .05, ** .01, *** .001). If you cannot reproduce N/spec, do not copy the paper’s stars.

**B. Racism score in Model 2 is the biggest substantive mismatch**
- True: **positive (0.080)**; Generated: ~0 and negative.
- **Fix priorities:** (1) correct DV construction (12 remaining genres), (2) correct racism scale construction, (3) correct sample size and missingness, (4) include Hispanic and no religion correctly.

### 6) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1) **Use the correct dataset and year:** GSS 1993 (same extract the author used).
2) **Rebuild both dependent variables exactly:**
   - Model 1 DV = count of dislikes among the six listed genres (must include Latin).
   - Model 2 DV = count of dislikes among the *other 12* genres (verify the exact 12 from the paper).
3) **Rebuild “racism score” exactly** (items, coding direction, missing handling, scaling). Small differences here can change coefficients materially.
4) **Recode all categorical predictors exactly**:
   - Female as 0/1 (not 1/2) before standardizing.
   - Race dummies: Black, Hispanic, Other race with White as reference (and include all that the table includes).
   - Religion: Conservative Protestant and No religion with an appropriate reference category; do not include a full set of mutually exclusive dummies with an intercept.
   - Southern definition consistent with paper (region of residence in South vs something else).
5) **Match the estimation sample (N):**
   - Apply the same listwise deletion rules used in the paper.
   - Don’t inadvertently restrict to a subsample (e.g., only those with complete music-module responses if the paper used imputation or different rules—check).
6) **Standardization procedure:**
   - The table reports *standardized OLS coefficients* (beta). Standardize continuous variables consistently; for dummies, beta depends on whether you standardize the dummy—Bryson’s “standardized coefficient” typically means the regression was run on standardized variables or betas computed post hoc. Match the method.
7) **Report:** Do not report SEs as “from Table 2.” If you compute them, label them as replication outputs.

If you want, paste (a) your variable construction code for the two DVs, (b) how “racism score” is built, and (c) your sample-filtering/missing-data rules; those three pieces usually explain ~90% of the coefficient and N discrepancies.
