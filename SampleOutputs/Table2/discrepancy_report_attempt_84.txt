Score: 37/100
============================================================

Below is a complete item-by-item audit of where the **Generated Results** diverge from Bryson (1996) Table 2 “true” results, plus concrete fixes to make the generated analysis match the published table.

---

## 1) Model identification, DV definitions, and sample sizes (major mismatches)

### 1.1 DV labels match in spirit but the **models are not the same analyses**
- **True Model 1 DV:** *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music* (count of 6).
- **Generated Model 1 DV:** Same description (count of 6). ✅

- **True Model 2 DV:** *Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres* (count of 12).
- **Generated Model 2 DV:** Same description (count of 12). ✅

**But** the model results do not correspond to Bryson’s reported coefficients and fit statistics, which strongly suggests the generated models were re-estimated on a different dataset, different years, different weights, different missing-data handling, or different variable construction.

### 1.2 N is wrong in both models
- **True N:** Model 1 = **644**, Model 2 = **605**
- **Generated N:** Model 1 = **549**, Model 2 = **507**
- **Fix:** Recreate Bryson’s analytic sample rules:
  - Use the same survey wave(s) and same subsample restrictions as Bryson (likely GSS year(s) used in the paper).
  - Apply the same missing-data approach (likely listwise deletion on *all* regressors used in each model).
  - Apply the same weights if Bryson used them (many GSS analyses do; paper should indicate). If weights were used, use **weighted OLS**.

### 1.3 R² / Adjusted R² are wrong
- **True:** Model 1 R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**; Model 2 R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**
- **Generated:** Model 1 R² = **0.133**, Adj R² = **0.115**; Model 2 R² = **0.120**, Adj R² = **0.100**
- **Fix:** Once you match the sample and variable construction (and weights), the fit should move toward the published values. Right now it’s a red flag that you’re not reproducing the same dataset/spec.

---

## 2) Variable name mismatches / missing variables

### 2.1 “Hispanic” is missing in generated tables
- **True:** Hispanic is included in both models (Model 1 = -0.058; Model 2 = -0.029).
- **Generated:** Hispanic is **NaN / “not available in this extract”** (i.e., it was not actually estimated or not extracted).
- **Fix:** Ensure the Hispanic indicator is:
  - Present in the modeling dataframe and not dropped.
  - Coded as Bryson did (likely a dummy; reference category probably White non-Hispanic).
  - Included in the regression formula and in the output extraction routine.

### 2.2 Race categories likely not aligned with Bryson’s reference coding
Even where “Black” and “Other race” exist, the coefficients differ in sign/magnitude (see below). That can happen if:
- Hispanic is treated as a race category vs an ethnicity overlay,
- the omitted/reference group differs,
- multi-category race coding differs.

**Fix:** Rebuild race/ethnicity exactly as Bryson’s Table 2 implies:
- Dummies: **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race** with **White** as reference (most common in that era’s tables).

---

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (every variable)

Important: Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients (betas)** for predictors; the **constant is unstandardized**. Your generated tables claim “std. beta,” but many betas do not match, and some signs differ—so either:
- they aren’t actually standardized in the same way, and/or
- the underlying variables/DVs are constructed differently, and/or
- the sample/weights differ.

### 3.1 Model 1 mismatches (DV: minority-linked genres, 6)

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.131833** | ~matches (tiny rounding diff) ✅ |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.180139*** | too negative |
| Household income per capita | **-0.037** | **+0.008961** | **wrong sign** (major) |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | -0.019019 | close ✅ |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.071658 | too negative |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.156851*** | slightly low |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.141030** | sig level wrong (** vs ***) and magnitude off |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | NaN | missing entirely |
| Other race | -0.017 | +0.010867 | **wrong sign** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.083766 | too high |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.068263 | too high |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.026711 | close ✅ |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.461148*** | too high |

**Fixes implied by the pattern:**
- The fact that *Racism score* and *Occupational prestige* are close while income and “Other race” flip sign suggests **variable construction differences** (income scaling/logging/topcoding; race coding), and/or **standardization differences** (e.g., standardizing after listwise deletion vs before; or using weighted SDs vs unweighted).
- Match Bryson’s handling of:
  - income per capita definition (maybe logged? maybe categories?),
  - occupational prestige scale,
  - race/ethnicity dummies,
  - any weighting.

### 3.2 Model 2 mismatches (DV: remaining 12 genres)

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.002233 | **wrong sign & near zero** (major) |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.194316*** | not negative enough (major) |
| Household income per capita | -0.065 | -0.035654 | not negative enough |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.012431 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.069205 | close ✅ |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.119317** | close ✅ |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.066914 | too high |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | NaN | missing entirely |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.076128 | too high |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.101269* | much too high; sig marker shouldn’t be * |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.018895 | close-ish |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.075385 | close ✅ |
| Constant | 7.860 | 4.957739 | far too low |

**Fixes implied by the pattern:**
- The *Racism score* discrepancy (0.080 vs ~0.00 and negative) is huge and not a rounding issue. It almost certainly means at least one of:
  1) DV for model 2 not constructed identically (which genres counted, dislike threshold, missing recodes),
  2) racism scale constructed differently (range, reverse coding, items, standardization),
  3) wrong sample/year/weights.
- Occupational prestige sign flip also indicates either different prestige measure or miscoding.

## 4) Significance markers are inconsistent with the published table

### 4.1 “Black” significance in Model 1
- **True:** Black = -0.132***  
- **Generated:** Black = -0.141030 **  
- **Fix:** Once you replicate the same N/SEs (through same sample & model), the p-value should align. Also verify your significance-star thresholds match the paper’s:  
  \* p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001.

### 4.2 Conservative Protestant in Model 2
- **True:** 0.048 (no star)  
- **Generated:** 0.101269 *  
- **Fix:** This should lose significance once the correct sample/spec is used; also check you are not using one-tailed tests or robust SEs (even though Table 2 doesn’t show SEs, the stars come from some SE choice—likely conventional OLS).

---

## 5) Constants: interpretation and scaling problems

### 5.1 Model 2 constant is radically different
- **True Constant (Model 2):** 7.860  
- **Generated Constant (Model 2):** 4.957739
- **Fix:** Intercepts are extremely sensitive to:
  - whether the DV is exactly the same count and range,
  - centering/standardization choices (you should **not** standardize the DV if you want Bryson’s intercept),
  - inclusion/exclusion of cases,
  - coding of dummies and reference categories.

To match Bryson:
- Keep DV unstandardized counts exactly as in paper.
- Standardize predictors only (to get betas), but compute/display intercept from the unstandardized model consistent with Table 2.

---

## 6) Standard errors: generated output omits them (and that’s correct), but the *request* mentions SEs

- **True table:** does **not** report standard errors.
- **Generated output:** also does **not** provide SEs. ✅

However, your generated tables include significance stars, which implies SEs/p-values were computed internally. That’s fine; just don’t claim SEs are from the paper.

**Fix to align reporting:** In the generated narrative/table notes, explicitly state:
- “Standard errors are not shown because the published Table 2 does not report them; stars are taken from the published table (or computed from OLS if reproducing).”

Right now, the generated analysis is mixing “extracted” model output with missing Hispanic and mismatched coefficients, so the stars are not comparable anyway.

---

## 7) Interpretation errors (implicit)

Even when the signs match, interpretation must follow *standardized beta* meaning:

- A beta is the expected SD change in DV per 1 SD change in predictor, holding others constant.
- Your generated tables label most coefficients as “included (std. beta)” but then treat constants and some outputs as if they’re directly comparable across models without ensuring the same standardization protocol.

**Fix:** Ensure:
- Predictors are standardized using the same sample used in each model (after listwise deletion), and ideally with the same weighting approach if weights are used.
- The DV is **not** standardized (to keep intercept comparable to Bryson’s reported intercept).

---

## 8) Concrete steps to “fix” so the generated analysis matches Bryson (1996)

1) **Use the same dataset/year(s) and restrictions** as Bryson (1996).
   - The N differences (644/605 vs 549/507) are too large to be rounding.

2) **Reconstruct the two DVs exactly**:
   - Ensure the same list of genres in each DV.
   - Ensure “dislike” threshold matches (e.g., “dislike” vs “strongly dislike,” treatment of “don’t know,” missing, never heard, etc.).
   - Ensure DV is a **count** over 6 and 12 respectively with the same missing-data rules.

3) **Reconstruct independent variables exactly**:
   - Racism score: same items, same coding direction, same scale construction, and same missing handling.
   - Income per capita: same definition and any transformations (per-capita division rules, topcodes, log/linear).
   - Occupational prestige: same prestige scale and coding.
   - Race/ethnicity: create **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race** dummies with **White** as reference.

4) **Apply the correct estimation protocol**:
   - Weighted vs unweighted OLS as per paper.
   - Listwise deletion across the model’s variables.

5) **Standardize predictors appropriately to get betas**:
   - Compute standardized coefficients in the same way as the publication (typically: run OLS on unstandardized variables, then convert to betas via \( \beta_j = b_j \cdot \frac{s_{xj}}{s_y} \); if weighted, use weighted SDs).
   - Do **not** standardize the DV if you want the published intercept.

6) **Fix the extraction/reporting layer**:
   - Ensure Hispanic is not dropped from the coefficient table.
   - Ensure sign and values are reported with Bryson’s rounding (three decimals typically, plus stars).

---

If you want, paste (a) your code that builds the DVs and racism score, and (b) how you standardize coefficients and handle weights/missingness, and I can pinpoint which specific construction step is producing the sign flips for income/other race (Model 1) and the near-zero racism effect (Model 2).
