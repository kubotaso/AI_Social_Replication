### 1) Sample size / model fit mismatches (major)

**Mismatch**
- **N**: Generated uses **261 (Model 1)** and **259 (Model 2)**. True table has **644 (Model 1)** and **605 (Model 2)**.
- **R² / Adj. R²**: Generated has **R²=0.166 / Adj=0.129 (M1)** and **R²=0.137 / Adj=0.099 (M2)**. True has **R²=0.145 / Adj=0.129 (M1)** and **R²=0.147 / Adj=0.130 (M2)**.
- **Constant**: Generated **2.570*** (M1) and **5.233*** (M2). True **2.415*** (M1) and **7.860** (M2; no stars printed).

**Why it happened**
- Your generated analysis is not reproducing Bryson’s analytic sample (likely wrong year/subset, excessive listwise deletion, and/or incorrect handling of missing values and scale construction).
- The “Model 2 constant” is especially diagnostic: if the DV is a count from 0–12 with mean ~3.78 (as your descriptives show), you cannot get a constant remotely like 7.86 unless the DV definition/coding differs from yours (or the covariates are centered/standardized differently or the constant is being reported differently in the paper).

**How to fix**
1. **Rebuild the analytic sample to match the paper**:
   - Use **the same survey year and the same inclusion criteria** Bryson used (the table is for “1993”; but your analytic N collapses to ~260, which signals you’re filtering much more than Bryson did).
   - Apply **the same listwise deletion rule** as the paper (likely: drop only cases missing any variable in the model; but your derived proxies may introduce additional missingness).
2. **Recreate the DVs exactly as Bryson did**:
   - Confirm the 6 “minority-linked” genres and the “remaining 12” are **exactly** the same items and coding (what counts as “dislike” and which response categories are included).
   - Check whether Bryson’s DV is a **sum**, **mean**, or **factor score**; your DV ranges (0–6 and 0–12) suggest sums, but the **Model 2 constant 7.860** is inconsistent with your DV distribution—this is a red flag that your DV construction does not match the paper’s.
3. **Do not standardize the dependent variable if you want the paper’s constant**:
   - Table 2 uses standardized coefficients for predictors, but constants come from the model as estimated. If you standardized DV (or used z-scored DV), constants will differ.
4. If you *can’t* reproduce N≈644/605, report that explicitly and stop claiming a replication.

### 2) Variable name / definition mismatches (and proxy problems)

#### 2.1 Racism variable label
**Mismatch**
- Generated: **“Racism score (0–5)”**
- True: **“Racism score”** (no range stated in Table 2)

**Fix**
- Use Bryson’s racism scale exactly (items, coding, and range). Don’t hard-code “0–5” unless verified from the codebook and matches the paper.

#### 2.2 Hispanic variable construction
**Mismatch**
- Generated: **“Hispanic (from ETHNIC; binary if possible, else heuristic fallback)”**
- True: **“Hispanic”** (a clean indicator)

**Fix**
- Do not use “heuristic fallback.” Construct Hispanic exactly per dataset documentation (often a dedicated Hispanic-origin variable). A “fallback” risks misclassification and changes coefficients and N.

#### 2.3 Conservative Protestant variable construction
**Mismatch**
- Generated: **“Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”**
- True: **“Conservative Protestant”**

**Fix**
- Bryson’s “Conservative Protestant” is typically a denominational family classification (e.g., Steensland/RELTRAD-type grouping), not a simplistic RELIG×DENOM condition. Use the correct classification scheme.

#### 2.4 “No religion” is missing in your models
**Mismatch**
- Generated: **No religion = NaN** in both models; and “Dropped_no_variation = no_religion”
- True: **No religion has coefficients**: **0.057 (M1)** and **0.024 (M2)**

**Fix**
- Your “no religion” dummy has no variation in your analytic sample (likely because your filtering removed almost everyone except a tiny subgroup, or because you coded it wrong).
- Recode:
  - Ensure “No religion” is a proper dummy with a real reference category.
  - Confirm RELIG categories and missing codes.
  - Don’t subset in a way that eliminates all “no religion” cases.

#### 2.5 Southern coding
**Mismatch**
- Generated: **Southern (REGION==3)**
- True: **Southern**

**Fix**
- Verify the region codes. In many surveys “South” is not necessarily “3.” If you used the wrong mapping, your coefficient will be wrong and possibly sign-flipped.

### 3) Coefficient mismatches (every variable)

Below I list **Generated vs True** for each model. Any difference is a mismatch; many are also sign errors.

#### Model 1 (Minority-linked genres)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | **0.1779** ** | **0.130** ** | Too large | Fix DV + sample + racism scale |
| Education | **-0.2679*** | **-0.175*** | Too negative | Fix sample; ensure education coding; standardize same way |
| Income pc | **-0.0083** | **-0.037** | Much closer to 0 | Fix income definition, missing handling, sample |
| Occ prestige | **+0.0666** | **-0.020** | **Sign flip** | Likely wrong prestige variable, wrong coding, or sample distortion |
| Female | **-0.0411** | **-0.057** | Smaller magnitude | Sample/standardization mismatch |
| Age | **0.1691** ** | **0.163*** | Similar size but wrong sig level | With correct N you likely get ***; your tiny N reduces power |
| Black | **-0.0894** | **-0.132*** | Too small in magnitude + wrong sig | Sample size/weights/coding mismatch |
| Hispanic | **-0.0590** | **-0.058** | Very close (good) | But ensure clean Hispanic indicator; still sample mismatch |
| Other race | **-0.0046** | **-0.017** | Too close to 0 | Sample/coding |
| Cons Prot | **0.0658** | **0.063** | Close | But your proxy may be coincidentally similar; use correct measure |
| No religion | **NaN** | **0.057** | Missing entirely | Fix dummy coding and restore variation |
| Southern | **-0.0575** | **0.024** | **Sign flip** | Region coding wrong and/or sample mismatch |
| Constant | **2.570*** | **2.415*** | Off | DV construction and/or centering differs |
| R² | **0.166** | **0.145** | Off | Sample/DV mismatch |
| N | **261** | **644** | Way off | Sample construction mismatch |

#### Model 2 (Remaining genres)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | **-0.0158** | **0.080** | **Sign flip** and magnitude | DV mismatch and/or racism scale mismatch |
| Education | **-0.1606*** (only *) | **-0.242*** | Too small and wrong sig | Sample size + DV mismatch |
| Income pc | **-0.0678** | **-0.065** | Close | Still, fix sample to confirm |
| Occ prestige | **-0.0861** | **0.005** | Wrong sign & large error | Prestige variable/coding mismatch |
| Female | **-0.0760** | **-0.070** | Close | But again sample mismatch |
| Age | **0.1144** | **0.126** ** | Slightly smaller | With correct sample you likely match ** |
| Black | **0.0099** | **0.042** | Too small | Race coding/sample mismatch |
| Hispanic | **0.0346** | **-0.029** | **Sign flip** | Hispanic coding problem (your “fallback” likely) |
| Other race | **0.0311** | **0.047** | Smaller | Sample mismatch |
| Cons Prot | **0.1485*** (*) | **0.048** | ~3× too large and wrong sig | Proxy coding very likely wrong |
| No religion | **NaN** | **0.024** | Missing | Fix dummy coding/variation |
| Southern | **0.1012** | **0.069** | Too large | Region coding/sample mismatch |
| Constant | **5.233*** | **7.860** | Very wrong | DV definition differs from paper (most likely) |
| R² | **0.137** | **0.147** | Off | Sample/DV mismatch |
| N | **259** | **605** | Way off | Sample mismatch |

### 4) “Standard errors” mismatch

**Mismatch**
- You were asked to check SEs, but:
  - Generated output includes **no SEs** (only standardized betas + stars).
  - True table **also has no SEs**.

So there is **no SE-to-SE comparison possible**, and any narrative implying SE replication would be incorrect.

**Fix**
- Don’t mention SEs or t-stats if you can’t compute/compare them to the paper.
- If you want SEs for your own models, compute and report them—but clearly label them as **not in Bryson’s Table 2**.

---

### 5) Interpretation/significance mismatches

**Mismatch**
- Several stars differ (e.g., **Age** M1 is ** in generated but *** in true; **Black** loses ***; **Education** in M2 loses ***).
- Some variables switch sign (Southern M1; Racism M2; Hispanic M2; Occ prestige both models).

**Fix**
- Stars depend on **N, exact coding, and weighting**. To match Bryson’s stars, you must match:
  1. the analytic N,
  2. the exact DV construction,
  3. exact variable coding (especially region, prestige, Hispanic, conservative Protestant),
  4. whether survey weights were used (many published OLS tables use weights; if you ignore them, coefficients/SEs can shift).

---

### 6) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match the paper

1. **Stop using proxies/fallbacks** for key demographics/religion.
   - Use canonical variables and coding for: Hispanic, race categories, region (South), religion categories, conservative Protestant classification.
2. **Reconstruct DVs to replicate Bryson’s exact items and “dislike” rule.**
   - Verify each genre item coding and which responses count as “dislike.”
   - Confirm whether Bryson summed binary “dislike” indicators or used something else.
   - Recheck: the Model 2 constant (7.860) strongly suggests your DV2 is not the same as Bryson’s DV2.
3. **Replicate Bryson’s sample definition to hit N≈644/605.**
   - Ensure you’re not inadvertently restricting to a subsample (e.g., only those with complete income/occ prestige, or only those with nonmissing on all 18 music items).
   - Handle missing values exactly as Bryson did (listwise deletion on the model vars only, unless otherwise stated).
4. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way.**
   - Standardize predictors (and possibly DV?) in the same manner as Bryson. Table says “standardized OLS coefficients,” which usually means **standardizing variables before OLS** or using post-estimation beta conversion. Use one method consistently.
5. **Verify region and prestige codings (likely sources of sign flips).**
   - Southern sign flip in M1 and prestige sign flips in both models are classic “wrong coding/wrong variable” symptoms.

If you share the exact code you used to (a) build the two DVs, (b) code Hispanic/conservative Protestant/South, and (c) filter to the analytic sample, I can point to the precise line(s) causing the N collapse and the sign reversals.
