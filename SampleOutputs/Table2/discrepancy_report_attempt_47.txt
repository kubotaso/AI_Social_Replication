============================================================

## 1) Model/sample size & fit statistics mismatches

### N (number of cases)
- **Mismatch**
  - **Generated:** Model 1 **N=261**, Model 2 **N=259**
  - **True (Bryson 1996 Table 2):** Model 1 **N=644**, Model 2 **N=605**
- **Likely cause**
  - You used a much smaller analytic sample (likely complete-case deletion across constructed DVs + covariates, and/or restricted to respondents with all 18 genre items; or you accidentally subset to a specific group/year/ID merge).
- **Fix**
  - Reproduce Bryson’s **sample construction** and missing-data handling:
    - Use the **same survey wave** and **same inclusion rules** as the paper.
    - Ensure the DV construction uses the same respondents/items and that missing items are handled the same way (often: allow partial completion and compute DV if enough genre items are present, or treat “don’t know” consistently).
    - Verify you are not inadvertently filtering (e.g., `dropna()` on too many columns at once).
  - After rebuilding, confirm Ns match **644** and **605**.

### R² and Adjusted R²
- **Mismatch**
  - **Generated:** Model 1 R²=0.179 (Adj=0.143); Model 2 R²=0.154 (Adj=0.116)
  - **True:** Model 1 R²=0.145 (Adj=0.129); Model 2 R²=0.147 (Adj=0.130)
- **Likely cause**
  - Different sample (biggest driver), possibly different DV construction/coding, and/or different set of predictors (see “No religion” below).
- **Fix**
  - Once sample + coding + predictors match Table 2, R² should move toward the published values.

### Constant (intercept)
- **Mismatch**
  - **Generated:** Model 1 constant **2.628***; Model 2 constant **5.270***  
  - **True:** Model 1 constant **2.415***; Model 2 constant **7.860** (note: printed without stars in your transcription)
- **Likely cause**
  - Different DV scaling or item count treatment, and different sample.
- **Fix**
  - Ensure DV is the **count** of “dislikes” across exactly the intended items with the same coding, and ensure you are using **unstandardized intercept** from an OLS on the raw DV (standardized betas do not standardize the DV unless you explicitly do so; Table 2 still reports an intercept on the raw DV scale).

---

## 2) Variable name / coding mismatches (including dropped variables)

### “No religion” is missing in generated models
- **Mismatch**
  - **Generated:** “No religion” is **NaN** and flagged `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion` (both models)
  - **True:** “No religion” is included:
    - Model 1: **0.057**
    - Model 2: **0.024**
- **Likely cause**
  - In your analytic sample, `no_religion` became constant (all 0 or all 1), usually because:
    - The sample was accidentally restricted to a subgroup where nobody has “no religion”, or
    - `no_religion` was miscomputed (e.g., NA recoded to 0), or
    - You filtered on a religion-related variable.
- **Fix**
  - Recompute `no_religion` from the original religion measure exactly as Bryson did.
  - Check frequency **before** listwise deletion and **after**:
    - If it becomes constant only after listwise deletion, your deletion is too aggressive (see sample size fix).
  - Do **not** drop it; ensure variation exists in the analytic sample.

### Region: “Southern” sign differs in Model 1
- **Mismatch**
  - **Generated Model 1:** Southern **-0.0508**
  - **True Model 1:** Southern **+0.024**
- **Likely cause**
  - Opposite coding (e.g., 1 = non-South vs 1 = South), or different reference categories if you used multiple region dummies, or sample differences.
- **Fix**
  - Verify coding: `southern = 1 if South, else 0` (as implied by the label).
  - If you coded `1 = non-South`, multiply coefficient by **-1** (or recode and rerun).
  - Confirm you’re not mixing “South” with “born in South” or “currently in South”.

### Race/ethnicity dummy set and reference
- **Generated** includes: `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` (implying White is reference), which matches the table structure.
- **But** several coefficients differ materially (see next section), consistent with either:
  - different sample,
  - different DV coding, and/or
  - different standardization method (see Section 4).

## 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas). Your generated tables are also labeled standardized betas, so these should match closely if the same data/coding/spec are used.

### Model 1 (Minority-linked genres: 6)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.139 | 0.130 | value slightly high; **sig differs** (see below) |
| Education | -0.260 | -0.175 | **too negative** (much larger magnitude) |
| Income pc | -0.015 | -0.037 | wrong magnitude |
| Occ prestige | +0.058 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.033 | -0.057 | magnitude off |
| Age | +0.174 | +0.163 | close-ish, but **sig differs** |
| Black | -0.176 | -0.132 | too negative; **sig differs** |
| Hispanic | -0.039 | -0.058 | magnitude off |
| Other race | +0.002 | -0.017 | wrong sign (small) |
| Cons Prot | +0.115 | +0.063 | too large |
| No religion | NaN | +0.057 | **missing** |
| Southern | -0.051 | +0.024 | **wrong sign** |

### Model 2 (Remaining 12 genres)
| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.014 | +0.080 | **wrong sign and magnitude** |
| Education | -0.165 | -0.242 | too small magnitude |
| Income pc | -0.081 | -0.065 | somewhat off |
| Occ prestige | -0.081 | +0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.082 | -0.070 | close-ish |
| Age | +0.123 | +0.126 | close |
| Black | +0.041 | +0.042 | essentially matches |
| Hispanic | -0.054 | -0.029 | too negative |
| Other race | +0.132 | +0.047 | too large |
| Cons Prot | +0.138 | +0.048 | too large |
| No religion | NaN | +0.024 | **missing** |
| Southern | +0.113 | +0.069 | too large |

**Key pattern:** multiple sign flips (occ prestige in both models; racism in Model 2; southern in Model 1). That is *not* just sampling noise—this screams **coding/specification mismatch**.

## 4) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation/reporting)

### Model 1 stars
- **Generated:** Racism `*`, Education `***`, Age `**`, Black `*`
- **True:** Racism `**`, Education `***`, Age `***`, Black `***`
- **Problem**
  - Your p-values/stars are inconsistent with the published stars, but more importantly **Table 2’s stars are based on the paper’s Ns and SEs** (not shown). With N=261 you will generally have *less* power, so you’d often see *fewer* stars—not the mixed pattern you have.
- **Fix**
  - Don’t try to match stars unless you match:
    1) the **exact sample**, and  
    2) the **exact model**, and  
    3) the **exact SE computation** (likely conventional OLS SEs; possibly weighted/design-adjusted if Bryson did so—Table 2 doesn’t clarify in your excerpt).
  - After matching Ns/spec/coding, compute p-values from the OLS t-tests and apply the same cutoffs (*, **, ***).

### Model 2 stars
- **Generated:** Education `*`, Other race `*`
- **True:** Education `***`, Age `**` (and Other race has no star)
- **Fix**
  - Same as above; additionally, your **racism sign is wrong** in Model 2, indicating the model isn’t the same.

---

## 5) “Standard errors” mismatch

- **Mismatch**
  - **Generated output:** does not show SEs, but your instruction asks to compare SEs.
  - **True:** explicitly says Table 2 **does not report SEs**.
- **Fix**
  - If the goal is to match Table 2, **do not invent or compare SEs** to the table.
  - If you want SEs anyway, compute and report them—but then you must state: “SEs not shown in Bryson (1996), so cannot be validated against Table 2.”

---

## 6) Most likely technical causes (and how to correct them)

### A) DV construction mismatch (very likely, given intercept + R² + coefficients)
- **Symptoms**
  - Different intercepts, different Ns, and broad coefficient differences.
- **Fix checklist**
  - Confirm each DV is exactly:
    - Model 1 DV: count of dislikes across **6 specified genres** (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin)
    - Model 2 DV: count of dislikes across the **other 12 genres**
  - Confirm what counts as “dislike” (e.g., bottom category only vs bottom two categories). If you coded “dislike” differently than Bryson, betas and intercepts will shift.

### B) Standardization method mismatch (possible contributor)
- **Symptoms**
  - Betas could differ if you standardized using a different SD (e.g., population vs sample SD), or standardized after listwise deletion vs before, or standardized including/excluding weights.
- **Fix**
  - Compute standardized betas the same way:
    - Either: standardize all X’s and Y within the analytic sample and run OLS, or
    - Use the formula \( \beta^* = b \cdot \frac{s_x}{s_y} \) using the same sample SDs.
  - If weights were used in Bryson, you need **weighted SDs** for standardization.

### C) Coding reversals / reference category problems (strongly indicated)
- **Occ prestige sign flip (both models)**
  - **Fix:** verify higher values mean **more** prestige (not less). If reversed, multiply by -1 or recode.
- **Southern sign flip (Model 1)**
  - **Fix:** ensure 1=South.
- **Racism score sign flip (Model 2)**
  - **Fix:** ensure higher racism score = more racist attitudes (not more tolerant). Also ensure you didn’t reverse-code only some items or compute the scale differently.
  - Also check whether Bryson used a different racism scale (item set/alpha) than you constructed.

### D) Dropping “No religion”
- **Fix:** stop it from being constant by fixing sample restriction and/or correct computation; then rerun including it.

---

## 7) Interpretation mismatches you should correct in the write-up

Even without your narrative text, the generated tables *invite* wrong interpretations:

- **Model 2 racism effect**
  - **Generated implies:** essentially zero or slightly negative racism–dislike link.
  - **True implies:** **positive** association (0.080), i.e., more racism → more dislike of remaining genres (though not significant in the table).
  - **Fix:** correct racism scale direction and/or DV construction to recover a positive coefficient.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - **Generated implies:** prestige increases dislike in Model 1 and decreases in Model 2 (negative).
  - **True:** near zero/slightly negative in Model 1 (-0.020) and near zero positive in Model 2 (+0.005).
  - **Fix:** correct prestige coding and sample/spec so the effect is near zero.

- **Southern (Model 1)**
  - **Generated implies:** Southerners dislike minority-linked genres *less* (negative).
  - **True:** Southerners dislike them *more* (positive 0.024, small).
  - **Fix:** correct the South dummy coding.

## What you need to provide to make this fully “every mismatch”
To identify *every* mismatch including the ones hidden in preprocessing (and to tell you exactly which line of code caused which discrepancy), I need:
1) your code for constructing both DVs and the racism scale,  
2) how you handled missing values,  
3) whether weights were used, and  
4) the exact regression specification (formula) used for both models.

Given what’s shown, the mismatches above are the complete set visible in **variable names, coefficients, fit stats, and interpretation direction**—and the concrete fixes are: **match sample (Ns), fix DV construction, fix coding direction for racism/prestige/south, and include “no religion” with variation**, then recompute standardized betas the same way Bryson did.
