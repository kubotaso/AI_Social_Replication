### 1) Variable-name mismatches (and missing/extra variables)

#### A. **Hispanic is missing in the generated models**
- **True Table 2 includes:** `Hispanic` in both models.
- **Generated results:** no `hispanic`/`Hispanic` term appears anywhere.
- **Fix:** add the Hispanic indicator to both regressions, using the same reference category as the paper (typically White as the omitted group).  
  - In code: ensure the race dummy set includes `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` (and *not* inadvertently drop one due to collinearity rules).

#### B. **“no_religion” is present but dropped (NaN)**
- **True Table 2 includes:** `No religion` with nonzero coefficients in both models (Model 1: 0.057; Model 2: 0.024).
- **Generated:** `no_religion` is listed as `NaN` and flagged as `dropped_zero_variance`.
- **Fix:** this indicates a data/prep problem, not a statistical one. Common causes:
  1. Variable coded as a constant (all 0/1) after filtering/subsetting.
  2. Recoding mistake (e.g., `no_religion = (religion != "none")` instead of `==`).
  3. All cases with `no_religion==1` were dropped due to missingness on other covariates.
  - Diagnostics: print `value_counts()` (or tabulation) of `no_religion` **after** the final analytic sample restriction for each model.
  - Repair: correct the recode; or change missing-data handling (e.g., consistent listwise deletion across variables as in the paper); or ensure you’re using 1993 GSS cases comparable to Bryson.

#### C. **Potential naming mismatch: “education_years” vs “Education”; “age_years” vs “Age”**
- These are likely just internal names, not substantive mismatches **as long as** they are the same constructs.
- **But** if the paper used *education (years)* and you used something else (degree categories, or standardized years), coefficients won’t match.
- **Fix:** verify measurement matches the GSS 1993 “EDUC” (years) and “AGE”.

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I compare the **paper’s standardized coefficients** to the **generated “paper_style” betas** (since Table 2 is standardized).

#### Model 1 (paper) vs Generated ModelA_paper_style

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.156*** | **Too large**, sig differs |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.285*** | **Too negative** (much larger magnitude) |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.036 | close (OK) |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.068 | **Wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.010 | too small (near 0) |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.119** | too small; sig differs |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.148** | magnitude close; **sig too weak** |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | **missing** | **omitted variable** |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.025 | **Wrong sign** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.063 | 0.085 | somewhat larger; sig differs (paper: none) |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN | **dropped** |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.024 | matches well |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.692*** | **different** (see notes below) |

#### Model 2 (paper) vs Generated ModelB_paper_style

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | 0.034 | too small |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.268*** | somewhat too negative |
| HH income pc | -0.065 | -0.055 | close-ish |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.007 | small, sign differs (minor) |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.075 | close (OK) |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.024 | **far too small** |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.101* | **too large**, significance shouldn’t be present |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **missing** | omitted |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.083 | too large |
| Cons Protestant | 0.048 | 0.101* | too large; sig mismatch |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN | dropped |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.154*** | **much too large** |
| Constant | 7.860 | 6.039*** | different |

**Core causes to check/fix for coefficient differences**
1. **Wrong sample year / wrong subset**: Bryson Table 2 is **GSS 1993**. Your N’s (491, 485) are much smaller than the true N’s (644, 605), strongly suggesting additional restrictions, missing-data loss, or wrong dataset year pooling.
2. **DV construction mismatch**: The dependent variables are *counts of genres disliked* in very specific sets. If your genre grouping or the definition of “dislike” differs even slightly, coefficients will shift.
3. **Different coding of race/region/religion**: Especially: `south` and race dummies, and the “conservative Protestant” classification.
4. **Standardization method mismatch**: Table 2 reports standardized coefficients; you appear to compute betas from unstandardized b’s. That’s fine only if you standardize predictors and outcome the same way as the paper (typically z-scoring on the analytic sample). If you standardized using population SDs, weighted SDs, or a different sample, betas won’t match.

### 3) Standard error mismatches (cannot be validated against Table 2)

- **True-results note is correct:** Table 2 **does not provide standard errors**.
- **Generated “full” models include std_err/t/p**. That’s not “wrong” statistically, but it **cannot be presented as matching Table 2**.
- **Fix (presentation):**
  - For “paper match,” report **only standardized betas + stars** using the same p-value cutoffs.
  - If you want SEs, you must compute them from your fitted model, but you must label them as *computed SEs from replication data*, not “from Table 2.”

---

### 4) Significance-marker mismatches

Even where betas are in the ballpark, stars often differ:

#### Examples
- **Model 1 Age:** paper 0.163*** vs generated 0.119**  
- **Model 1 Black:** paper -0.132*** vs generated -0.148**  
- **Model 2 Black:** paper 0.042 (none) vs generated 0.101*  
- **Model 2 South:** paper 0.069 (none) vs generated 0.154***

**Fix:** stars depend on **p-values**, which depend on:
- sample size (your N is much smaller),
- model specification (you’re missing Hispanic and no_religion),
- possibly weights/design correction (GSS often uses weights; paper may or may not),
- and DV construction.

To align stars, first align: **sample**, **variables**, **coding**, **DV**, then recompute.

### 5) Fit-statistics mismatches (N, R², adjusted R²)

#### Model 1
- **True:** N=644; R²=.145; Adj R²=.129
- **Generated:** N=491; R²=.183; Adj R²=.166

#### Model 2
- **True:** N=605; R²=.147; Adj R²=.130
- **Generated:** N=485; R²=.176; Adj R²=.159

**Fix:**
1. Recreate the exact analytic sample used in the paper:
   - 1993 only
   - same age restrictions (if any)
   - same handling of missing data (typically listwise deletion on all model variables)
2. Reconstruct the DVs exactly (genre sets and dislike definition).
3. Include **all** covariates from the table (including Hispanic and No religion).
4. If the paper used weights, apply the correct GSS weight and note that R² behavior may differ under weighted estimation depending on software definition.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatches / misleading claims

#### A. Claiming “standard errors” from Table 2
- The true-results note says SEs aren’t in the table; generated output includes SEs. If your narrative implied these SEs were “from Bryson (1996) Table 2,” that’s a mismatch.
- **Fix:** clearly separate:
  - “Paper-reported standardized coefficients”
  - vs “replication-model SEs computed from our re-estimation”

#### B. Constants are not directly comparable if standardization differs
- Table reports “standardized OLS coefficients” but still includes a constant. Depending on how the table was constructed, the constant may come from an unstandardized DV model (or a standardized-X-only model). Your constants differ a lot (e.g., 2.415 vs 2.692; 7.860 vs 6.039).
- **Fix:** verify how you generated “standardized coefficients.” The safest way to reproduce Table 2 is:
  - Fit the model on the original scale,
  - Compute standardized betas post-hoc for slopes only,
  - Report the **unstandardized intercept** from that same model (if the paper did that), OR omit the intercept from the “standardized coefficients” table if inconsistent.

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the paper

1. **Add missing covariate:** include `Hispanic` dummy in both models.
2. **Fix `no_religion` so it varies:** correct coding and ensure it survives listwise deletion.
3. **Rebuild the dependent variables** to match the two genre groups exactly and the paper’s “dislike” definition.
4. **Match the analytic sample (biggest issue):**
   - use **GSS 1993**
   - match inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - apply the same missing-data rule
   - consider weights if Bryson used them (check paper methods/notes).
5. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way:**
   - standardize using the **final analytic sample** for each model (after deletion),
   - verify whether you standardized Y as well or only X (this affects interpretation of intercept and potentially reported numbers if you’re not careful).
6. **Do not present SEs as table-extracted.** If you report SEs, label them as re-estimated.

If you want, paste (a) your exact DV construction code and (b) how you coded race/religion and filtered the sample; I can pinpoint which step is causing the biggest deviations (the N drop + no_religion zero-variance strongly suggests a preprocessing/filtering error).
