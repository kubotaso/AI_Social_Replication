Score: 23/100
============================================================

### 1) Standard errors: generated output implies SEs/extra columns that do not exist in the true table
**Mismatch**
- The generated tables include columns like `constant_b` (mostly `NaN`) and an implied structure consistent with coefficient/SE output.
- The **true Table 2 reports no standard errors at all**—only standardized coefficients and significance markers.

**How to fix**
- Remove any SE-related fields entirely (or set SEs explicitly to “not reported” rather than fabricating/inferring them).
- Structure the output as: variable name → standardized beta → significance stars (no SE column).

---

### 2) Variable names are missing/misaligned in the generated tables (no labels)
**Mismatch**
- The generated tables list only coefficient rows with blank lines and no variable names.
- The true results have 12 named predictors + constant in each model.

**How to fix**
- Add a variable-name column and ensure row order matches the paper exactly:
  1. Racism score  
  2. Education  
  3. Household income per capita  
  4. Occupational prestige  
  5. Female  
  6. Age  
  7. Black  
  8. Hispanic  
  9. Other race  
  10. Conservative Protestant  
  11. No religion  
  12. Southern  
  + Constant

Also delete the blank spacer rows currently appearing in the generated table.

### 3) Coefficients + stars: Model 1 (paper) vs Generated ModelA
Assuming the generated ModelA rows correspond to the paper’s Model 1 in the listed order (they appear to match roughly), the mismatches are:

| Variable | True (Model 1) | Generated (ModelA) | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.139* | star level wrong (** vs *); coef slightly off | set to ** and value to 0.130 |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.261*** | coefficient wrong (too negative) | replace with -0.175*** |
| HH income pc | -0.037 | -0.034 | close (rounding diff) | use -0.037 (or match rounding convention) |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.030 | sign wrong | set to -0.020 |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.026 | magnitude wrong | set to -0.057 |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.191*** | coefficient wrong | set to 0.163*** |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.127* | star level wrong (*** vs *); coef slightly off | set to -0.132*** |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | 0.004 | sign wrong and magnitude wrong | set to -0.058 |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.079 | sign wrong | set to -0.017 |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.063 | 0.022 | magnitude wrong | set to 0.063 |
| No religion | 0.057 | (missing/blank row) | omitted | add 0.057 |
| Southern | 0.024 | 2.654*** (looks like constant placed here) | row alignment broken; constant misplaced | move constant to “Constant” row; set Southern=0.024 |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.654*** | wrong constant | set to 2.415*** |

**Key diagnosis:** after the 7th row, the generated table’s blank spacer rows likely caused **row shifting**, so later coefficients do not map to the right variables.

---

### 4) Coefficients + stars: Model 2 (paper) vs Generated ModelB
Again assuming the intended order is the paper’s order:

| Variable | True (Model 2) | Generated (ModelB) | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.005 | sign wrong | set to 0.080 (no stars) |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.224*** | coef wrong | set to -0.242*** |
| HH income pc | -0.065 | -0.095 | coef wrong | set to -0.065 |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.012 | sign wrong | set to 0.005 |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.091 | coef wrong | set to -0.070 |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.091 | coef wrong and missing ** | set to 0.126** |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.112 | coef wrong | set to 0.042 |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | (missing; next shown 0.132*) | misaligned | set to -0.029 |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.132* | wrong value/stars | set to 0.047 |
| Cons. Protestant | 0.048 | 0.080 | coef wrong | set to 0.048 |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.142** | wrong value/stars | set to 0.024 |
| Southern | 0.069 | (missing/blank) | omitted | add 0.069 |
| Constant | 7.860 (no stars shown in paper table) | 5.674*** | wrong constant; wrong stars | set to 7.860 (and match paper’s star display—none shown) |

**Same structural problem:** missing variable labels + blank rows likely caused **mis-mapping** of coefficients to variables, plus multiple coefficients are simply not the paper’s values.

---

### 5) Model fit statistics (N, R², Adj R²) are wrong in both models
**Mismatch**
- Generated ModelA_fit: **n=327**, R²=0.1896, adj R²=0.1639  
  True Model 1: **N=644**, R²=.145, adj R²=.129
- Generated ModelB_fit: **n=308**, R²=0.1658, adj R²=0.1377  
  True Model 2: **N=605**, R²=.147, adj R²=.130

**How to fix**
- Use the correct sample sizes (644 and 605).
- Replace R² and adjusted R² with the paper’s values.
- If you are re-estimating models from data (instead of copying Table 2), ensure you are using:
  - the **1993 GSS** sample consistent with Bryson (1996),
  - the same missing-data handling/listwise deletion rules the author used,
  - identical variable construction (especially the DVs: “dislike minority genres” vs “dislike remaining 12”),
  - and the same weighting (if any).  
  Otherwise your Ns and fit stats will not match.

---

### 6) Interpretation/significance mismatches (stars)
**Mismatch**
- Several star levels do not match the paper even when the coefficient is close (e.g., Racism in Model 1 should be ** not *, Black in Model 1 should be *** not *).
- Generated output also assigns *** to the constants; the paper shows constant starred in Model 1 but Model 2’s constant is shown without stars in your transcription.

**How to fix**
- Do **not recompute p-values/stars** from absent SEs. Instead, **copy the significance markers exactly** as displayed in Table 2.
- Apply the paper’s two-tailed thresholds: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001.

## Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 2
1. **Rebuild both tables with explicit variable names** and no blank spacer rows.
2. **Drop SE fields entirely** (or mark SE as “not reported in Table 2”).
3. **Hard-set** coefficients and stars to the paper’s Table 2 values (since Table 2 is what you’re trying to reproduce).
4. **Correct model fit block** to N/R²/Adj R² exactly as in the paper.
5. If instead the goal is replication from microdata: document and align **sample definition, DV construction, and missing-data rules** until N and coefficients match; otherwise do not label it as “Table 2 Bryson (1996)” output.
