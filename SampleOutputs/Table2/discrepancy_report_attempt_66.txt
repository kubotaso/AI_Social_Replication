Score: 22/100
============================================================

### A. Global discrepancies (apply to both models)

1) **Sample size (N) is wrong**
- **Generated:** Model A N=281; Model B N=279  
- **True (paper):** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605  
**Fix:** Use the correct GSS 1993 analytic samples and the paper’s missing-data handling. Your N is less than half, strongly suggesting you:
  - used the wrong year(s),
  - filtered to a subset,
  - or did listwise deletion on additional variables not in Table 2 (or different codings that create extra missingness).
  
2) **R² and Adjusted R² do not match**
- **Generated:**  
  - Model A R²=.1557; Adj R²=.1212  
  - Model B R²=.1605; Adj R²=.1260  
- **True:**  
  - Model 1 R²=.145; Adj R²=.129  
  - Model 2 R²=.147; Adj R²=.130  
**Fix:** Once N and variable coding match the paper, refit. Also ensure you are computing **standardized OLS coefficients** (as in the paper) but **R² should be from the same unweighted/weighted specification** used by Bryson. If you used weights (or didn’t), align to the paper’s approach.

3) **Standard errors are being implied but cannot be validated**
- The paper’s Table 2 **does not report SEs**. Your output doesn’t show SEs explicitly, but your request mentions them; if your “generated analysis” includes SEs elsewhere, they **cannot be “matched” to Table 2**.
**Fix:** Remove any claims about matching SEs to Table 2. If you must report SEs, compute them from the microdata—but label them as *your* estimates, not “from Table 2”.

4) **Constant is mishandled (NaN in std_coef)**
- **Generated:** constant has `std_coef = NaN` but has a starred `std_coef_star` (e.g., 2.758***, 6.429***)
- **True:** constants are **2.415*** (Model 1) and **7.860** (Model 2; no stars shown in what you pasted)
**Fix:** Don’t “standardize” the intercept (it’s not meaningful). Report the intercept as the unstandardized constant (as the paper does) and ensure it matches once the model/specification matches.

5) **“No religion” is missing entirely**
- **Generated:** “No religion” = NaN in both models (coefficient absent)
- **True:** “No religion” is included (0.057 in Model 1; 0.024 in Model 2)
**Fix:** Include the “No religion” dummy exactly as in the paper and ensure you have a proper reference category for religion (and that you didn’t accidentally drop the column due to collinearity or missingness).

6) **DV naming suggests you’re not using the same constructed dependent variables**
- **Generated DV names:** `dislike_minority_genres`, `dislike_other12_genres`
- **True DVs:** (1) *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin*; (2) *Dislike of the 12 remaining genres*.
**Fix:** Reconstruct both DVs exactly:
  - Confirm the **exact set of genres** in each DV and that you’re counting “disliked” the same way Bryson did.
  - Ensure scale is “number of genres disliked” and coded identically.

### B. Model-by-model coefficient/significance mismatches

## Model 1 (paper) vs Generated ModelA_table

Below are **every coefficient/significance mismatch**.

| Variable | Generated (ModelA) | True (Model 1) | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | +0.118 (no sig) | +0.130** | coef too low; missing ** | correct DV/sample/coding; verify racism scale construction |
| Education | -0.254*** | -0.175*** | coef too negative | education coding or standardization differs; match Bryson’s measure and standardization |
| Income per capita | +0.009 | -0.037 | wrong sign | income definition likely wrong (not per-capita, wrong transform, or miscoded) |
| Occ prestige | +0.055 | -0.020 | wrong sign | prestige measure likely different (e.g., wrong occupational scale) |
| Female | +0.001 | -0.057 | wrong sign and near zero | gender coding likely inverted/incorrect or sample issue |
| Age | +0.078 | +0.163*** | too small; missing *** | age scaling/standardization mismatch and/or wrong sample |
| Black | -0.174** | -0.132*** | magnitude differs; sig level differs (** vs ***) | race coding and/or weights/sample differences |
| Hispanic | +0.188** | -0.058 | wrong sign and huge magnitude | major mismatch: DV construction likely wrong (Hispanic should dislike *minority-liked* genres less, not more) |
| Other race | -0.006 | -0.017 | magnitude off (sign same) | minor, but still mismatch—likely same root causes (sample/coding) |
| Cons Protestant | +0.064 | +0.063 | close (OK) | this is the only one essentially matching |
| No religion | NaN | +0.057 | missing | include variable correctly |
| Southern | -0.004 | +0.024 | wrong sign | region coding mismatch |
| Constant | 2.758*** | 2.415*** | wrong value | once model/spec matches, intercept should move; also don’t standardize intercept |

**Interpretation error implied by Hispanic coefficient:** In the true table, Hispanic is **negative** for Model 1, meaning Hispanics dislike those “minority-liked” genres *less* (net of controls). Your generated result says the opposite.

---

## Model 2 (paper) vs Generated ModelB_table

| Variable | Generated (ModelB) | True (Model 2) | What’s wrong | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | -0.007 | +0.080 | wrong sign and much smaller | wrong DV construction and/or racism scale or sample |
| Education | -0.257*** | -0.242*** | close-ish but still off | align coding/standardization/sample |
| Income per capita | -0.040 | -0.065 | magnitude off | income coding/transform mismatch |
| Occ prestige | -0.086 | +0.005 | wrong sign | wrong prestige measure or coding |
| Female | -0.054 | -0.070 | somewhat close | likely improves with correct sample/coding |
| Age | +0.013 | +0.126** | far too small; missing ** | age coding/standardization/sample mismatch |
| Black | +0.011 | +0.042 | too small | sample/coding mismatch |
| Hispanic | +0.116* | -0.029 | wrong sign | again suggests DV construction differs from Bryson |
| Other race | +0.059 | +0.047 | fairly close | minor mismatch |
| Cons Protestant | +0.170** | +0.048 | massively too large | religion coding/reference category mismatch, or you used different “conservative Protestant” definition |
| No religion | NaN | +0.024 | missing | include variable correctly |
| Southern | +0.110 | +0.069 | too large | region coding/weights/sample mismatch |
| Constant | 6.429*** | 7.860 | wrong value and likely wrong significance | match model spec; also confirm whether constant is significant in your computation vs paper reporting |

### C. Why these mismatches are happening (most likely)

Given the *pattern*—especially:
- wrong signs for **Hispanic** in both models,
- wrong sign for **income** in Model 1,
- wrong sign for **prestige** in both models,
- **age** effects drastically attenuated,
- Ns far smaller,

…this is not a minor rounding/standardization issue. It strongly indicates you are **not reproducing Bryson’s exact variable construction and analytic sample**.

Most probable causes:
1) **Dependent variables not constructed exactly as counts of “disliked” genres** from the exact genre lists.
2) **Different coding of “dislike”** (e.g., treating “like” as dislike, or using a different threshold).
3) **Different variable definitions**: income per capita, prestige scale, conservative Protestant definition, region definition.
4) **Different sample restrictions / missing data handling** (leading to N≈280 instead of 600+).
5) **Standardization procedure differs** (e.g., standardizing within a subset, or standardizing after listwise deletion vs before; but this alone wouldn’t flip signs systematically).

### D. Concrete steps to fix so the generated analysis matches the paper

1) **Recreate the exact two DVs**
- Model 1 DV must be: count of dislikes among **Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin**.
- Model 2 DV must be: count of dislikes among the **other 12** genres in the module.
- Verify the raw response categories and how Bryson defines “dislike” (binary indicator per genre, then summed).

2) **Use GSS 1993 and match Bryson’s sample**
- Restrict to respondents with valid answers for the music items used in each DV and the covariates in Table 2.
- Do not introduce extra exclusions (e.g., dropping for missing on variables not in Table 2).

3) **Match independent variable coding**
- **Racism score:** must be the same composite and direction as Bryson’s (higher = more racist).
- **Education:** years (not categories), as in table.
- **Household income per capita:** confirm construction (household income divided by household size, plus any transformations).
- **Occupational prestige:** ensure you’re using the same prestige scale available in GSS at the time (not a different occupational status index).
- **Race/ethnicity dummies:** Black, Hispanic, Other race with the same reference (White non-Hispanic).
- **Religion dummies:** include both Conservative Protestant and No religion with correct reference group (other religions).
- **Southern:** correct census region dummy.

4) **Compute standardized coefficients the way the table reports them**
- Table reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas). Do: standardize Xs and Y (or use a beta conversion), but keep interpretation consistent.
- Do **not** standardize the intercept; report it unstandardized.

5) **Significance stars**
- Apply the paper’s thresholds: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001 (two-tailed).
- Once coefficients align, the stars should align too (minor differences can occur if you are not using identical weights/SE method—but with correct replication they should be very close).

6) **Remove “SE matching” claims**
- Since SEs are not in Table 2, don’t claim your SEs “match Table 2.” If you compute SEs, present them as additional results from your replication.

If you want, paste (a) your exact genre lists and how you coded “dislike,” (b) how you built the racism score, income per capita, and “conservative Protestant,” and (c) your filtering/missing-data rules. With that, I can pinpoint which specific construction is causing the sign flips (especially for Hispanic and prestige).
