============================================================

Below is an item-by-item audit of **every mismatch** between the *Generated Results* and Bryson (1996) Table 2 (*True Results*), plus what to change so your generated analysis reproduces the published table.

---

## 1) Big structural mismatches (these guarantee coefficient differences)

### 1.1 Sample size (N) is wrong in both models
- **True**: Model 1 **N=644**, Model 2 **N=605**
- **Generated**: Model A **N=320**, Model B **N=311**

**Why it matters:** Different N implies different inclusion/exclusion rules (missing data handling, constructed variables, weights, etc.), so coefficients/R² won’t match.

**How to fix**
1. Recreate the paper’s **exact analytic sample definition**:
   - Use the same survey year (1993 GSS module in Bryson).
   - Apply the same restrictions Bryson applied (often: nonmissing on DV + key IVs; sometimes listwise deletion across all regressors).
2. Ensure your **constructed religion variables (Conservative Protestant, No religion)** do *not* create massive missingness (see §3.2). Your current construction likely drops many cases because it “requires nonmissing RELIG & DENOM”.

---

### 1.2 R² / Adjusted R² do not match
- **True**:  
  - Model 1: R² **0.145**, Adj R² **0.129**  
  - Model 2: R² **0.147**, Adj R² **0.130**
- **Generated**:  
  - Model A: R² **0.196**, Adj R² **0.168**  
  - Model B: R² **0.150**, Adj R² **0.119**

**Why it matters:** Even if coefficients were “close,” these fit stats show the model/data are not the same.

**How to fix**
- Fix N and variable coding first; then recompute standardized OLS coefficients on the matched analytic sample.
- Also verify you are not accidentally running a model on a *subsample* (e.g., only those with DENOM observed).

---

### 1.3 Constant (intercept) differs—especially Model 2
- **True**:
  - Model 1 constant **2.415***  
  - Model 2 constant **7.860** (no stars shown in provided “true results”; in the paper it’s typically reported but may not be starred)
- **Generated**:
  - Model A constant **2.513*** (close-ish but still off)
  - Model B constant **5.613*** (very far off)

**Why it matters:** For count-like DVs, the intercept is strongly driven by DV construction and sample composition.

**How to fix**
- Make sure the **DV is constructed exactly like Bryson’s** (what counts as “dislike,” which genres included, how missing/“don’t know” handled).
- Then fix sample selection.

---

## 2) Variable-by-variable coefficient and “significance star” mismatches

> Note: Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients only** (no SEs). Your generated output reports betas and stars; that’s comparable *only if* the stars come from the same p-value computation and same data/model.

### Model 1 / Generated “Model A” vs True “Model 1”

| Variable | True coef (stars) | Generated beta (stars) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130\*\*** | **0.144\*** | coef too high; **significance level wrong** (** vs *) |
| Education | **-0.175\*\*\*** | **-0.270\*\*\*** | much more negative than true |
| Household income pc | -0.037 | -0.0258 | magnitude off |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | +0.0821 | **sign wrong** and magnitude wrong |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.0281 | magnitude off |
| Age | **0.163\*\*\*** | **0.1728\*\*** | star level wrong (**\*\*\*** vs **), coef slightly off |
| Black | **-0.132\*\*\*** | **-0.1565\*** | star level wrong (*** vs *), magnitude off |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.0713 | modest mismatch |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.00335 | modest mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 (ns) | **0.1293\*** | **too large; significance wrong** |
| No religion | 0.057 (ns) | **NaN (dropped)** | **variable missing entirely** |
| Southern | 0.024 (ns) | -0.0333 | **sign wrong** |

**How to fix Model 1 mismatches**
- **Occupational prestige**: you likely used a different prestige variable (or different coding/standardization). Bryson’s table says “Occupational prestige” with a small negative (-0.020). You used **PRESTG80** and got +0.082.  
  - Fix: verify Bryson’s exact prestige measure (variable name, coding, who is assigned prestige—respondent vs household head, handling of nonworkers). Use the same transformation and missing rules.
- **Southern**: sign flips (true +0.024 vs generated -0.033). This often happens if REGION coding differs or reference category differs.  
  - Fix: confirm **REGION==3** really corresponds to “South” in that dataset/year and that you didn’t invert/shift region codes.
- **Conservative Protestant**: your proxy is likely not Bryson’s definition; it’s inflating the effect and changing N.  
  - Fix: use the paper’s exact religious tradition coding (often based on RELIG + DENOM with a full classification scheme, not a narrow {1,6} set). Also avoid requiring DENOM for everyone if Bryson didn’t.
- **Racism/Black/Age significance stars**: your p-values differ because N/model differ (and possibly because you’re using heteroskedastic-robust SEs or something else).  
  - Fix: replicate **OLS + same weights (if any) + same listwise deletion + same variance estimator** used in the paper (almost certainly conventional OLS SEs, two-tailed tests).

### Model 2 / Generated “Model B” vs True “Model 2”

| Variable | True coef (stars) | Generated beta (stars) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 (ns) | 0.0284 (ns) | too small |
| Education | **-0.242\*\*\*** | **-0.2276\*\*\*** | close-ish (still off) |
| Household income pc | -0.065 | -0.0397 | too small |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.00309 | sign slightly off (tiny) |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.0803 | close-ish |
| Age | **0.126\*\*** | 0.0526 (ns) | **far too small; significance missing** |
| Black | 0.042 (ns) | 0.1151 (ns) | too large |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.0660 | too negative |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.0800 | too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 (ns) | **0.1267\*** | **too large; significance wrong** |
| No religion | 0.024 (ns) | **NaN (dropped)** | **variable missing entirely** |
| Southern | 0.069 (ns) | 0.0986 (ns) | somewhat higher but same sign |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.613*** | large mismatch |

**How to fix Model 2 mismatches**
- **Age** is the biggest substantive mismatch: true is 0.126** but you get 0.053 (ns). That screams “different sample and/or different DV construction.”
  - Fix DV coding first (see §3.1), then sample.
- **Conservative Protestant** again: too large and significant in your run, but not in Bryson.
  - Fix religious tradition definition and missingness rules.
- **Constant** huge mismatch: likely DV construction is wrong (threshold for “dislike”, genre set, handling of missing responses).
  - Fix DV definition exactly.

---

## 3) Variable name / inclusion mismatches

### 3.1 DV construction likely does not match Bryson
You label DVs as “count of dislikes (out of 6)” and “count of dislikes (out of 12).” That’s plausible, but your **Model B intercept** and your **DV means** suggest you are not reproducing the same coding.

- **Generated DV descriptives (analytic samples)**:
  - Model A mean = **2.00** (N=320)
  - Model B mean = **3.79** (N=311)
- **True table constants** imply (combined with typical covariate means) that Model 2 DV level is much higher (constant 7.860) than your 5.613.

**How to fix**
- Rebuild the “dislike” indicator exactly:
  - Which response categories count as “dislike” (e.g., “dislike” + “strongly dislike” vs only “strongly dislike”)?
  - How are “don’t know,” “never heard,” refusals treated—missing or “not dislike”?
  - Are genre items all asked of all respondents? If not, Bryson may have rules to treat non-asked items as missing and then require a minimum answered, etc.
- Ensure the genre sets are exactly Bryson’s:
  - Model 1: Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin
  - Model 2: the other 12 (must match Bryson’s list)

---

### 3.2 “No religion” incorrectly dropped (should be included)
- **True**: “No religion” is in both models with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**
- **Generated**: `No religion (RELIG==4)` is **NaN** and explicitly “dropped (no variation)”

This is not a “small discrepancy”—it indicates your analytic sample has **no cases** with RELIG==4, which is almost certainly caused by your construction and missing-data filtering (or mis-coded RELIG categories).

**How to fix**
1. Verify RELIG coding in the 1993 file you are using:
   - RELIG==4 might not be “no religion” in your extract (coding differs across files/years).
2. Don’t create a religion variable that forces listwise deletion on DENOM:
   - Your Conservative Protestant definition “requires nonmissing RELIG & DENOM,” which can drop many respondents and could remove all “no religion” if DENOM is missing for them (often DENOM not asked of “no religion”).
3. Correct approach:
   - Code `no_religion = 1` if respondent reports no religion.
   - Code `cons_prot = 1` for conservative Protestants among those with religion info.
   - Use an appropriate reference group (e.g., mainline/other) and keep `no_religion` in the model even if DENOM missing is structurally tied to no religion.

---

### 3.3 Southern variable coding may not match
- **True**: Southern = **+0.024** (Model1), **+0.069** (Model2)
- **Generated**: Southern = **-0.033** (ModelA), **+0.099** (ModelB)

Model 1 sign flip suggests miscoding.

**How to fix**
- Confirm region codes for that dataset/year.
- Or use a dedicated “South” dummy variable from the dataset if available (instead of REGION==3).

---

### 3.4 Race/ethnicity construction differs from Bryson
Your Hispanic variable is described as:

> “derived from ETHNIC; nonresponse mostly missing; forced 0 for Black”

That is not how published tables are usually constructed unless explicitly stated. Bryson’s “Hispanic” is almost certainly a standard Hispanic identifier independent of race, or a mutually exclusive race/ethnicity scheme described in the paper.

**How to fix**
- Reproduce Bryson’s exact race/ethnicity coding scheme:
  - Are categories mutually exclusive (White / Black / Hispanic / Other)?
  - Or are Hispanic and Black separate indicators?
- Do **not** “force 0 for Black” unless the paper defines it that way.

---

## 4) Standard errors: required mismatch note
You were asked to “identify every mismatch in … standard errors,” but:

- **True results**: *no standard errors reported* (explicitly stated).
- **Generated results**: also do not report SEs—only standardized betas + stars.

So there is no SE-to-SE comparison possible. The discrepancy is instead:

**Mismatch:** Your generated output implies inferential testing (stars) but the paper’s table only gives stars tied to its own p-values; without matching N/specification, your stars will not align.

**How to fix**
- Use the same test basis as Bryson:
  - Conventional OLS SEs (unless paper says otherwise)
  - Same weighting and design handling (GSS weights? typically WTSSALL or a year-specific weight)
  - Same two-tailed thresholds

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches embedded in the generated labels
Even where the numeric differences are “small,” several *labels* bake in assumptions not in the table:

- “Racism score (0–5; 5 dichotomies, require >=4 answered, prorated)”  
  Bryson’s table just says “Racism score.” If your scale construction differs even slightly, coefficients will drift.

**How to fix**
- Recreate Bryson’s racism scale exactly from the paper’s methods:
  - Which items, dichotomization rules, prorating rule, minimum answered rule.
- Then confirm the scale range and distribution match what Bryson implies.

---

## 6) Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Rebuild both DVs** exactly (genre list + what counts as “dislike” + missing rules).
2. **Rebuild racism scale** exactly as Bryson defines it.
3. **Recode religion** so:
   - Conservative Protestant matches Bryson’s classification (not a narrow proxy)
   - “No religion” is retained and varies
   - DENOM missingness doesn’t delete “no religion” respondents
4. **Recode South** correctly for the year/file.
5. **Match sample sizes** (target N=644 and N=605) via the same listwise deletion rules.
6. **Use standardized OLS coefficients** (beta weights) and the same p-value computation for stars.
7. Recompute R², Adj R², constants; they should move toward **0.145/0.129** and **0.147/0.130**, and constants **2.415** and **7.860**.

If you share (a) the exact code you used to construct the DVs and key IVs and (b) which dataset/weighting you used, I can point to the specific line(s) causing the N collapse and the “no religion” drop, which are currently the two biggest sources of mismatch.
