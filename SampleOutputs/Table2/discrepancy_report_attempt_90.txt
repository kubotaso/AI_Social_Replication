Score: 45/100
============================================================

Below is a line-by-line audit of **every mismatch** between your *Generated Results* and the *True Results (Bryson 1996 Table 2)*, plus what to change so the generated analysis matches the paper.

---

## 1) Sample size (N): wrong in both models

### Mismatch
- **True Model 1 N = 644**, but Generated Model 1 has **N = 438**
- **True Model 2 N = 605**, but Generated Model 2 has **N = 406**

### Why this is a serious discrepancy
N differences of this magnitude guarantee different coefficients, R², p-values, and intercepts. This is not a rounding issue; it indicates you are analyzing a different dataset, using extra listwise deletion, different weights, different variable coding, or a restricted subsample.

### Fix
To match Bryson:
- Use the **same dataset/wave** and **same inclusion criteria** as the paper.
- Reproduce Bryson’s **missing-data handling** (likely not listwise deletion on the full covariate set, or a different constructed sample).
- Apply any **survey weights** if the paper used them (Table 2 often uses weighted data in GSS-style analyses).
- Ensure the DV construction yields the same number of non-missing cases as in the table.

---

## 2) R² and Adjusted R²: wrong in both models

### Mismatch
**Model 1**
- True: **R² = 0.145**, **Adj R² = 0.129**
- Generated: **R² = 0.12645**, **Adj R² = 0.101785**

**Model 2**
- True: **R² = 0.147**, **Adj R² = 0.130**
- Generated: **R² = 0.126943**, **Adj R² = 0.100285**

### Fix
Once you correct **N**, DV coding, and weighting/missingness rules, R² should move toward the published values. If it still doesn’t:
- Verify the DV is the **same scale** (count of disliked genres vs some other transformation).
- Verify the IVs are coded identically (especially “racism score” and religious/race dummies).

---

## 3) Intercept/Constant: wrong (and also misinterpreted)

### Mismatch
**Model 1 constant**
- True: **2.415***  
- Generated: **2.597538***  

**Model 2 constant**
- True: **7.860** *(no significance shown in the paper)*  
- Generated: **5.497250***  

### Additional interpretation problem
Your output labels the constant as **“unstandardized intercept”** while simultaneously presenting the rest as **“Beta (standardized)”**. Bryson’s table reports **standardized coefficients**, but the constant is inherently **unstandardized** in many software outputs. In the paper, however, the constant is still printed and must match the fitted model in that specific sample/coding.

### Fix
- You must run the model on the correct sample/specification; intercepts will then align.
- Don’t claim the paper “standardized OLS coefficients” implies intercept comparability across models unless you are matching the *same estimation*.
- Ensure Model 2 constant is reported exactly as in the table (**7.860**) and **do not add stars** unless the paper reports them. (Your generated output adds `***` that the true table does not show.)

---

## 4) Variable naming mismatches (table labels)

### Mismatch
- Generated uses **“Conservative Protestant (proxy)”**
- True uses **“Conservative Protestant”**

This is not merely cosmetic: calling it a “proxy” signals it may be constructed differently than Bryson’s indicator.

### Fix
- Use the **exact definition** Bryson used for “Conservative Protestant” (likely a denomination-based classification).
- Rename the variable in the output to match exactly: **Conservative Protestant** (no “proxy”) if it truly matches.

Everything else is mostly label-aligned (Age vs age_years, etc.), but the Conservative Protestant label is explicitly inconsistent.

## 5) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 1)

True Model 1 coefficients vs Generated “Beta (standardized)”:

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130** (**) | **0.124838** (*) | value + significance mismatch |
| Education | **-0.175** (***) | **-0.204768** (***) | value mismatch |
| Household income per capita | **-0.037** | **+0.034275** | **sign reversal** |
| Occupational prestige | **-0.020** | **+0.007645** | sign mismatch |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.072119 | value mismatch |
| Age | **0.163** (***) | **0.147290** (**) | value + significance mismatch |
| Black | **-0.132** (***) | **-0.159876** (**) | value + significance mismatch |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.048091 | value mismatch |
| Other race | **-0.017** | **+0.007155** | sign mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.094301 | value mismatch |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.065995 | value mismatch |
| Southern | **+0.024** | **-0.015990** | sign mismatch |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.597538*** | value mismatch |

### Fixes (Model 1)
1. **DV construction must match**: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin Music”  
   - Confirm it is exactly a **count of 6** (0–6) based on the same “dislike” threshold Bryson used.
2. **Income and prestige sign flips** strongly suggest:
   - reversed coding (e.g., higher income coded lower),
   - use of different income metric (per capita vs household),
   - or a different standardization method/sample.
3. **Southern sign flip** suggests regional coding differs (South=1 vs non-South=1).
4. **Race category coding**: ensure White is the reference and “Other race” matches the paper definition (not including Hispanics if Hispanic is separate).
5. **Significance stars**: compute using the same SE method (likely conventional OLS) *but note* Bryson doesn’t report SEs—still, stars depend on t-tests. If you use robust SEs, clustering, or weights with design-based SEs, stars will differ.

## 6) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 2)

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **+0.080** | **-0.033651** | **sign reversal** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.218978*** | value mismatch |
| Household income per capita | -0.065 | -0.029831 | value mismatch |
| Occupational prestige | +0.005 | -0.029005 | sign mismatch |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.076210 | close but mismatch |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.111857* | value + significance mismatch |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.046398 | close but mismatch (no stars either way) |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.025117 | close but mismatch |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.079548 | value mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.104412 | value mismatch (large) |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.015457 | value mismatch |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.083480 | value mismatch |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.497250*** | value + interpretation mismatch |

### Fixes (Model 2)
- The **racism sign reversal** is the biggest red flag: you are not reproducing the paper’s specification/data.
  - Check whether your racism scale is reversed (high=racist vs high=tolerant).
  - Check whether the DV is reversed (count of dislikes vs likes).
- Occupational prestige sign mismatch again points to coding differences (or sample/weights).
- Conservative Protestant is about **double** the published magnitude; suggests definition mismatch (“proxy” issue).

## 7) Standard errors: you can’t “match” them because the paper doesn’t report them

### Mismatch
Your prompt asks to compare **standard errors**, but:
- **True Results explicitly: no standard errors reported**.
- Generated output also does **not show SEs**—only betas and stars.

### Fix
- Remove any claim that you have “matched SEs” or that SEs differ from the paper. You can only match:
  - standardized coefficients,
  - stars (p-value thresholds),
  - R²/Adj R²,
  - N,
  - intercept as printed.

If you want to validate SEs, you’d need the original data and replicate the regression; you can’t compare to Table 2.

---

## 8) Significance stars mismatches (interpretation errors)

### Model 1 star mismatches
- **Racism score**: True `**`, Generated `*`
- **Age**: True `***`, Generated `**`
- **Black**: True `***`, Generated `**`

### Model 2 star mismatches
- **Age**: True `**`, Generated `*`
- **Constant**: True shows no stars; Generated shows `***`

### Fix
Once the sample/specification matches, the stars should align. If coefficients match but stars don’t:
- You may be using **robust SEs** while Bryson used conventional OLS SEs (or vice versa).
- You may be using **different degrees of freedom** (from weights/design corrections).
- You may be running **two-tailed vs one-tailed** (paper states two-tailed).

---

## 9) Interpretation mismatch: racism in Model 2

### Mismatch
- True Model 2 racism effect is **positive (0.080)** (though not significant)
- Generated Model 2 racism effect is **negative (-0.033651)**

### Fix (interpretation + code)
- Verify the racism score direction:
  - If higher values mean **more racist**, then a positive coefficient means **more racism → more dislikes**.
  - If your scale is reversed, reverse it: e.g., `racism = max(racism) - racism` (or re-code items before summing).
- Verify DV direction: ensure DV counts **dislikes**, not likes or tolerance.

---

## 10) Practical “make it match” checklist (what to change in the generated analysis)

To get the generated analysis to reproduce Bryson Table 2:

1. **Recreate DVs exactly**
   - Model 1 DV: dislike count of 6 specified genres.
   - Model 2 DV: dislike count of remaining 12 genres.
   - Use the exact dislike coding threshold used in Bryson.

2. **Recreate IVs exactly**
   - Racism score: same items, same direction, same scaling.
   - Conservative Protestant: same classification rule (not an ad-hoc proxy).
   - Region South: same South definition and coding direction.
   - Income per capita: same construction.

3. **Match estimation details**
   - Standard OLS (unless paper used weights/design; then match that exactly).
   - Same missing-data rules → match **N=644** and **N=605**.

4. **Report exactly what the table reports**
   - Standardized coefficients (betas).
   - Do not invent or append SEs.
   - Match stars to the table’s thresholds and two-tailed tests.
   - Print constants exactly (and don’t star Model 2 constant if the table doesn’t).

If you tell me (a) what dataset you used, (b) how you constructed the two DVs, and (c) how “racism score” and “Conservative Protestant (proxy)” were coded, I can pinpoint which specific coding step is causing the sign flips (income, southern, racism) and the N collapse.
