Score: 16/100
============================================================

Below is a line‐by‐line audit of **every mismatch** between your *Generated Results* and Bryson (1996) Table 2 “True Results,” plus what you must change to make the generated analysis match the published table.

---

## 1) Fundamental reporting mismatch (what is being compared)

### (A) “Standard errors” requirement is impossible here
- **True Results:** Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients only** and **does not report standard errors** (nor t’s).
- **Generated Results:** also reports standardized betas and “Sig” stars, but **no SEs**. That part is *not a mismatch*—it’s consistent with the table format.
- **Fix:** If you need SEs, you must compute them from your replication model output, but they **won’t be comparable to Table 2**. For matching the paper, **remove any mention of SEs** and compare only betas, N, R²/Adj. R², constant, and significance stars.

### (B) You are not replicating the same analytic sample
- **True Results N:** Model 1 = **644**, Model 2 = **605**
- **Generated Results N (combined_fit):** Model 1 = **261**, Model 2 = **259**
- **Generated dv_descriptives N:** 1134 and 1057 (these are not the regression N’s)
- **Fix:** Recreate Bryson’s sample restrictions, missing-data handling, and (likely) weights:
  1. Use the same **dataset/year and subsample** as Bryson.
  2. Use the same **listwise deletion** rule the paper used for Table 2 (almost certainly listwise on all covariates in the model).
  3. Apply the same **survey weights** (GSS weight variable) if Bryson did. Not doing so can change N (because of exclusions) and coefficients/stars.
  4. Ensure the DV construction uses the **exact genre items** and the **same coding of “dislike”** and missingness.

Until N matches (644/605), coefficient mismatches are expected.

## 2) DV (dependent variable) mismatches

### Model 1 DV label is fine, but constants and ranges suggest DV construction differences
- **True constant (Model 1):** 2.415***
- **Generated constant (Model 1):** 2.627630***
- **Fix:** This usually signals the DV is not coded identically (or the sample differs). Verify:
  - The six “minority-linked” genres are exactly: **Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin**.
  - “Dislike” is counted exactly as in Bryson (e.g., bottom category vs “dislike”+“strongly dislike”, etc.). A one-step difference in thresholding changes the mean and constant.

### Model 2 DV: generated constant is wildly off
- **True constant (Model 2):** 7.860 (no stars shown in your excerpt)
- **Generated constant (Model 2):** 5.269834***
- **Fix:** This is a major sign your Model 2 DV is not the same “12 remaining genres” set and/or your “dislike” threshold differs, and/or your sample differs. Confirm:
  - You used *exactly* the same 12 genre items Bryson used (and did not inadvertently drop/add genres).
  - You used the same rule for missing genre responses (paper may treat “don’t know” differently).

---

## 3) Variable-name / variable-definition mismatches

These are mostly definitional, but they matter because wrong construction changes coefficients.

### (A) Race/ethnicity construction
- **Generated:** “Hispanic (constructed from ETHNIC; missing preserved)” + “Black (1=Black)” + “Other race”
- **True:** “Hispanic” is a separate row in the table; Bryson’s construction may not be “ETHNIC with missing preserved.”  
- **Fix:** Replicate Bryson’s coding rules exactly:
  - Identify whether “Hispanic” is based on **self-identified Hispanic origin** (often a separate item), and whether Hispanics are excluded from Black/White categories or can overlap.
  - Ensure **reference category** matches the paper (likely White non-Hispanic).

### (B) Religion variables (major mismatch in your regression)
- **Generated:** “No religion … dropped (no variation in analytic sample)” in both models.
- **True:** “No religion” is included with coefficients (Model1: 0.057; Model2: 0.024).
- **Fix:** Your “no_religion” variable is incorrectly constructed or your sample restriction accidentally eliminated variation.
  - Check the RELIG coding: “no religion” in GSS is typically **RELIG = 4**, but you must ensure you didn’t recode missing/NA into 0 for everyone.
  - Do **not** “preserve missing” as a separate category for a dummy without also including a missing-indicator strategy; otherwise you can create all-zeros after listwise deletion.
  - Ensure you are not filtering to only religious respondents somewhere upstream.

### (C) Conservative Protestant proxy likely wrong
- **Generated:** “RELIG==1 & DENOM==1”
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant” is a standard classification usually built from **detailed denomination/fundamentalist classification**, not simply RELIG and DENOM equals 1.
- **Fix:** Use the same conservative Protestant definition Bryson used (often derived from FUND or denomination scheme). A proxy will not reproduce the table.

### (D) Region / “Southern”
- **Generated:** “Southern (REGION==3; missing preserved)”
- **True:** “Southern” is included but your sign differs in Model 1 (see below).
- **Fix:** Confirm REGION coding: in many schemes, “South” is one category but not always “3”. Use the correct South indicator (and correct base category).

## 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 1)

True Model 1 betas vs Generated Model 1 Std_Beta:

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.139* | **Stars differ** (should be ** not *) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.260*** | **Magnitude off** (too negative) |
| Household income pc | -0.037 | -0.015 | **Magnitude off** |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.058 | **Sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.033 | **Magnitude off** |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.174** | **Stars differ** (*** vs **) |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.176* | **Stars differ and magnitude off** |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.039 | **Magnitude off** |
| Other race | -0.017 | 0.002 | **Sign wrong** |
| Conservative Prot | 0.063 | 0.115 | **Magnitude off** |
| No religion | 0.057 | NaN (dropped) | **Variable missing** |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.051 | **Sign wrong** |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.628*** | **Value off** |
| R² | 0.145 | 0.179 | **Value off** |
| Adj. R² | 0.129 | 0.143 | **Value off** |
| N | 644 | 261 | **Value off** |

### How to fix Model 1 to match
1. **Match N=644** by applying the correct sample restrictions and missing-data handling (listwise deletion + correct variable coding).
2. Rebuild **Conservative Protestant** correctly (not the RELIG/DENOM shortcut).
3. Fix **No religion** so it’s not dropped.
4. Verify **Southern** coding (your sign reversal is a red flag of wrong region coding or different base).
5. Verify DV coding and “dislike” threshold to move constant and fit statistics toward the published ones.

## 5) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (Model 2)

True Model 2 betas vs Generated Model 2 Std_Beta:

| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch type |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.014 | **Sign wrong** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.165* | **Magnitude + stars wrong** |
| Household income pc | -0.065 | -0.081 | **Somewhat off** |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.081 | **Sign wrong** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.082 | **Close** (slightly off) |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.123 (no star) | **Stars differ** |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.041 | **Matches closely** (stars consistent: none) |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.054 | **Magnitude off** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.132* | **Magnitude + stars wrong** |
| Conservative Prot | 0.048 | 0.138 | **Magnitude off** |
| No religion | 0.024 | NaN (dropped) | **Variable missing** |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.113 | **Magnitude off** |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.270*** | **Value + stars mismatch** |
| R² | 0.147 | 0.154 | **Close but not equal** |
| Adj. R² | 0.130 | 0.116 | **Off** |
| N | 605 | 259 | **Value off** |

### How to fix Model 2 to match
Model 2 is further off than Model 1, suggesting **DV construction and/or genre set** is wrong in addition to sample/covariates.

1. **Rebuild the “12 remaining genres” DV** to match Bryson’s exact list. Your constant (5.27 vs 7.86) strongly suggests you are counting a different number of “dislikes” or using a stricter dislike threshold.
2. Fix **No religion** and **Conservative Protestant** definitions (same issues as Model 1).
3. Match **N=605** via correct sample and listwise deletion.
4. Recheck the racism score coding (0–5) and ensure it uses the same component items and direction; your racism coefficient flips sign.

---

## 6) Interpretation/significance mismatches

### (A) Significance stars are not reproducible without matching SEs/t’s—and you don’t have the same N
- **Example:** Racism Model 1 is ** in the paper but * in yours; Age is *** in paper but ** in yours.
- **Fix:** Stars will only match if:
  - you reproduce the same **coefficients**, and
  - you reproduce the same **standard errors**, which depend on sample, weights, and model specification.
  - Table 2 uses **two-tailed tests**; ensure your p-values are two-tailed.

### (B) Incorrect inference risk: “dropped (no variation)” is not a substantive finding
- **Generated interpretation risk:** Dropping “No religion” could be misread as “not important.”
- **Fix:** Treat this as a **data/recoding error** (given the paper clearly includes it). Reconstruct the variable and rerun.

---

## 7) Concrete “make it match” checklist (actionable)

To force alignment with Bryson Table 2:

1. **Use the same sample** Bryson used (same survey year(s), same population restrictions).
2. **Implement listwise deletion** exactly on the variables in each model; confirm resulting **N=644 and N=605**.
3. **Reconstruct racism score** from the same five dichotomies with the same direction.
4. **Reconstruct religion variables**:
   - “No religion” must vary and be included.
   - “Conservative Protestant” must match Bryson’s classification (not a crude proxy).
5. **Rebuild DVs exactly**:
   - Model 1: count dislikes for the six specified genres using Bryson’s dislike threshold.
   - Model 2: count dislikes across the exact remaining 12 genres, same threshold.
6. **Use standardized OLS coefficients** (beta weights) and report them with the same star cutoffs (two-tailed).
7. (If applicable) apply **survey weights** and the same handling of “don’t know/NA” on genre items.

If you tell me (a) which dataset extract/year you used (e.g., which GSS years), (b) your exact “dislike” coding rule, and (c) how you defined Conservative Protestant, I can pinpoint which single change is most responsible for the sign flips (especially racism and occupational prestige in Model 2).
