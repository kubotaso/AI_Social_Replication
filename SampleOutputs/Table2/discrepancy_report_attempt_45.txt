Score: 20/100
============================================================

## 1) Fundamental incompatibility: you compared different kinds of output

### Mismatch
- **True Table 2 reports only standardized coefficients (betas) + significance stars. No SEs.**
- Your **Generated Results** include:
  - “paper_style” tables that *look* like standardized coefficients with stars, **but**
  - “full” tables with **unstandardized coefficients (`b_unstd`) + SEs + t + p**, and a `beta_std`.
- Because Table 2 doesn’t publish SEs, **any SEs/p-values/stars derived from SEs cannot be validated against the PDF**. If you want to match Table 2, you must match **betas and stars**, and match **N / R² / adj R²**—not SEs.

### Fix
- Decide the target:
  1) **Match Bryson Table 2 exactly** → report **standardized betas + stars only**, and use the paper’s **N/R²/Adj R²**. Do **not** print SEs.
  2) If you insist on SEs → you must re-run the regression on the **same GSS 1993 analytic sample with the same construction rules**; then your SEs will be “new results,” not “Table 2.”

---

## 2) Variable-name/order mismatches (your tables are unlabeled)

### Mismatch
- In `ModelA_paper_style` and `ModelB_paper_style`, the coefficient rows **have no variable names**. That makes it impossible to verify alignment.
- There is also a blank/`NaN` row in both paper-style tables, suggesting a **dropped predictor** or formatting mis-merge.

### Fix
- Output must explicitly index coefficients by the Table 2 variable names, in the Table 2 order:
  - Racism score; Education; Income/capita; Occupational prestige; Female; Age; Black; Hispanic; Other race; Conservative Protestant; No religion; Southern; Constant.
- Remove any placeholder `NaN` rows by fixing the join/concat logic (common cause: merging stars onto coefficients by position after dropping a variable).

---

## 3) Coefficient mismatches: Model 1 (your “ModelA_*” vs True Model 1)

Below I interpret your `ModelA_paper_style` as the standardized betas (because they match your `beta_std` column in `ModelA_full`).

### Model 1 true vs generated (standardized betas)

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **0.130**\*\* | **0.127** (no stars) | star mismatch; small coef diff |
| Education | **-0.175**\*\*\* | **-0.257**\*\* | coef too negative; stars too weak |
| Income per capita | -0.037 | 0.036 | **wrong sign** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | 0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.041 | magnitude off |
| Age | **0.163**\*\*\* | 0.146 | stars missing; magnitude off |
| Black | **-0.132**\*\*\* | **-0.173**\* | magnitude off; stars far too weak |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.079 | magnitude off |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.021 | close (ok-ish) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.081 | magnitude off |
| No religion | 0.057 | **(dropped / NaN row)** | **missing predictor** |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.019 | **wrong sign** |
| Constant | **2.415**\*\*\* | **2.918**\*\*\* | intercept mismatch |

### Fixes for Model 1 mismatches
To make your estimates match Table 2, you need the same:
1) **Sample definition**: Your `n=203` vs true `N=644` is a huge discrepancy and will change everything (coefficients, signs, significance).
2) **DV construction**: Ensure your DV is *exactly* “number of disliked genres among Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin,” with Bryson’s coding for “dislike.”
3) **Predictor construction**: Ensure variables are coded the same way (especially race dummies, “Southern,” “No religion,” and “Conservative Protestant”).
4) **Weights/design**: Bryson’s table is from GSS; if the paper used weights (likely), you must apply the same weight variable. Different weighting changes betas.
5) **Standardization method**: Standardize continuously measured variables consistently (typically z-scoring). For dummies, “standardized beta” depends on software convention; you must replicate the paper’s approach (often regression on standardized X and standardized Y, or post-hoc beta conversion).
6) **No religion dropped**: Your fit table says `dropped_zero_variance_predictors = no_religion`. That indicates “no_religion” is constant in your analysis sample (e.g., everyone has a religion, or missingness collapsed).
   - Fix by correcting the **filtering** that collapses the sample (see section 5), and verifying “no_religion” is coded with variation.

## 4) Coefficient mismatches: Model 2 (your “ModelB_*” vs True Model 2)

### Model 2 true vs generated (standardized betas)

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.018 | **wrong sign** |
| Education | **-0.242**\*\*\* | **-0.263**\*\* | close-ish coef; stars too weak |
| Income per capita | -0.065 | -0.059 | close-ish |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.089 | **wrong sign; big magnitude** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.095 | somewhat off |
| Age | **0.126**\*\* | -0.007 | **wrong sign** |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.059 | close-ish |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.042 | close-ish |
| Other race | 0.047 | **0.145**\* | much larger; stars shouldn’t be there |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.119 | too large |
| No religion | 0.024 | **(dropped / NaN row)** | **missing predictor** |
| Southern | 0.069 | **0.186**\*\* | too large; stars mismatch |
| Constant | 7.860 | 7.148\*\*\* | intercept and stars mismatch (paper reports no stars here) |

### Fixes for Model 2 mismatches
Same root causes as Model 1, but the **sign flips (racism, age)** strongly suggest you are not reproducing the paper’s:
- **DV definition** (“12 remaining genres”) and/or
- **coding direction** (what counts as “dislike”), and/or
- **sample**.

---

## 5) Sample size + fit statistics mismatches (this is the biggest red flag)

### Mismatch
- **True**: Model 1 `N=644`, `R²=.145`, `Adj R²=.129`; Model 2 `N=605`, `R²=.147`, `Adj R²=.130`.
- **Generated**: Model A `n=203`, `R²=.169`, `Adj R²=.121`; Model B `n=197`, `R²=.194`, `Adj R²=.147`.

These are not small deviations; they indicate **you’re analyzing a different dataset, year, subset, or applying very restrictive listwise deletion**.

### Fix
- Recreate Bryson’s analytic sample:
  - Use **GSS 1993** (confirm correct file/year).
  - Apply the paper’s **missing-data rules**. If you did listwise deletion across *all* music items + all predictors, you can shrink N dramatically.
  - Check whether Bryson used imputation, different missing handling, or excluded some predictors with high missingness.
- Ensure you included all relevant cases for the music module (many respondents won’t have all items asked; the paper likely defines inclusion in a particular way).

---

## 6) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation mismatches)

### Mismatch
Because your stars are derived from your model’s p-values, and your model doesn’t match the paper’s sample/spec, your stars differ widely:
- Model 1: racism should be ** (you have none); education should be *** (you have **); age should be *** (you have none); black should be *** (you have *).
- Model 2: education should be *** (you have **); age should be ** (you have none); southern should be none or * at most (paper shows 0.069 with no stars; you show **).

### Fix
- Once you reproduce the sample and variable coding, **compute stars using the same thresholds** (you stated: * p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001).
- But again: if you’re trying to match Table 2 exactly, you should *not* be generating stars from SEs unless you exactly replicate the original regression. Otherwise, you’ll need to copy the stars as printed (which is not ideal scientifically, but matches the table).

---

## 7) Intercept/constant mismatches

### Mismatch
- Model 1 constant: true 2.415*** vs generated 2.918***.
- Model 2 constant: true 7.860 (no stars shown in your “True Results” summary) vs generated 7.148***.

Intercept differences are expected when:
- the DV is coded differently (e.g., different count range),
- the sample differs,
- predictors are centered/standardized differently,
- weights differ.

### Fix
- Verify DV coding and range.
- Ensure you are not running a model with standardized DV but reporting an unstandardized intercept, or vice versa.
- Replicate paper’s coding and sample first; intercept should then move closer.

---

## 8) The “No religion” dropped (zero variance) is a concrete discrepancy

### Mismatch
- True table includes “No religion” with nonzero betas in both models.
- Your fit output explicitly says `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: no_religion`.

### Fix
- Debug your construction of `no_religion`:
  - Confirm it’s a dummy where 1 = no religion, 0 = otherwise (or vice versa), and that both values exist.
  - Check that you didn’t accidentally filter to only religious respondents (e.g., by requiring non-missing church attendance).
  - Confirm you didn’t recode missing religion as 0 and then filter on something that forces all to 0.
- After fixing coding/sample, the `NaN` row in paper-style tables should disappear and “No religion” should have a coefficient.

---

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1) **Use the correct data**: GSS 1993, correct music dislike items.
2) **Reproduce DVs exactly**: two counts (minority-associated 6; remaining 12).
3) **Match predictor coding**: especially racism scale, race dummies, South, religion categories.
4) **Match inclusion rules** to get N≈644 and N≈605 (not ~200).
5) **Apply same weighting/standardization conventions** as the paper.
6) **Output**: show standardized betas + stars (no SEs), and report N/R²/Adj R² matching the paper.
7) **Label variables** and remove `NaN` placeholder rows.

If you paste your codebook (variable names in your dataset) and the exact filtering/recoding steps you used, I can pinpoint which step is driving the N collapse and the sign flips (racism, age, prestige, south).
