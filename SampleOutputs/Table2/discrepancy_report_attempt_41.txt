============================================================

## 1) Model-level mismatches (N, R²/Adj R², constant)

### A. Sample size (N)
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=261; Model 2 N=259  
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605  
- **Fix:** Your analytic sample is not the paper’s. To match Bryson (1996), you must replicate **the same dataset/wave, inclusion criteria, and missing-data handling** used in the article. Most likely problems:
  - You are running models on a **subset** (e.g., only respondents with complete data on constructed variables you created, or a filtered year/module).
  - You are using **listwise deletion** after creating variables with extra missingness (see “Hispanic … otherwise missing” and religion proxy below).
  - You may be using the wrong file (e.g., a later GSS wave, a reduced extract, or only cases who answered all music items).
- **Concrete fix:** Rebuild the sample to mirror the paper:
  1. Use the same survey year(s) and the same music battery used by Bryson.
  2. Construct DV1 and DV2 from the same items and coding.
  3. Use the same handling of missing responses to genre items (paper likely uses respondents with enough answered items; do not automatically drop anyone with one missing item unless the paper did).
  4. Handle race/ethnicity/religion in a way that does **not** create structural missingness.

### B. R² and adjusted R²
- **Generated:** Model1 R²=0.178, AdjR²=0.142; Model2 R²=0.151, AdjR²=0.114  
- **True:** Model1 R²=0.145, AdjR²=0.129; Model2 R²=0.147, AdjR²=0.130  
- **Fix:** Once you correct (i) sample, (ii) variable construction, and (iii) covariate definitions (especially religion and Hispanic), R² should move toward the printed values. Right now the higher Model1 R² is consistent with a smaller, selected sample and/or different DV scaling.

### C. Constant / intercept
- **Generated:** Model1 constant 2.593***; Model2 constant 5.185***  
- **True:** Model1 constant 2.415***; Model2 constant 7.860 (printed; note: the table shows no stars for this constant)  
- **Fix:** Intercepts depend heavily on DV coding and sample. Your Model2 constant being far lower strongly suggests **your DV2 scale is not the same as the paper’s** (e.g., different range, different number of items counted, different coding of “dislike,” or different standardization/centering). Recreate DV2 exactly as “dislike of the 12 remaining genres” as operationalized in the article.

---

## 2) Variable-definition and naming mismatches

### A. “Racism score (0–5)” vs “Racism score”
- **Mismatch:** Naming is minor, but the key issue is **your coefficient differs** (see §3). Also, labeling “0–5” implies a specific construction that may not match Bryson’s.
- **Fix:** Verify you used the same racism scale items, coding direction, and scaling (and whether the paper standardizes the racism score itself before computing standardized betas).

### B. Hispanic variable construction is not the paper’s
- **Generated name:** “Hispanic (derived from ETHNIC if detectable; otherwise missing)”  
- **True variable:** “Hispanic” (included with coefficient; not described as partially missing)
- **Mismatch:** Your approach explicitly creates missingness (“otherwise missing”), which will (i) shrink N and (ii) change coefficients for many variables.
- **Fix:** Use the same definition as the article (typically a binary indicator from a race/ethnicity classification that exists for all cases used). Practically: create **mutually exclusive race/ethnicity dummies** that cover everyone (with White non-Hispanic as reference), and **do not leave “Hispanic” missing** for people whose Hispanic status can’t be “detected.”

### C. Conservative Protestant is a proxy in your model, not Bryson’s measure
- **Generated:** “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”  
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant”
- **Mismatch:** Bryson likely uses a standard religious tradition coding (e.g., fundamentalist/conservative Protestant classification) rather than your crude RELIG/DENOM conjunction.
- **Fix:** Recode religion using a recognized classification consistent with the period (e.g., **Steensland et al. RELTRAD-type** scheme, or whatever Bryson used). At minimum, replicate his categories so that “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion” exist for all respondents.

### D. “No religion” is wrongly dropped (and should not be)
- **Generated:** “No religion (RELIG==4)” is **NaN / dropped (no variation)**; also “Dropped_no_variation = no_religion”
- **True:** “No religion” is included in both models (0.057 in M1; 0.024 in M2)
- **Mismatch:** In a national sample N=600+, “no religion” cannot have zero variance. This is a clear coding/sample construction error.
- **Likely cause:** You filtered to a subgroup where RELIG is constant, or you recoded RELIG incorrectly (e.g., all missing set to 4, or all 4 recoded away), or you created `no_religion` after listwise deletion left only one category.
- **Fix:** Before regression, check frequency tables on the analytic sample:
  - `tab RELIG` and `tab no_religion`
  - ensure missing values are not being recoded into a single category
  - ensure you did not inadvertently subset to only religious respondents
  Then include `no_religion` as a normal dummy (with an appropriate reference group).

## 3) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below are **every** coefficient mismatch (generated vs true). I list the true value, your value, direction change if any, and what to fix.

### Model 1 (DV1: minority-linked 6)
| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch type | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.140* | wrong significance (and slightly off) | match sample + racism scale construction + SE/p-values method (see §4) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.260*** | magnitude too large | sample selection + standardization method likely wrong |
| Income pc | -0.037 | -0.012 | too small | income definition/cleaning + sample |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | 0.058 | **sign flip** | prestige variable mismatch (PRESTG80 may not match) and/or sample/weights |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.034 | too small | sample + coding of female |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.175** | significance lower and slightly off | p-value computation + sample |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.177* | wrong magnitude and much weaker sig | race coding + sample + p-value computation |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.007 | far too small | your Hispanic variable is not Bryson’s and is partly missing |
| Other race | -0.017 | -0.005 | too small | race coding differences |
| Cons Prot | 0.063 | 0.120 | too large | your proxy is not the same construct |
| No religion | 0.057 | dropped/NaN | **omitted variable** | fix `no_religion` variance/coding |
| Southern | 0.024 | -0.059 | **sign flip** | region coding mismatch (REGION==3 may not be “South” in the same way) and/or sample |

### Model 2 (DV2: remaining 12)
| Variable | True | Generated | Mismatch type | Fix |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.013 | **sign flip** | racism scale or DV2 construction differs; sample/weights |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.165* | too small + wrong sig | sample + DV2 construction + p-values |
| Income pc | -0.065 | -0.077 | close but not same | income definition/sample |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.079 | **sign flip** | prestige variable mismatch/sample |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.082 | somewhat larger | sample |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.127* | wrong sig level | p-value computation/sample |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.039 | close | (minor; sample/p-values) |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.023 | close | (but still: your Hispanic is not right conceptually) |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.122* | too large | race coding/sample |
| Cons Prot | 0.048 | 0.142* | too large | your proxy not the same |
| No religion | 0.024 | dropped/NaN | **omitted variable** | fix `no_religion` |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.104 | too large | region coding/sample |
| Constant | 7.860 | 5.185*** | wrong level and stars | DV2 scaling mismatch; also stars shouldn’t be inferred from paper table |

## 4) Standard errors and significance: interpretation/reporting mismatches

### A. The true table does **not** report standard errors
- **User request:** “mismatch in … standard errors”  
- **Issue:** Your generated output **does not show SEs either**, but it *does* show significance stars. The problem is interpretive: you are presenting significance as if directly comparable to the printed table, but:
  - Your p-values come from your regression on a different sample with different variable definitions.
  - The paper’s stars correspond to its own t-tests (and possibly weighting/design choices).
- **Fix:** To match the table:
  1. Do not invent or infer SEs from Table 2 (none are provided).
  2. Reproduce stars only after reproducing the exact model, sample, and estimation approach (including any weights/design corrections if used).

### B. Your stars don’t match the printed stars
Examples:
- Model 1 racism: **true 0.130\*\*** vs generated 0.140\*  
- Model 1 age: **true 0.163\*\*\*** vs generated 0.175\*\*  
- Model 1 black: **true -0.132\*\*\*** vs generated -0.177\*  
- Model 2 education: **true -0.242\*\*\*** vs generated -0.165\*
- **Fix:** After fixing variables and N, ensure you compute p-values the same way (OLS t-tests). If Bryson used survey weights or complex design corrections, implement them; otherwise you’ll still miss stars.

---

## 5) Standardized beta computation: likely methodological mismatch

The paper reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. Your values are labeled “Std_Beta,” but several patterns suggest you may not be reproducing standardized betas the same way (or your DV differs):
- Large discrepancies for education and prestige
- Intercept reported alongside standardized betas (intercepts are usually from unstandardized models; papers often mix reporting)
- **Fix:** To match Bryson’s “standardized coefficients”:
  - Either run OLS on **z-scored DV and z-scored Xs** (then coefficients equal standardized betas and intercept ≈ 0), OR
  - Run OLS on raw variables and then compute standardized betas as:  
    \[
    \beta^{std}_j = b_j \cdot \frac{\sigma_{X_j}}{\sigma_Y}
    \]
  Bryson’s table includes a nonzero constant, suggesting he likely estimated on the **raw DV** and then reported **standardized slopes** (plus the raw intercept). Replicate that: estimate unstandardized model, keep intercept, transform slopes to standardized betas.

## 6) Region and prestige variables: high-risk coding mismatches

### A. Southern (REGION==3)
- **Generated:** “Southern (REGION==3)”
- **True:** “Southern”
- **Mismatch:** Even if REGION==3 is South in your file, Bryson’s “Southern” may be a different coding (South vs non-South, or a Census-region recode including border states).
- **Fix:** Confirm the exact South definition used in the paper (often “Census South”). Recode accordingly and ensure it’s defined for all cases.

### B. Occupational prestige (PRESTG80)
- **Generated uses:** PRESTG80
- **True:** “Occupational prestige”
- **Mismatch:** Bryson may have used a different prestige measure, different year-specific prestige scale, or handled nonworkers differently. Your sign flips (M1 and M2) are a red flag.
- **Fix:** Identify the prestige variable used in the original study, including how missing occupation (unemployed/retired/never worked) was treated. Apply the same rule (e.g., set to missing vs impute vs include “no occupation” category).

## 7) What you need to change so the generated analysis matches the true table

1. **Recreate the correct analytic sample** (target N≈644 and 605).  
   - Use the same data source/year(s), same respondents, and same missing-data strategy as Bryson.
2. **Rebuild DV1 and DV2 exactly** as in the article (same 6 genres, same remaining 12, same “dislike” coding, same aggregation).
3. **Fix religion coding**:
   - Do not use the RELIG==1 & DENOM==1 proxy.
   - Ensure “No religion” varies and is included.
4. **Fix Hispanic and race dummies**:
   - Avoid “detectable; otherwise missing.”
   - Use a complete classification so N doesn’t collapse and coefficients align.
5. **Compute standardized coefficients the way the paper did**:
   - Standardize slopes from the unstandardized model (keeping the unstandardized intercept), unless the paper explicitly standardized variables prior to estimation.
6. **Match estimation details**:
   - If Bryson used weights or survey corrections, apply them; otherwise stars won’t line up even after coding fixes.

If you share (a) the exact code you used to build DV1/DV2 and (b) how you constructed racism, Hispanic, conservative Protestant, and the sample restrictions, I can point to the specific line(s) that are causing the N collapse and the sign flips.
