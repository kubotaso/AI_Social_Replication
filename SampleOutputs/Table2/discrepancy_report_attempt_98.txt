Score: 10/100
============================================================

### A. Structural/reporting mismatches (prevent a valid comparison)

1) **Standard errors shown vs. none in the true table**
- **Generated:** asks for/implicitly suggests “standard errors” comparisons, but the generated output **does not actually report SEs** either (only “Std_Beta” and stars).
- **True:** Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients only; no SEs/t-stats**.
- **Fix:** Do **not** invent or request SEs. Your comparison should be limited to: *variable names, standardized betas, significance stars, N, R², adj. R², constant (but see #6), and interpretation.*

2) **Wrong sample size (N)**
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=340; Model 2 N=326.
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605.
- **Fix:** Use the same dataset/waves and inclusion rules as Bryson (1996), and replicate his missing-data handling. Very likely your pipeline is restricting to a much smaller analytic sample (e.g., complete-case on additional constructed variables, or using a subset year/module).  
  - Concretely: verify you are using the same survey, same year(s), same population restrictions, and the same coding of the DV genre “dislike” counts.

3) **Wrong model fit (R² and adjusted R²)**
- **Generated:** Model1 R²=0.205 (Adj=0.181); Model2 R²=0.167 (Adj=0.141).
- **True:** Model1 R²=0.145 (Adj=0.129); Model2 R²=0.147 (Adj=0.130).
- **Fix:** Once the **sample** and **DV construction** match the paper, R² should move toward the published values. If N matches but R² still differs, then the DV/IV codings differ (see below).

4) **“Dropped (no variation)” for No religion**
- **Generated:** “No religion” dropped (no variation) in both models.
- **True:** “No religion” is included with coefficients (0.057 in M1; 0.024 in M2).
- **Fix:** Your “no_religion” variable is incorrectly created (likely all 0s in your analytic sample because of a recode error or filtering).  
  - Check frequency: `tab no_religion` (or equivalent).  
  - Ensure the religion variable is coded into mutually exclusive dummies with a clear reference category (and that “no religion” exists in the retained cases).  
  - Don’t drop it unless truly constant; if it is constant, your sample restriction is wrong.

### B. Variable-name mismatches / missing variables

5) **Hispanic is completely missing**
- **Generated:** No “Hispanic” row in either model.
- **True:** Hispanic is included in both models (M1: -0.058; M2: -0.029).
- **Fix:** Add a **Hispanic dummy** consistent with Bryson’s race/ethnicity scheme and include it in both regressions. If you have a single race variable, you must create the same dummy set used in the paper (Black, Hispanic, Other race) with White as reference.

6) **Race dummy set is inconsistent with the paper**
- **Generated:** includes “Black” and “Other race” only.
- **True:** includes “Black,” “Hispanic,” and “Other race.”
- **Fix:** Reconstruct race/ethnicity dummies to match:  
  - `black = 1{Black}, hispanic = 1{Hispanic}, other_race = 1{Other nonwhite}` with **White as omitted category** (assuming that’s Bryson’s reference, as typical in that table).

### C. Coefficient (beta) mismatches (and sign/stars mismatches)

Below I list every row where the **generated standardized beta and/or significance** does not match the true table.

#### Model 1 (Minority-linked genres: 6)

- **Racism score**
  - Generated: **0.146** ( ** )
  - True: **0.130** ( ** )
  - Mismatch: coefficient magnitude (too high).
  - Fix: likely DV/IV coding/sample mismatch; once corrected, should approach 0.130.

- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.266***  
  - True: **-0.175***  
  - Mismatch: coefficient far more negative.
  - Fix: education scaling/coding differs (e.g., years vs. categories), and/or sample restriction.

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.048** (ns)
  - True: **-0.037** (ns)
  - Mismatch: magnitude.
  - Fix: income-per-capita construction differs (household size adjustment, inflation, trimming/logging).

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **+0.025** (ns)
  - True: **-0.020** (ns)
  - Mismatch: **sign reversal**.
  - Fix: prestige measure likely not the same scale/index (or reversed coding). Confirm you’re using the same occupational prestige score Bryson used and that higher = more prestige.

- **Female**
  - Generated: **-0.027** (ns)
  - True: **-0.057** (ns)
  - Mismatch: magnitude.
  - Fix: gender coding or sample differences.

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.210***  
  - True: **0.163***  
  - Mismatch: magnitude.
  - Fix: age variable scaling or sample mismatch (but sign/stars align).

- **Black**
  - Generated: **-0.133** ( * )
  - True: **-0.132** ( *** )
  - Mismatch: **significance level** (and essentially same beta).
  - Fix: This is a strong sign your **N is wrong** (smaller N inflates SE and weakens significance). Once N≈644, the stars should match (***).

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **missing**
  - True: **-0.058** (ns)
  - Fix: add Hispanic dummy (see #5).

- **Other race**
  - Generated: **+0.010** (ns)
  - True: **-0.017** (ns)
  - Mismatch: sign differs.
  - Fix: race categorization differs because Hispanic is not separated; your “other_race” is absorbing some Hispanic cases and changing interpretation.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated: **0.071** (ns)
  - True: **0.063** (ns)
  - Mismatch: small magnitude difference.
  - Fix: define conservative Protestant denominational family exactly as in Bryson.

- **No religion**
  - Generated: **dropped**
  - True: **0.057** (ns)
  - Fix: see #4.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.017** (ns)
  - True: **0.024** (ns)
  - Mismatch: magnitude.
  - Fix: region coding (South definition) and sample.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **2.657***  
  - True: **2.415***  
  - Mismatch: magnitude.
  - Fix: constants will change with sample and with whether predictors are centered/standardized in the same way. Also, note: a “constant” in a model that reports *standardized coefficients* is tricky—papers often report the unstandardized intercept alongside standardized slopes. You must replicate Bryson’s exact convention.

#### Model 2 (Remaining genres: 12)

- **Racism score**
  - Generated: **0.008** (ns)
  - True: **0.080** (ns)
  - Mismatch: coefficient is near zero vs. 0.080.
  - Fix: racism scale coding likely differs (range, reverse-coding, or standardization done incorrectly), and/or DV differs.

- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.205** ( ** )
  - True: **-0.242** ( *** )
  - Mismatch: magnitude and **stars**.
  - Fix: N mismatch (stars) plus education coding (magnitude).

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.098** (ns)
  - True: **-0.065** (ns)
  - Mismatch: magnitude.
  - Fix: income-per-capita construction mismatch.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **-0.026** (ns)
  - True: **+0.005** (ns)
  - Mismatch: sign reversal (again).
  - Fix: prestige coding/index direction mismatch (see Model 1).

- **Female**
  - Generated: **-0.079** (ns)
  - True: **-0.070** (ns)
  - Close; minor mismatch.

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.132** ( * )
  - True: **0.126** ( ** )
  - Mismatch: significance level.
  - Fix: N mismatch (smaller N → fewer stars).

- **Black**
  - Generated: **0.092** (ns)
  - True: **0.042** (ns)
  - Mismatch: magnitude.
  - Fix: race coding/sample mismatch (and missing Hispanic affecting race comparisons).

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **missing**
  - True: **-0.029** (ns)
  - Fix: add Hispanic dummy.

- **Other race**
  - Generated: **0.116** ( * )
  - True: **0.047** (ns)
  - Mismatch: magnitude and stars.
  - Fix: missing Hispanic + different race categorization + N mismatch.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated: **0.097** (ns)
  - True: **0.048** (ns)
  - Mismatch: magnitude.
  - Fix: denomination coding mismatch.

- **No religion**
  - Generated: dropped
  - True: 0.024 (ns)
  - Fix: see #4.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.121** ( * )
  - True: **0.069** (ns)
  - Mismatch: magnitude and stars.
  - Fix: South definition and N mismatch.

- **Constant**
  - Generated: **5.205***  
  - True: **7.860** (no stars shown)
  - Mismatch: large difference and significance reporting differs.
  - Fix: constants differ because DV construction and/or standardization conventions differ; also Bryson may not have printed stars for the intercept in Model 2 (or your transcription lacks them). Match the paper’s exact presentation.

### D. Interpretation mismatches (what your table implies vs. what the true table says)

7) **Race effects are not comparable because Hispanic is omitted**
- **Generated interpretation risk:** “Other race” and “Black” coefficients are interpreted as if they match Bryson’s categories.
- **True:** race/ethnicity categories are different. Without Hispanic, your “other_race” is not the same variable, so any interpretation is wrong.
- **Fix:** include Hispanic and ensure the same reference group.

8) **“Dropped (no variation)” implies a data error, not a substantive finding**
- **Generated interpretation risk:** could be described as “no-religion absent/irrelevant.”
- **True:** no religion varies and is included.
- **Fix:** correct the recode/sample restriction; do not interpret the drop substantively.

---

### E. What to change in the replication so generated output matches Bryson (1996)

**Priority order (these are the big drivers):**

1) **Match the analytic sample (N=644; 605)**
   - Identify why your complete-case N collapses to 340/326.
   - Ensure you are not (a) using additional variables, (b) applying extra filters, (c) using a different survey/year/module, or (d) accidentally dropping respondents with any “don’t know” that Bryson retained or recoded.

2) **Recreate DVs exactly**
   - Model 1 DV: count of “dislike” across the 6 “minority-linked” genres.
   - Model 2 DV: count of “dislike” across the other 12.
   - Confirm the *response coding* for “dislike” (e.g., 1 if “dislike,” 0 otherwise) and how missing/never heard are handled.

3) **Recreate IV codings exactly**
   - **Racism score:** ensure same items, same direction, same scaling, and then standardize (z-score) if you’re computing standardized betas via standardizing variables.
   - **Education:** confirm unit (years vs categories), then standardize.
   - **Income per capita:** confirm construction (household income / household size?), treatment of top-codes, and whether transformed.
   - **Occupational prestige:** use the same prestige index and direction.
   - **Religion dummies:** conservative Protestant and no religion must vary; define reference category consistent with the paper.
   - **Region:** define “Southern” as in Bryson.

4) **Compute standardized coefficients in the same way the paper does**
   - Either (a) run OLS on raw variables and request standardized betas from the software, or (b) z-standardize X’s (and possibly Y) consistently. Do not mix conventions, especially for the intercept.

If you want, paste your codebook/variable construction rules (especially for racism score, religion dummies, prestige, and the DV dislike indicators), and I can pinpoint which specific recodes are most likely producing the N collapse and the sign reversals on occupational prestige.
