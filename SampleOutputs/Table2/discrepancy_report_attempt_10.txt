Score: 20/100
============================================================

### 1) Structural mismatch: what the “true” table reports vs what you generated
**True (Bryson Table 2):** *standardized OLS coefficients only* (betas) + significance stars; **no standard errors** in the PDF table.  
**Generated:** reports **unstandardized coefficients (`b_unstd`)**, **standardized coefficients (`beta_std`)**, **p-values**, and **stars**.

**Why this is a discrepancy**
- You cannot “match” Table 2 by comparing your unstandardized coefficients or any SEs to the paper, because the paper doesn’t provide those.
- If you compute p-values/stars from your own regression, they may differ from the paper due to **different sample, coding, weighting, missing-data handling**, etc., even if betas are close.

**Fix**
- To match the paper’s presentation, output **only standardized coefficients** (and stars if you want), and **omit SEs entirely** (or clearly label them as “computed from replication data, not from Table 2”).
- If your goal is strict replication: you must replicate **N, variable coding, and estimation choices** first (see sections below).

---

### 2) Dependent-variable mismatch (DV construction)
**True Model 1 DV:** “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” (6 genres)  
**Generated ModelA DV name:** `dislike_minority_genres` / model label includes `dislike_minority6` (sounds intended to match)

**True Model 2 DV:** “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”  
**Generated ModelB DV name:** `dislike_other12_genres` (sounds intended to match)

**But the fit stats suggest the DVs are not constructed from the same underlying sample/coding (see N mismatch below).**

**Fix**
- Recreate the DV indices exactly as Bryson does (GSS 1993 music dislike items, same “dislike” threshold, same treatment of DK/NA).
- Confirm the exact 6 genres and the exact “other 12” list match the paper’s genre set for 1993.

---

### 3) Sample size mismatch (big replication failure)
**True N:** Model 1 **N=644**, Model 2 **N=605**  
**Generated N:** ModelA **n=327**, ModelB **n=308**

That’s roughly **half the expected sample**.

**Likely causes**
- You restricted to a subgroup (e.g., only white respondents, only complete cases on extra variables, only a subset of survey year, etc.).
- You dropped many cases due to missingness because you required complete data on variables not used in Bryson’s model or coded missing incorrectly.
- You may have used a different survey year or different file than **GSS 1993**.
- Weighting/filtering mistakes (e.g., dropping nonrespondents on music items en masse).

**Fix**
- Ensure you’re using **GSS 1993** and the same population Bryson used.
- Apply **the same listwise deletion only on variables in the model** (and DV components), not on extraneous variables.
- Audit missing-data counts variable-by-variable and identify which variable is cutting N in half.

### 4) Predictor set mismatch (you have fewer predictors than the paper)
**True models include 12 predictors + constant:**
1. Racism score  
2. Education  
3. Household income per capita  
4. Occupational prestige  
5. Female  
6. Age  
7. Black  
8. Hispanic  
9. Other race  
10. Conservative Protestant  
11. No religion  
12. Southern  
(+ constant)

**Generated models:** `k_predictors = 10` and say `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: no_religion`.

So you are **missing at least two predictors** relative to the paper (and you explicitly dropped *No religion*).

**Fix**
- Ensure all **12 predictors** are included.
- Do not drop `no_religion` unless it truly has zero variance in your analytic sample—which would itself indicate a **sample restriction/coding error**, because “no religion” obviously varies in the GSS.
- Check that you have *both* religion dummies (Conservative Protestant and No religion) plus the omitted reference category exactly as in the paper.

---

### 5) Variable-name / variable-definition mismatches (implicit but important)
Your tables don’t show variable names per row, but given the count/order, they appear intended to map to the paper’s rows. Several are clearly inconsistent:

#### (A) “No religion” problem
- **True:** “No religion” is included with a nonzero coefficient (Model 1: 0.057; Model 2: 0.024).
- **Generated:** `no_religion` was **dropped for zero variance**.

**Fix**
- Verify coding of `no_religion` (e.g., RELIG==None) and confirm you didn’t accidentally:
  - recode all nonresponses to 0/1 incorrectly,
  - subset to a group where it’s constant,
  - or filter on religiosity in a way that removes variation.

#### (B) Race indicators likely miscoded / reference group mismatch
True coefficients:
- Model 1: Black -0.132***, Hispanic -0.058, Other race -0.017  
- Model 2: Black +0.042 (ns), Hispanic -0.029, Other race +0.047

Generated “race-looking” coefficients include (ModelB) some large positive unstandardized values (e.g., **1.614**, **0.686**) with significance—far larger than you’d expect for a count DV if the scale is similar, and inconsistent with standardized betas in the paper (which are small, ±.1–.2).

**Fix**
- Ensure race variables are **0/1 dummies** with **White as reference** (as typical for this table).
- Ensure DV is in the same scale (count of genres disliked) and not multiplied/reversed.
- Confirm you didn’t accidentally treat race as a multi-level numeric code (e.g., 1,2,3,4) rather than dummies.

### 6) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas don’t match)
Below I compare **paper betas** to your **`beta_std`** (since that’s the only comparable column). Because your rows are unnamed, I can only compare patterns, but there are still clear mismatches.

#### Model 1 (paper) key benchmarks
Paper (standardized):
- Racism **+0.130**  
- Education **-0.175**  
- Age **+0.163**  
- Black **-0.132**  
Others are smaller

Generated ModelA `beta_std` includes:
- +0.139 (could be racism; close-ish)
- **-0.261** (much larger magnitude than education in paper: -0.175)
- Age-looking positive is **+0.191** (bigger than +0.163)
- A negative around **-0.127** (could be Black; close-ish), but your **p=.025** whereas paper has *** (p<.001)

**Fix**
- Once N and coding match, re-check standardized betas. If education is coming out far more negative (-.26 vs -.175), that typically indicates:
  - different sample composition,
  - different education coding (years vs degree categories),
  - or different weighting.

#### Model 2 (paper) key benchmarks
Paper (standardized):
- Racism **+0.080 (ns)**  
- Education **-0.242***  
- Age **+0.126**  
- Southern **+0.069**  
- Black **+0.042 (ns)**

Generated ModelB `beta_std` shows:
- first term **-0.005** (if that’s racism, sign is wrong and magnitude way off vs +0.080)
- education-like negative is **-0.224** (closer to -0.242, OK-ish)
- age-like is only **+0.091** (smaller than +0.126)
- you have several *positive* standardized betas around **+0.132** and **+0.142** with significance that don’t correspond to the paper’s modest religion/region effects.

**Fix**
- Ensure racism scale is coded in the same direction as Bryson (higher = more racist). A sign flip (or near-zero) often comes from:
  - reverse-coding mistakes,
  - using a different racism index,
  - standardizing before/after reversing inconsistently.

---

### 7) Constant/intercept mismatch (strong evidence DV scaling differs)
**True constants:** Model1 **2.415**, Model2 **7.860**  
**Generated constants (unstandardized):** ModelA **2.654**, ModelB **5.674**

Model 1 is somewhat close; Model 2 is not.

**Fix**
- Verify Model 2 DV is truly “number of the 12 remaining genres disliked” and that:
  - the set contains **12 items**,
  - the “dislike” coding matches,
  - DK/NA handling matches (often crucial),
  - you didn’t rescale (e.g., mean score instead of count).

---

### 8) R² mismatch (another sign of non-replication)
**True:** Model1 R²=.145 (Adj .129); Model2 R²=.147 (Adj .130)  
**Generated:** ModelA R²=.190 (Adj .164); ModelB R²=.166 (Adj .138)

These aren’t wildly impossible, but combined with the big N drop and predictor omissions, they indicate you’re not estimating the same model.

**Fix**
- After restoring N and predictors, R² should move toward the paper’s.
- Make sure you are using **OLS** on the same DV and not inadvertently using different estimation (robust SEs don’t change R², but different DV construction does).

---

### 9) Standard errors: you can’t “match” them to Table 2
You were asked to check SE mismatches, but the “true results” explicitly state **SEs are not in the table**. So any SE comparison is impossible.

**Fix**
- Remove SE comparisons entirely against Table 2.
- If you want SEs, you must compute them from the replication dataset and then you are no longer “matching the table”; you’re producing an augmented replication output.

## Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2
1. **Use the correct dataset/year and population:** GSS 1993; no unintended subgroup filters.
2. **Rebuild DVs exactly:** count of disliked genres for the specified sets (6 and 12). Match treatment of missing/DK.
3. **Recode predictors to match Bryson:**
   - Racism scale direction and composition identical
   - Education, income per capita, prestige scales consistent
   - Female 0/1
   - Race dummies (Black/Hispanic/Other; White reference)
   - Religion dummies (Conservative Protestant, No religion; correct reference)
   - Southern dummy
4. **Restore all predictors (k=12)** and prevent erroneous dropping of `no_religion`.
5. **Replicate Table 2’s output format:** standardized betas + stars only; do not claim SEs come from the paper.
6. **Check N after listwise deletion:** you should land at **644** and **605** (or extremely close if the replication file differs slightly); if not, print a missingness table to find the culprit variable.

If you paste the generated tables again **with the row variable names shown**, I can map each mismatch row-by-row (e.g., “your row 7 is supposed to be Black but has the wrong sign/magnitude”).
