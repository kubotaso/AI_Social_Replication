Score: 20/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable-name / coding mismatches

#### A. Race/ethnicity variables don’t match the table’s constructs
- **Mismatch (name + construction):**
  - Generated uses **“Black (RACE==2)”**, **“Other race (RACE==3)”**, and **“Hispanic (best-effort from ETHNIC; 20–29 if present, else missing)”**.
  - True table variables are **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race** as *substantive categories* (with White as reference), not “best-effort” proxies.
- **Why it matters:** Your Hispanic variable is explicitly “best-effort” and potentially missing for many cases; that will change coefficients and N and can even flip signs via different composition.
- **Fix:**
  - Recreate *exactly* Bryson’s race/ethnicity dummies from the same source variables/coding used in the paper (likely GSS-style: separate race and Hispanic origin).
  - Use **mutually exclusive categories** consistent with the table:  
    - `black=1 if Black else 0`  
    - `hispanic=1 if Hispanic else 0`  
    - `other_race=1 if not white/black/hispanic else 0`  
    - White omitted reference.
  - Do **not** use “20–29 if present” as a rule; instead map the actual codes to Hispanic origin as defined in that dataset/year.

#### B. Religion variable “No religion” was dropped, but it exists in the true table
- **Mismatch:**
  - Generated: **No religion (RELIG==4)** is **NaN / dropped (no variation)** in both models.
  - True: **No religion** is included with coefficients **0.057 (Model 1)** and **0.024 (Model 2)**.
- **Fix:**
  - This “no variation” indicates you filtered to a subsample where `RELIG==4` never occurs (or you recoded incorrectly).
  - Use the correct coding for “no religion” and confirm it has nonzero frequency **after** all cleaning steps.
  - If your analytic sample is small (see N mismatch below), you may simply have lost all “no religion” cases—meaning your sample definition is not the paper’s.

#### C. “Conservative Protestant” proxy likely not the paper’s definition
- **Mismatch (definition):**
  - Generated: **“Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”**.
  - True: **Conservative Protestant** (no “proxy” language).
- **Fix:**
  - Implement the paper’s actual conservative Protestant classification (often a denomination-based family coding, not a single `RELIG==1 & DENOM==1` conjunction).
  - Use the same scheme Bryson used (e.g., Steensland RELTRAD-style groupings or the specific GSS denominational classification available at the time).

#### D. Region “Southern” coding may not match
- **Mismatch risk:**
  - Generated: **Southern (REGION==3)**.
  - True: **Southern** (standard Census South).
- **Fix:**
  - Verify `REGION==3` truly corresponds to “South” in that dataset/year and that Bryson used the same region variable (sometimes `REGION` vs `SRCBELT`/`REG16` style differences).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I list **every coefficient difference** between generated and true.

#### Model 1 (DV = “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin Music”)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Racism score | 0.140 | 0.130 | +0.010 (and sig differs) |
| Education | -0.260 | -0.175 | **too negative by -0.085** |
| Income pc | -0.012 | -0.037 | too close to 0 (+0.025) |
| Occ prestige | 0.058 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** (+0.078) |
| Female | -0.034 | -0.057 | smaller magnitude (+0.023) |
| Age | 0.175 | 0.163 | +0.012 |
| Black | -0.177 | -0.132 | more negative (-0.045) |
| Hispanic | -0.007 | -0.058 | far too close to 0 (+0.051) |
| Other race | -0.005 | -0.017 | too close to 0 (+0.012) |
| Cons Protestant | 0.120 | 0.063 | too large (+0.057) |
| No religion | dropped | 0.057 | **missing** |
| Southern | -0.059 | 0.024 | **wrong sign** (-0.083) |

**How to fix Model 1 coefficients to match:**
- You cannot “tune” these to match; the pattern (sign flips + big magnitude shifts) strongly indicates **different sample + different variable construction + possibly different DV construction**.
- Required fixes:
  1. Rebuild the **DV** exactly as Bryson did (which genres, what constitutes “dislike,” and how missing is handled).
  2. Use the **same analytic sample** definition (see N mismatch).
  3. Use the **same dummy codings** for race/ethnicity, religion, and region.
  4. Standardize coefficients the same way (standardized OLS betas).

#### Model 2 (DV = “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”)

| Variable | Generated β | True β | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Racism score | -0.013 | 0.080 | **wrong sign** (-0.093) |
| Education | -0.165 | -0.242 | **not negative enough** (+0.077) |
| Income pc | -0.077 | -0.065 | slightly too negative (-0.012) |
| Occ prestige | -0.079 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** (-0.084) |
| Female | -0.082 | -0.070 | slightly too negative (-0.012) |
| Age | 0.127 | 0.126 | essentially matches (+0.001) |
| Black | 0.039 | 0.042 | essentially matches (-0.003) |
| Hispanic | -0.023 | -0.029 | small difference (+0.006) |
| Other race | 0.122 | 0.047 | too large (+0.075) |
| Cons Protestant | 0.142 | 0.048 | **too large** (+0.094) |
| No religion | dropped | 0.024 | **missing** |
| Southern | 0.104 | 0.069 | too large (+0.035) |

**How to fix Model 2 coefficients to match:**
- Biggest red flags are **racism sign**, **occupational prestige sign**, and **very inflated** conservative Protestant / other race.
- Those typically come from **(a) sample mismatch**, **(b) miscoding of those predictors**, or **(c) DV mismatch**.
- Apply the same four fixes as Model 1 (DV, sample, coding, standardization).

### 3) Significance/interpretation mismatches

#### A. Significance markers don’t match the paper
The true table’s significance (as printed):

- **Model 1:** Racism ** (p<.01), Education ***, Age ***, Black ***, others not starred.
- **Model 2:** Education ***, Age **, others not starred.

Generated significance differs:
- **Model 1:** Racism only `*` (should be `**`), Age `**` (should be `***`), Black `*` (should be `***`), and Conservative Protestant has no star (true: none; ok).
- **Model 2:** Education is only `*` (should be `***`), Other race has `*` (true: none), Conservative Protestant has `*` (true: none), Age `*` (true: `**`).

**Fix:**
- Once the coefficients/sample match, compute p-values using OLS t-tests and apply the **same thresholds**.
- But note: Bryson’s stars reflect *his* SEs from *his* sample. You will not reproduce the same stars unless you reproduce the **same N, sample design**, and likely **weighting**.

#### B. Generated output mentions standard errors / tables but the true table has no SEs
- **Mismatch:** Your instruction asks to compare SEs, but your “Generated Results” don’t report SEs either; the “True Results” explicitly says no SEs are reported.
- **Fix:**
  - If the goal is to match Bryson Table 2, **omit SEs entirely** and present only standardized coefficients + stars.
  - If you still want SEs for transparency, clearly label them as “computed from replication data; not in Bryson (1996) Table 2.”

---

### 4) Model fit / constants / N mismatches

#### A. Sample size (N) is drastically wrong
- **Mismatch:**
  - Generated N: **261 (Model A)** and **259 (Model B)**.
  - True N: **644 (Model 1)** and **605 (Model 2)**.
- **Fix:**
  - Your pipeline is dropping ~60% of cases. Common causes:
    1. Listwise deletion due to any missing on any included variable (especially your “best-effort Hispanic” or income per capita division).
    2. Overly restrictive filters (e.g., keeping only complete cases on all 18 genres instead of allowing partial and computing counts with available items).
    3. Wrong dataset/year subset.
  - To match Bryson: replicate the paper’s missing-data rule (likely: require enough genre responses to compute each DV, then listwise delete on predictors).

#### B. R² and adjusted R² do not match
- **Mismatch:**
  - Generated R²: **0.178** vs true **0.145** (Model 1).
  - Generated R²: **0.151** vs true **0.147** (Model 2; close but still not exact).
- **Fix:**
  - Correcting N/coding will change R²; additionally, Bryson may have used **weights** (GSS weight), which changes R² and coefficients.
  - Confirm whether Table 2 uses weighted OLS and replicate that.

#### C. Constants do not match (and Model 2 constant is wildly off)
- **Mismatch:**
  - Model 1 constant: generated **2.593*** vs true **2.415***.
  - Model 2 constant: generated **5.185*** vs true **7.860** (and true constant has no stars printed).
- **Fix:**
  - Constants are sensitive to:
    - DV coding (count range, dislike threshold),
    - standardization choices (betas should not affect intercept, but DV construction does),
    - weighting and sample.
  - Rebuild DV exactly and replicate sample/weights.

---

### 5) DV construction mismatches (very likely)

Even though the DV labels look similar, the big N drop + constant mismatch suggests your DV algorithm differs.

- **Mismatch risk indicators:**
  - Your DV is “count of 6” and “count of 12,” but Bryson’s “dislike” depends on how “dislike” is defined from survey responses (e.g., “dislike” vs “neutral,” treatment of “never heard,” and missing).
- **Fix:**
  - Use Bryson’s exact rule: which response categories count as “dislike,” and how “don’t know/never heard” are treated.
  - Ensure the 6 “minority-liked” genres are exactly the same as in the paper and that the remaining set is exactly 12.

---

### 6) Interpretation mismatch (direction of racism effect in Model 2)

- **Mismatch:**
  - True Model 2 racism β = **+0.080** (positive association).
  - Generated Model B racism β = **-0.013** (slightly negative).
- **Fix:**
  - This is not a rounding issue; it indicates you are not reproducing the same model/data.
  - After fixing DV/sample/coding/weights, the sign should align. If it still doesn’t:
    - verify you did not reverse-code racism (e.g., higher = less racist),
    - verify standardization (shouldn’t flip sign),
    - verify you didn’t inadvertently partial out with a different set of controls.

---

## Summary: what you must change so the generated analysis matches Bryson (1996) Table 2

1. **Use the same dataset and year(s)** Bryson used and the same inclusion criteria.
2. **Reconstruct both DVs exactly** (definition of “dislike,” handling of “never heard/DK,” and which genres go into each count).
3. **Recreate predictors with the same definitions** (especially Hispanic, other race, conservative Protestant, no religion).
4. **Match the analytic sample sizes** (644 and 605). Your current N (~260) guarantees coefficient and star mismatches.
5. **Apply the same estimation details** (OLS with standardized coefficients; and very likely the same survey weights).
6. **Only then** compute and display coefficients and stars; do not claim SE matching because the paper doesn’t report SEs.

If you share the code (or at least: DV recode rules, missing-data rules, and how you compute Hispanic/cons prot/no religion), I can point to the exact lines that are causing the N collapse and the sign flips.
