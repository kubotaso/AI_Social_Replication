Score: 18/100
============================================================

### 1) Variable name mismatches / coding inconsistencies

**1.1 “Southern” vs “south”**
- **Generated:** `Southern` in model tables; missingness table uses `south`.
- **True:** Variable is **Southern**.
- **Fix:** Use one name consistently end-to-end (e.g., rename `south` → `Southern` before modeling, or label it “Southern” in outputs).

**1.2 Race labels**
- **Generated:** `Other race`; missingness uses `other_race`.
- **True:** **Other race**.
- **Fix:** Standardize naming (either snake_case everywhere or table labels everywhere). This is cosmetic but should not change coefficients if the underlying variable is the same.

**1.3 Religion labels**
- **Generated:** `Conservative Protestant`, `No religion` appears but coefficient is `NaN`.
- **True:** Both **Conservative Protestant** and **No religion** have non-missing coefficients.
- **Fix:** This is not just labeling—your model output indicates `No religion` was dropped/not estimated. See §3.1.

**1.4 DV names differ (but can be mapped)**
- **Generated DVs:** `dislike_6_minority_associated` and `dislike_12_remaining` (also “Table2_Model1_dislike_minority_associated6”, “Table2_Model2_dislike_other12”).
- **True DVs:** “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music” and “Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres”.
- **Fix:** Rename outputs to match the paper’s wording. The bigger issue is that your coefficients/N do not match, suggesting the constructed DVs or sample differ (see §2 and §4).

### 2) Coefficient mismatches (generated vs true)

Below, **every row where the coefficient differs** (including sign changes).

#### Model 1 (6 “minority-associated” genres)

| Variable | Generated beta_std | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.1109 | 0.130 | value differs (true larger) |
| Education | -0.2260 (**)| -0.175 (***) | magnitude + stars differ |
| Household income pc | -0.0073 | -0.037 | value differs |
| Occupational prestige | 0.0788 | -0.020 | **sign flip** |
| Female | -0.0174 | -0.057 | value differs |
| Age | 0.0719 | 0.163 (***) | value differs (true much larger) |
| Black | -0.1799 | -0.132 (***) | value differs + stars differ |
| Hispanic | -0.0046 | -0.058 | value differs |
| Other race | 0.0043 | -0.017 | **sign flip** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.0760 | 0.063 | small difference |
| No religion | NaN | 0.057 | **missing estimate** |
| Southern | 0.0169 | 0.024 | small difference |
| Constant | 2.5273 (***) | 2.415 (***) | value differs |

#### Model 2 (12 remaining genres)

| Variable | Generated beta_std | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.0367 | 0.080 | **sign flip** |
| Education | -0.2414 (***) | -0.242 (***) | essentially matches (ok) |
| Household income pc | -0.0441 | -0.065 | value differs |
| Occupational prestige | -0.0463 | 0.005 | **sign flip** |
| Female | -0.0630 | -0.070 | small difference |
| Age | 0.0249 | 0.126 (**) | value differs greatly + stars differ |
| Black | 0.0628 | 0.042 | value differs |
| Hispanic | -0.1064 | -0.029 | value differs greatly |
| Other race | 0.0649 | 0.047 | value differs |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.1718 (**) | 0.048 | value differs greatly + stars differ |
| No religion | NaN | 0.024 | **missing estimate** |
| Southern | 0.1145 (*) | 0.069 | value differs + stars differ |
| Constant | 6.066 (***) | 7.860 (no stars shown in paper) | value differs a lot |

**Interpretation mismatch implied by sign flips:** Your generated Model 2 implies racism is (slightly) *negatively* associated with disliking the 12 remaining genres, while the true table shows a *positive* association (0.080). That’s a substantive contradiction, not a rounding issue.

---

### 3) Standard errors: generated output violates what the “true” table contains

- **True:** Table 2 **does not report standard errors at all**; only standardized coefficients and stars.
- **Generated:** You did not show SEs in the model tables, but your prompt asks to compare them. Since the true table has **no SEs**, any SE comparison is impossible and any SEs you might have generated elsewhere would not be “matching Table 2.”

**Fix:**  
- Remove any claim that SEs come from Table 2.
- If you want SEs, you must compute them from the microdata model you fit (and then be clear they are *your computed SEs*, not extracted from the paper).

---

### 4) Fit statistics and sample size mismatches (major)

**4.1 N is wrong in both models**
- **Generated:** N = 283 for both models.
- **True:** N = 644 (Model 1) and N = 605 (Model 2).

This alone guarantees coefficients, R², and significance won’t match.

**Fix:**
- Replicate the paper’s **sample restrictions** and **missing-data handling**. Your missingness table shows large missingness on `racism_score` (765 missing out of 1606), but that still wouldn’t naturally yield exactly N=283 for both unless additional filters/drops happened.
- Ensure you are using **GSS 1993** and the same universe (and any exclusions Bryson used).
- Apply the same listwise deletion rule per model (since Model 1 and Model 2 have different Ns in the paper, the DV construction or missingness differs across the two DVs).

**4.2 R² and adjusted R² are wrong**
- **Generated:** R² ≈ .121 / .133; adj R² ≈ .086 / .098.
- **True:** R² = .145 / .147; adj R² = .129 / .130.

**Fix:** Once N, DV construction, weights, and standardization match the paper, R² should move closer. If it still doesn’t:
- verify you are running **OLS on the count of genres disliked** (as in the title);
- verify the genre sets are exactly as described (see §5);
- verify any **weights** (GSS weights) and design decisions in Bryson’s analysis.

---

### 5) DV construction likely does not match (driving many coefficient gaps)

Your DVs are named as if they’re counts, but the pattern of coefficients (especially sign flips for racism and prestige, and the much smaller age effects) is consistent with **not replicating the same dependent variables** and/or **not standardizing the same way**.

**True Model 1 DV:** number of dislikes among exactly: **Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin**.  
**True Model 2 DV:** number of dislikes among the **other 12 genres** (i.e., 18 total genres in Bryson’s setup).

**Fix checklist:**
1. Confirm the **exact 18 genre items** in GSS 1993 used by Bryson.
2. Code each genre as “disliked” using the **same threshold** Bryson used (e.g., “dislike” vs “neutral/like”). If you used a different cutpoint, counts change.
3. Compute DV1 = sum(dislike indicators for the 6 specified genres).
4. Compute DV2 = sum(dislike indicators for the remaining 12.
5. Check descriptive means against the paper (your means: 1.90 and 3.53; these might or might not align—without the paper’s descriptives we can’t confirm, but mismatch is plausible).

---

### 6) “No religion” being NaN (dropped) is a concrete model-specification error

- **Generated:** `No religion = NaN` in both models.
- **True:** `No religion` has coefficients (0.057 in Model 1; 0.024 in Model 2).

This usually happens when:
- the variable is perfectly collinear with other religion dummies (e.g., you included a full set of religion categories plus an intercept), or
- `no_religion` is all missing/constant in the estimation sample (unlikely given missingness table shows only 9 missing and mean ~0.091).

**Fix:**
- If you are using dummy variables for religion, include **k−1** dummies with a reference category (e.g., omit “Mainline Protestant” or similar), **not** all categories plus intercept.
- If you only intend two indicators (Conservative Protestant, No religion) with the omitted group being “all others,” that’s fine—but verify that “No religion” is coded independently and not deterministically implied by the other religion coding in your dataset.

---

### 7) Standardization / “beta_std” may not match Bryson’s standardized coefficients

Even if you standardize, there are multiple ways this goes wrong:
- standardizing with a different estimation sample (because your N differs),
- standardizing binary variables differently (still standardizable, but must be done consistently),
- using unstandardized DV but standardized predictors (or vice versa),
- using post-estimation “standardized betas” from a package that does not match the paper’s approach.

**Fix:**
- Use the **same sample for standardization** as the regression sample (listwise deleted sample per model).
- Standardize **both DV and all predictors** (typical beta computation), then run OLS; coefficients equal standardized betas.
- Alternatively compute betas as \( b \times sd(X)/sd(Y)\) using the same sample.

---

### 8) Significance stars mismatch (interpretation consequences)

Given the paper’s stars are based on its N (~600), your N=283 will change p-values a lot. Also some of your stars differ even where coefficients are somewhat close.

**Fix:**
- Do not expect stars to match until N and the exact model replicate.
- Once replicated, apply the paper’s thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001 two-tailed).

---

## What to change so the generated analysis matches the true Table 2

1. **Use the correct dataset/year and sample** (GSS 1993; apply Bryson’s inclusion rules).
2. **Rebuild both DVs exactly** (6 specified genres vs the other 12; same dislike coding threshold).
3. **Handle missing data the same way** (listwise deletion per model; expect different N across models).
4. **Fix religion dummy coding** so **No religion is estimable** (avoid dummy trap/collinearity).
5. **Compute standardized coefficients the same way** (standardize on the estimation sample).
6. **Report only what Table 2 reports**: standardized coefficients + stars; do not claim SEs come from Table 2.
7. **Align variable names in the output** (Southern/south, other_race/Other race, etc.) to avoid presentation mismatches.

If you share your exact model formula(s), how you coded “dislike,” and what filters produced N=283, I can pinpoint exactly which step is causing the sign flips (especially for racism, prestige, and age).
