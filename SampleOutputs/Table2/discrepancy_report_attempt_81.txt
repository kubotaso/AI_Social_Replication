Score: 18/100
============================================================

## 1) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### A. **Hispanic is missing in the generated models**
- **True Table 2:** includes **Hispanic** in *both* Model 1 and Model 2.
  - Model 1: Hispanic = **-0.058** (ns)
  - Model 2: Hispanic = **-0.029** (ns)
- **Generated results:** no “Hispanic” row anywhere (combined table, model tables, or analytic samples).

**Fix**
- Add the Hispanic indicator to both model specifications and tables.
  - If your dataset has a `hispanic` dummy, include it.
  - If ethnicity is encoded differently (e.g., `race` categories), create **mutually exclusive race/ethnicity dummies** with the same reference group as Bryson (typically White, non-Hispanic), e.g.:
  - `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` (with White as omitted category).
- Also ensure your “Other race” is defined the same way Bryson defines it (i.e., not including Hispanic).

---

### B. **“Other race” sign differs in Model 1**
- **True Model 1:** Other race = **-0.017**
- **Generated Model 1:** Other race = **+0.010867**

**Fix**
- This is likely because your race dummy coding doesn’t match the paper’s:
  - You may be using “Other race” as *non-White including Hispanic*, while Bryson separates Hispanic.
- Once you add Hispanic separately and redefine other_race as “non-White, non-Black, non-Hispanic,” the coefficient direction may align.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (by model and variable)

### Model 1 (Minority-linked genres: 6)

| Variable | True coef | Generated coef | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.131833** | close (rounding only) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.180139*** | slightly off |
| Household income per capita | -0.037 | +0.008961 | **wrong sign + magnitude** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.020 | -0.019019 | close |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.071658 | off |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.156851*** | off |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.141030** | **sig level differs** (*** vs **) and magnitude off |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | **missing** | **missing variable** |
| Other race | -0.017 | +0.010867 | **wrong sign** |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.063 | 0.083766 | off |
| No religion | 0.057 | 0.068263 | off |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.026711 | close |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.461148*** | off |

**Fixes**
1. **Standardization must match the paper.** Bryson reports *standardized OLS coefficients* (betas). Your values look like betas, but not identical—suggesting:
   - different sample,
   - different standardization method,
   - different handling of weights/missing data,
   - or different coding of variables (especially income, race/ethnicity).
2. **Income sign flip is the biggest red flag.** Common causes:
   - income scaled differently (log vs raw, or reversed),
   - income_per_capita computed differently than Bryson,
   - sample differences (your N=549 vs true N=644),
   - weights not applied (GSS often uses weights; Bryson may have).
3. **Fix race/ethnicity coding** as noted (add Hispanic; redefine other_race).
4. **Replicate sample construction** (see Section 4).

### Model 2 (Remaining genres: 12)

| Variable | True coef | Generated coef | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.002233 | **wrong sign and near zero** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.194316*** | **too small in magnitude** |
| Household income per capita | -0.065 | -0.035654 | magnitude too small |
| Occupational prestige | 0.005 | -0.012431 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.069205 | close |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.119317** | close-ish |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.066914 | off |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | **missing** | **missing variable** |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.076128 | off |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.048 | 0.101269* | **too large + wrong sig** |
| No religion | 0.024 | 0.018895 | close-ish |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.075385 | close-ish |
| Constant | 7.860 | 4.957739*** | **completely different** |

**Fixes**
- The **racism score** discrepancy (0.080 vs ~0) strongly indicates you are not estimating the same model/data definition. This is not a rounding issue.
- The **constant** is also a major sign you are not matching:
  - Bryson’s constant for Model 2 is **7.860** and *not* starred in the reproduction you pasted (and in the paper Table 2, constants are not always emphasized the same way). Your constant is **4.958***.
  - Constants are sensitive to DV scale and sample composition; your DV/sample likely differs.

## 3) Standard errors: a required “mismatch” in reporting

- **True Table 2:** *does not report standard errors*.
- **Generated results request:** “Identify mismatch in … standard errors.”
- **Generated output shown:** contains no SEs either—only coefficients and significance stars.

So:
- There is **no SE mismatch to check** because SEs are absent in both the true table and the generated output you provided.
- However, there **is** an *interpretation/reporting mismatch risk*: your stars imply you computed p-values/t-tests, which Table 2 *does* show via stars, but without SEs.

**Fix**
- If you want to mirror Bryson exactly: report **betas + stars only**, no SEs.
- If your pipeline requires SEs: you can compute them, but then your output will no longer match Table 2’s format; add a note “SEs computed; not shown in Bryson Table 2.”

---

## 4) Fit-statistics and sample-size mismatches (major)

### Sample size (N)
- **True:** Model 1 N=**644**; Model 2 N=**605**
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=**549**; Model 2 N=**507**

That’s a large loss of cases.

**Fix**
- You must reproduce Bryson’s inclusion rules:
  - same survey year(s) / dataset release,
  - same age restrictions (if any),
  - same handling of missing data (likely listwise deletion but on *exactly the same variables*),
  - same construction of DV counts,
  - same exclusion of “don’t know / not asked” responses on genre items.
- Your analytic sample tables show many complete covariates, so the loss is likely from:
  - genre-item missingness in DV construction,
  - or missing on racism score / income / prestige / religion.
- To match: build DVs and covariates exactly as in Bryson and then apply **listwise deletion on the union of DV + all IVs used in that model**.

### R² / Adjusted R²
- **True:** Model 1 R²=**0.145**, Adj=**0.129**; Model 2 R²=**0.147**, Adj=**0.130**
- **Generated:** Model 1 R²=**0.133**, Adj=**0.115**; Model 2 R²=**0.120**, Adj=**0.100**

**Fix**
- R² will not match until:
  1) N matches closely, and  
  2) DV construction matches, and  
  3) weights/standardization match.

---

## 5) Interpretation mismatches (what your generated tables implicitly claim)

### A. Model 2 racism effect
- **True interpretation:** Racism score has a **positive** (though not significant) association with dislike of remaining genres (**0.080**).
- **Generated interpretation implied by coefficient:** essentially **no relationship** or slightly negative (**-0.002**).

**Fix**
- Once you fix DV definition, sample, and (especially) whether the racism scale is coded and standardized the same way, this should move. If it does not, you are still not replicating Bryson’s measurement.

### B. Conservative Protestant in Model 2
- **True:** 0.048 (ns)
- **Generated:** 0.101* (significant)

**Fix**
- Check:
  - how “Conservative Protestant” is classified (denomination mapping),
  - whether mainline/evangelical coding follows Bryson’s schema,
  - whether you accidentally coded a broader “Protestant” or “fundamentalist” variable.

## 6) Practical checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1. **Use the same DV construction**
   - DV1: count of dislikes among exactly: Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin music.
   - DV2: count of dislikes among the other 12 genres (must match Bryson’s genre list exactly).
   - Ensure “dislike” threshold matches Bryson’s coding (e.g., dislike vs like/neutral; how “never heard” is treated).

2. **Recreate covariates exactly**
   - Racism scale: same items, same direction, same range, same handling of missing, same standardization.
   - Education: years or categories? (Bryson uses “Education” but you must match its operationalization.)
   - Income per capita: must match Bryson’s definition; your values look like dollar amounts—confirm Bryson’s transformation.
   - Occupational prestige: same prestige scale and year conversion.
   - Race/ethnicity: include **Black, Hispanic, Other race** with correct reference group.
   - Conservative Protestant: same classification scheme.
   - No religion and Southern: confirm coding.

3. **Apply the same sample restrictions and missing-data handling**
   - Match N (644 / 605). If you cannot, document exactly why (different data release, missing variables, etc.).

4. **Apply weights if Bryson did**
   - If Bryson used survey weights and you didn’t (or vice versa), coefficients and R² will differ.

5. **Compute and report standardized coefficients the same way**
   - Standardize using the analysis sample for that model (not the full dataset).
   - Use OLS with standardized X and Y (or compute betas from unstandardized b’s); but do it consistently with the approach that reproduces the table.

If you paste your exact variable construction code (especially DV coding, racism scale coding, income per capita derivation, and race/ethnicity dummies), I can point to the specific lines that are producing the sign flips and N loss.
