Score: 27/100
============================================================

### 1) Global mismatches (the whole output is not the same estimand)

#### 1.1 Wrong sample size (N) in both models
- **Generated:** Model A N=261; Model B N=259 (and DV descriptives show N=1134 / 1057 overall, then huge drop to ~260).
- **True (Bryson Table 2):** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605.
- **Why this is a mismatch:** Even if you used the same variables, different listwise deletion rules, filters, year selection, or missing-value handling will change coefficients and significance.
- **Fix:** Reproduce Bryson’s analytic sample construction.
  - Use the same survey/year as the paper (your output says “All 1993”; confirm that matches Bryson 1996 Table 2’s data year).
  - Apply the same eligibility rules (e.g., adults only, valid responses on genre items, valid covariates).
  - Implement **listwise deletion exactly over the variables in the model**, but do not accidentally drop cases due to miscoded “missing” values (see 1.3).
  - Verify final N’s match **644** and **605** before comparing coefficients.

#### 1.2 Wrong dependent-variable construction / scale is inconsistent with the constant
- **Generated constants:** 2.594 (Model A) and 5.186 (Model B).
- **True constants:** 2.415 (Model 1) and **7.860** (Model 2).
- **Why this is a mismatch:** Intercepts shift when the DV is built differently (different genre set, coding of “dislike,” handling of “don’t know,” rescaling, or using counts 0–12 vs something else).
- **Fix:** Recreate DV coding exactly as Bryson:
  - Confirm the **exact 6 “minority-linked” genres** and the **exact 12 remaining genres** match the questionnaire categories used in the paper (names vary across surveys).
  - Confirm how “dislike” is defined (e.g., “dislike” vs “don’t like,” whether neutral counts, whether “never heard” is excluded vs treated as missing vs treated as dislike).
  - Confirm the DV is a **count** as described in the paper (0–6 and 0–12) and that missing genre responses are handled the same way (often: require nonmissing for each item used in the count).

#### 1.3 “No religion” incorrectly dropped for “no variation”
- **Generated:** “No religion (RELIG==4)” is **dropped (no variation)** in both models.
- **True:** “No religion” is included with coefficients **0.057** (Model 1) and **0.024** (Model 2).
- **Why this is a mismatch:** In a national sample, “no religion” should vary. This indicates a **coding/filtering error** (e.g., you restricted to a subset where RELIG is constant, recoded missing to 4, or used wrong variable/value labels).
- **Fix:**
  - Check the religion variable coding in the specific dataset/year Bryson used.
  - Do not hardcode `RELIG==4` as “none” without verifying labels.
  - Ensure missing values aren’t recoded into the “no religion” category (or vice versa).
  - After recode, run a frequency table; confirm both 0 and 1 exist for `no_religion`.

#### 1.4 Variable definitions don’t match the paper (several proxies/heuristics)
- **Generated labels include:**  
  - “Hispanic (from ETHNIC; extract-limited heuristic)”  
  - “Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM==1)”  
  - “Southern (REGION==3 per mapping)”
- **True table uses:** Hispanic, Conservative Protestant, Southern—without “proxy/heuristic.”
- **Why mismatch matters:** Using “heuristics” strongly suggests you did not use Bryson’s exact recodes; that will change coefficients and significance.
- **Fix:** Implement the paper’s exact coding rules (or appendix/codebook rules) for:
  - Hispanic ethnicity
  - Conservative Protestant identification
  - South region definition
  - Race categories (and reference group)

### 2) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below, “Generated” refers to ModelA_Std_Beta / ModelB_Std_Beta; “True” refers to Bryson Table 2.

#### Model 1 (true) vs Generated Model A

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.141* | 0.130** | value off; **sig level wrong** |
| Education | -0.259*** | -0.175*** | **too large in magnitude** |
| Income pc | -0.0126 | -0.037 | wrong value (too close to 0) |
| Occ prestige | 0.0575 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.0344 | -0.057 | wrong value |
| Age | 0.1749** | 0.163*** | value slightly off; **sig wrong** |
| Black | -0.1776* | -0.132*** | value off; **sig wrong** |
| Hispanic | -0.0054 | -0.058 | far off (near 0 vs moderate negative) |
| Other race | -0.0057 | -0.017 | off |
| Cons Protestant | 0.1212 | 0.063 | about 2× too large |
| No religion | dropped | 0.057 | **omitted variable** |
| Southern | -0.0598 | 0.024 | **wrong sign** |
| Constant | 2.594*** | 2.415*** | wrong value |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.178 / 0.142 | 0.145 / 0.129 | wrong fit stats |
| N | 261 | 644 | wrong sample size |

**How to fix to match Model 1:**
1. Recreate **N=644** analytic sample and include **No religion** properly.
2. Fix region coding so “Southern” matches the paper (your sign flip is a red flag that REGION mapping is wrong or reference is wrong).
3. Fix occupational prestige variable (PRESTG80 may not be the same prestige scale Bryson used, or you’re using the wrong year/variable; also may require excluding missing codes).
4. Fix Hispanic and Conservative Protestant recodes (heuristics likely wrong).
5. After those, rerun standardized OLS; check betas and stars.

#### Model 2 (true) vs Generated Model B

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.0085 | 0.080 | **wrong sign and far off** |
| Education | -0.165* | -0.242*** | magnitude too small; sig wrong |
| Income pc | -0.0789 | -0.065 | modest difference |
| Occ prestige | -0.0827 | 0.005 | **wrong sign, far off** |
| Female | -0.0832 | -0.070 | modest difference |
| Age | 0.1247 (ns) | 0.126** | sig wrong (should be **) |
| Black | 0.0431 | 0.042 | essentially matches |
| Hispanic | 0.0076 | -0.029 | **wrong sign** |
| Other race | 0.1243* | 0.047 | too large; sig wrong |
| Cons Protestant | 0.1420* | 0.048 | too large; sig wrong |
| No religion | dropped | 0.024 | **omitted variable** |
| Southern | 0.1005 | 0.069 | somewhat high |
| Constant | 5.186*** | 7.860 | **wrong intercept and significance formatting** |
| R² / Adj R² | 0.151 / 0.113 | 0.147 / 0.130 | Adj R² wrong direction |
| N | 259 | 605 | wrong sample size |

**How to fix to match Model 2:**
1. The biggest red flag is **racism score**: true is positive (0.080), generated is ~0 and negative. That almost certainly means at least one of:
   - racism scale constructed differently (items, direction, missing handling, requirement “strict 5/5 items” likely not what Bryson did),
   - wrong dataset/year,
   - wrong DV construction for the “12 remaining genres,”
   - heavy selection causing suppression/sign change.
2. Fix prestige, Hispanic, Conservative Protestant coding (wrong sign and inflated sizes are consistent with miscoding).
3. Fix “No religion” inclusion.
4. Rebuild the DV so the intercept aligns (7.860 in the paper—your DV mean/scale likely differs).

### 3) Standard errors: mismatch in *reporting* (and what you should do)
- **Generated output:** provides no SEs, only standardized betas and significance stars. (So there are no SE mismatches to enumerate.)
- **True table:** explicitly notes **no SEs are reported**.
- **But there is still an interpretation mismatch:** your stars do not match the paper’s stars for many coefficients. That means your p-values (and thus implied SE/t) don’t match—even though SEs aren’t displayed.
- **Fix:** Don’t try to “match SEs”; instead:
  - match the **sample**, **coding**, and **DV**, then recompute OLS and confirm that the resulting p-values reproduce the star pattern in Bryson.

---

### 4) Interpretation/status mismatches

#### 4.1 Misstating “dropped (no variation)” as if it were acceptable
- **Generated:** treats dropping “No religion” as a data property.
- **True:** it varies and is included.
- **Fix:** Treat this as a **fatal data-processing error**; correct it before any substantive interpretation.

#### 4.2 “Hispanic … extract-limited heuristic” and other “proxy” labels
- **Generated interpretation:** implicitly claims you matched Bryson’s constructs.
- **True:** Bryson’s constructs are substantive and likely based on standard GSS/NES recodes, not ad-hoc heuristics.
- **Fix:** Replace proxy/heuristic construction with documented recodes; then rename variables to match the paper exactly.

---

### 5) Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1. **Data source/year**: confirm you are using the exact dataset and wave Bryson used for Table 2.
2. **Recode missing values**: convert survey missing codes (e.g., 8/9/98/99) to NA before any computation.
3. **Rebuild DVs**:
   - DV1: count dislikes of the 6 specified genres.
   - DV2: count dislikes of the other 12 genres.
   - Handle “never heard/don’t know” exactly as Bryson.
4. **Rebuild IVs exactly**:
   - Racism scale: same items, same direction, same inclusion rule (your “strict 5/5 items” is likely wrong).
   - Education, income per capita, prestige: ensure correct variables and scaling.
   - Race/ethnicity: correct Hispanic definition and race categories consistent with Bryson.
   - Religion: correct Conservative Protestant and No religion coding.
   - Region: correct “Southern” definition.
5. **Match analytic N**: enforce listwise deletion only after all recodes; confirm N=644 and N=605.
6. **Run standardized OLS** and report standardized betas; then verify coefficients and stars match.

If you share the code you used to construct (a) racism_score, (b) the two DV counts, and (c) the RELIG/DENOM/REGION recodes, I can point to the exact lines that are producing each mismatch (e.g., where “no religion” loses variation or where the racism scale gets reversed).
