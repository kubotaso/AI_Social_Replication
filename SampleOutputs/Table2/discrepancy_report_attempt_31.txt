Score: 10/100
============================================================

### 1) Sample size / model fit mismatches (major)

**Mismatch: N**
- **Generated**: Model A **N=261**, Model B **N=259**
- **True (Bryson 1996 Table 2)**: Model 1 **N=644**, Model 2 **N=605**

**How to fix**
- Use the same dataset and inclusion rules as Bryson (1996) Table 2.
- Ensure you are using the full analytic sample (not a restricted subset caused by missingness, filtering, or merging).
- Apply the same listwise deletion rules Bryson used (or replicate his missing-data handling) so N matches **644** and **605**.

**Mismatch: R² and Adjusted R²**
- **Generated**: Model A **R²=0.178**, Adj **0.142**; Model B **R²=0.151**, Adj **0.113**
- **True**: Model 1 **R²=0.145**, Adj **0.129**; Model 2 **R²=0.147**, Adj **0.130**

**How to fix**
- Once N and the exact variable coding match the paper, R² should move toward the published values.
- Also confirm you are running **OLS** with the same DV construction (see DV section below) and the same set of predictors (including “No religion,” which you dropped).

**Mismatch: Constant**
- **Generated**: Model A constant **2.599***; Model B constant **5.198***  
- **True**: Model 1 constant **2.415***; Model 2 constant **7.860** (no stars shown in your transcription; Table 2 sometimes omits stars for constants)

**How to fix**
- Constants won’t match until the **DV scaling**, **sample**, and **coding** match. In particular, a big shift (Model 2 constant 5.2 vs 7.86) strongly suggests the DV was constructed/scaled differently.

---

### 2) DV definition / scaling mismatches (very likely)

**Mismatch: DV levels implied by constants**
- Model 2’s constant is dramatically different (5.2 vs 7.86). That typically indicates:
  - different number of items in the “dislike” index,
  - different response scale direction (like vs dislike),
  - rescaling/standardizing the DV,
  - or using means vs sums.

**How to fix**
- Recreate both DVs *exactly* as in Bryson (1996):
  - Model 1 DV: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music”
  - Model 2 DV: “Dislike of the 12 remaining genres”
- Verify whether Bryson used **sum indices** or **mean indices**, and whether any items were reverse-coded.
- Do **not standardize the DV** if Bryson didn’t (Table reports standardized *coefficients* but constants imply the DV itself is not standardized).

---

### 3) Predictor set / “No religion” handling (clear discrepancy)

**Mismatch: “No religion” dropped**
- **Generated**: “No religion” = **NaN**, and `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion`
- **True**: “No religion” is included with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**

**How to fix**
- “Dropped_no_variation” means your model matrix treated “No religion” as having no variation—this is almost certainly a **coding error** or a **sample restriction** problem.
  - Check frequency: `table(no_religion)` in the analytic sample.
  - Ensure it’s coded 0/1 and not all 0 or all missing after filtering.
  - If using religion dummies, ensure you didn’t accidentally make “No religion” the reference category *and* also include it as a predictor (dummy-variable trap handling differs by software). Bryson’s table clearly treats “No religion” as a separate indicator relative to an omitted category.

---

### 4) Variable-name/meaning mismatches (sign reversals suggest coding problems)

Several coefficients have **opposite signs** compared to the published table—this is not random noise; it usually indicates **reverse coding**, **different reference categories**, or **different DV direction**.

#### Racism score
- **Generated**: Model A **0.144***; Model B **−0.009**  
- **True**: Model 1 **0.130** (**) ; Model 2 **0.080** (ns)

**What’s wrong**
- Model B sign flips from positive (true) to slightly negative (generated). That suggests either:
  - DV2 is reversed (dislike vs like),
  - or “racism score” is reverse-coded in Model B pipeline,
  - or a mismatch in which DV was paired to which model.

**Fix**
- Verify DV2 direction and the racism scale direction are consistent across both models.
- Confirm Model A corresponds to Table 2 Model 1 and Model B to Model 2 (no swapping).

#### Southern
- **Generated**: Model A **−0.059**; Model B **+0.101**
- **True**: Model 1 **+0.024**; Model 2 **+0.069**

**What’s wrong**
- Model A sign is wrong (negative vs positive).

**Fix**
- Check coding of “Southern” (1=south vs 1=not south).
- Check whether “southern” got flipped by a recode step.

#### Occupational prestige
- **Generated**: Model A **+0.057**; Model B **−0.083**
- **True**: Model 1 **−0.020**; Model 2 **+0.005**

**What’s wrong**
- Both models diverge in sign and magnitude.

**Fix**
- Confirm you used the same prestige measure (and same scaling) as Bryson (e.g., Duncan SEI or NORC prestige score). A different prestige index (or reverse-coded prestige) would do this.

#### Hispanic
- **Generated**: Model A **+0.040**; Model B **+0.018**
- **True**: Model 1 **−0.058**; Model 2 **−0.029**

**What’s wrong**
- Both signs are wrong.

**Fix**
- Check race/ethnicity dummy coding and reference group.
- Ensure “Hispanic” is coded 1=Hispanic, 0=non-Hispanic, and that “Black/Hispanic/Other race” are mutually exclusive as in the paper.

---

### 5) Coefficient mismatches (systematic, not just rounding)

Below are variable-by-variable differences. (Generated → True)

#### Model 1 (Generated “ModelA” vs True “Model 1”)
- Racism score: **0.144*** → **0.130** (**) (magnitude + sig mismatch)
- Education: **−0.260*** → **−0.175*** (too large in magnitude)
- Income: **−0.013** → **−0.037** (too close to 0)
- Occ prestige: **+0.057** → **−0.020** (sign mismatch)
- Female: **−0.036** → **−0.057** (magnitude mismatch)
- Age: **+0.174** (**) → **+0.163*** (sig mismatch)
- Black: **−0.207** → **−0.132*** (too large in magnitude; sig mismatch—your table shows none)
- Hispanic: **+0.040** → **−0.058** (sign mismatch)
- Other race: **−0.005** → **−0.017** (mismatch)
- Cons. Protestant: **+0.117** → **+0.063** (too large)
- No religion: **dropped** → **+0.057** (should be included)
- Southern: **−0.059** → **+0.024** (sign mismatch)

#### Model 2 (Generated “ModelB” vs True “Model 2”)
- Racism score: **−0.009** → **+0.080** (sign mismatch)
- Education: **−0.165** (*) → **−0.242*** (too small; sig mismatch)
- Income: **−0.079** → **−0.065** (close-ish but not equal)
- Occ prestige: **−0.083** → **+0.005** (sign mismatch)
- Female: **−0.084** → **−0.070** (close-ish)
- Age: **+0.125** (no sig) → **+0.126** (**) (sig mismatch)
- Black: **+0.025** → **+0.042** (mismatch)
- Hispanic: **+0.018** → **−0.029** (sign mismatch)
- Other race: **+0.124** (*) → **+0.047** (too large; sig mismatch)
- Cons. Protestant: **+0.141** (*) → **+0.048** (far too large)
- No religion: **dropped** → **+0.024** (should be included)
- Southern: **+0.101** → **+0.069** (mismatch)

**How to fix (general)**
- These are too widespread to be mere sampling variability. To match Bryson, you need:
  1) exact DV construction,
  2) exact predictor construction/coding (especially race/ethnicity and region),
  3) exact sample and weights (if any were used),
  4) standardized betas computed the same way.

---

### 6) Significance/interpretation mismatches (and a conceptual error)

**Mismatch: significance stars differ**
Examples:
- True Model 1: Racism **0.130** has ** (p<.01); Generated gives only *
- True Model 1: Age is ***; Generated is **
- True Model 1: Black is ***; Generated shows no star
- True Model 2: Education is ***; Generated is only *
- True Model 2: Age is **; Generated has none

**How to fix**
- Once coefficients, N, and standard errors (implicitly) align, significance will align.
- But also: ensure you’re using **two-tailed tests** as noted in the paper and the same p-value thresholds.

**Conceptual discrepancy: “standard errors”**
- You asked to compare standard errors, but **the true table does not report SEs**.
- Your generated output also does not show SEs—only standardized betas and stars—so SE comparison is impossible.

**How to fix**
- If you want your generated analysis to “match Table 2,” don’t invent or compare SEs.
- If you want SEs anyway, compute and report them from your replication—but then you must **not** claim they come from Bryson’s Table 2.

---

### 7) Standardized beta computation mismatch (likely)

Even if you run the “right” OLS, standardized betas can differ if:
- you standardized using the wrong SD (sample vs population),
- you standardized after listwise deletion differently per model,
- you standardized categorical dummies incorrectly (some software reports “standardized” effects differently when variables are binary).

**How to fix**
- Replicate Bryson’s approach: Table 2 reports “standardized OLS coefficients” (typically meaning: run OLS on original variables and then compute beta = b * SD(X)/SD(Y) using the model sample).
- Ensure standardization uses the **same analytic sample per model**.

---

## Minimal checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996) Table 2

1) Rebuild DV1 and DV2 exactly (items, reverse-coding, sum/mean, scale direction).
2) Use the correct analytic samples (target **N=644** and **N=605**).
3) Fix “No religion” so it varies and is included (and set the correct religion reference category).
4) Verify coding directions for: **Southern**, **Hispanic**, **Occupational prestige**, **Racism score**.
5) Re-run OLS and compute standardized betas in the same way; then apply two-tailed p-values for stars.

If you paste your variable coding rules (especially for the DVs, race/ethnicity, religion, and southern) and how you computed standardized betas, I can point to the exact step causing each sign flip.
