Below is a line‑by‑line reconciliation of your **Generated Results** vs the **True Results (Bryson 1996, Table 2)**, focusing on **variable names, standardized coefficients, (nonexistent) standard errors, fit statistics, N, and interpretation/significance**—and exactly how to fix each issue so the generated analysis matches the paper.

---

## 1) What the paper reports vs what the generated output claims

### True Results (Table 2) reporting rules
- **Reports:** standardized OLS coefficients (“betas”), significance stars, **R²**, adjusted R², **N**, and **constant**.
- **Does NOT report:** **standard errors**, **t‑stats**, **p‑values**, or robust SEs.

### Generated Results
- Present “Std_Beta” and stars (good in concept), plus constants and fit.
- But it **drops a variable** (“No religion”), uses **different sample sizes**, and yields **different coefficients and R²**.

**Fix requirement:** Ensure the generated pipeline reproduces *Table 2 exactly*, which implies using the **same sample definitions, same variable coding, same standardization, and same model specification** as Bryson (1996). If you can’t reproduce the exact sample, you must not label it as Table 2 replication.

---

## 2) Variable name mismatches / variable handling problems

### A. “No religion” is incorrectly dropped (major mismatch)
- **Generated:** `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion` and `No religion = NaN` in both models.
- **True:** “No religion” is included with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**

**Why this happens:** In your analytic frame for the regression subset, `no_religion` appears to be all zeros (no variance) after listwise deletion / filtering.

**How to fix:**
1. **Check coding and filtering order**
   - If `no_religion` was created *after* filtering, or incorrectly recoded, it may have become constant.
   - Verify the raw religion variable and recode rules match Bryson’s.
2. **Check that religion categories exist in the regression sample**
   - You have extremely high missingness for key covariates (see §4). If listwise deletion removes most “no religion” respondents, the remaining subset could have none.
3. **Implement the same missing-data strategy as the paper**
   - Bryson’s N is much larger; your listwise deletion is likely not what Bryson did (or you are using a different dataset/year/weighting).
4. **Confirm “No religion” is a separate dummy from “Conservative Protestant”**
   - Ensure the reference category matches the paper (likely “other religions” / mainline / Catholic etc.). If the base category differs, coefficients shift.

## 3) Coefficient (Std Beta) mismatches: every variable, both models

Your generated standardized betas do not match Table 2. Below I list each mismatch (Generated − True).

### Model 1 (DV1: minority 6 dislikes)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Racism score | 0.153 | 0.130** | +0.023 (and stars differ) |
| Education | -0.273 | -0.175*** | -0.098 |
| Household income per capita | -0.021 | -0.037 | +0.016 |
| Occupational prestige | 0.090 | -0.020 | +0.110 (sign flips) |
| Female | -0.003 | -0.057 | +0.054 |
| Age | 0.093 | 0.163*** | -0.070 |
| Black | -0.192 | -0.132*** | -0.060 |
| Hispanic | 0.004 | -0.058 | +0.062 (sign flips) |
| Other race | 0.023 | -0.017 | +0.040 (sign flips) |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.076 | 0.063 | +0.013 |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | 0.057 | not estimated |
| Southern | -0.021 | 0.024 | -0.045 (sign flips) |

### Model 2 (DV2: remaining 12 dislikes)

| Variable | Generated beta | True beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Racism score | 0.0467 | 0.080 | -0.0333 |
| Education | -0.211 | -0.242*** | +0.031 (weaker) |
| Household income per capita | -0.047 | -0.065 | +0.018 |
| Occupational prestige | -0.0249 | 0.005 | -0.030 (sign flips) |
| Female | -0.0718 | -0.070 | -0.0018 (close) |
| Age | 0.0584 | 0.126** | -0.0676 |
| Black | 0.0498 | 0.042 | +0.0078 |
| Hispanic | -0.0309 | -0.029 | -0.0019 (close) |
| Other race | 0.0919 | 0.047 | +0.0449 |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.145 | 0.048 | +0.097 (huge) + stars mismatch |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | 0.024 | not estimated |
| Southern | 0.0985 | 0.069 | +0.0295 |

**Bottom line:** these aren’t minor rounding differences; several signs flip and magnitudes are off. That implies **different sample and/or different variable construction and/or different standardization** (or even different model form).

---

## 4) Sample size (N) mismatches (major)

- **Generated N:**
  - Model A N = **394**
  - Model B N = **395**
- **True N:**
  - Model 1 N = **644**
  - Model 2 N = **605**

These are not close. This alone guarantees coefficients won’t match.

**Most likely cause:** aggressive **listwise deletion** due to huge missingness in key predictors.

Evidence in your output:
- `missingness_1993` shows missingness rates:
  - racism_score missing **0.373**
  - cons_prot missing **0.363**
  - hispanic missing **0.223**
  - DV1 and DV2 missing **~0.103**
- With multiple predictors missing at once, listwise deletion can easily drop far below 600.

**How to fix:**
1. **Use the same wave/year and same restriction criteria as Bryson**
   - If Bryson used a pooled sample, different year, or a different subset, your N will differ.
2. **Replicate Bryson’s missing-data treatment**
   - If Bryson used imputation, “missing” categories, or constructed racism score only when enough items answered, you must match that.
3. **Apply weights if required (GSS design weights)**
   - Weights won’t change N but may be tied to inclusion rules in replication workflows.
4. **Ensure you are using the correct dataset version and variable availability**
   - Your `cons_prot` missingness suggests it may not be defined for many cases (construction problem), not truly “missing religion”.

---

## 5) R² / Adjusted R² mismatches

- **Generated:**
  - Model A R² = **0.161**, Adj R² = **0.137**
  - Model B R² = **0.134**, Adj R² = **0.109**
- **True:**
  - Model 1 R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**
  - Model 2 R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**

Both models’ fit stats differ (Model 2 especially: 0.134 vs 0.147).

**How to fix:** Once you fix **sample definition**, **variable coding**, and **inclusion of no_religion**, these should move closer. If they still don’t match, it indicates remaining discrepancies in:
- standardization method (see §6),
- DV construction (see §7),
- or weighting/model estimator.

---

## 6) Standardization / coefficient computation mismatches

The paper reports **standardized OLS coefficients**. That can be reproduced in multiple ways, but they must match:

Common replication pitfall:
- Standardizing **after** listwise deletion vs **before**,
- Using sample SD with **ddof=0** vs **ddof=1**,
- Standardizing only X’s vs standardizing both X and Y (beta equivalence depends on method),
- Using weighted vs unweighted SDs.

**How to fix (recommended replication approach):**
- Fit OLS on the *original scales*, then compute standardized betas as:  
  \[
  \beta_j^{std} = b_j \times \frac{SD(X_j)}{SD(Y)}
  \]
  using the **same analytic sample** and the **same SD definition** as the replication target (usually sample SD, ddof=1).
- Alternatively, z‑score Y and all X’s within the analytic sample and run OLS; the slopes equal standardized betas if done consistently.

Given your betas show sign flips and big gaps, standardization alone is not the main issue—but you must standardize the same way once the sample is correct.

---

## 7) DV construction likely differs (another major source)

True DVs:
- DV1: dislike count of **Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin** (0–6)
- DV2: dislike count of **the 12 remaining genres** (0–12)

Your descriptives:
- DV1 max = 6, DV2 max = 12 (good),
- Means: DV1 1.98, DV2 3.65 (plausible),
- But the regression sample differs (N ~394), so DV construction may not be the primary issue.

Still, check these specific pitfalls:
- What counts as “dislike”? (e.g., “dislike” vs “strongly dislike” vs a binary from a multi-category like/dislike scale)
- Treatment of “don’t know,” “not asked,” “never heard,” missing.

**How to fix:**
- Match Bryson’s rule exactly for coding “dislike” and handling DK/NA.
- Confirm the exact set of 18 genres in that year/wave matches the paper.

---

## 8) Constant (intercept) mismatches

- **Model 1 constant**
  - Generated: **2.656933***  
  - True: **2.415***  
- **Model 2 constant**
  - Generated: **5.277301***  
  - True: **7.860** (note: in the true table it’s shown without stars)

**Interpretation:** intercepts are extremely sensitive to coding and sample. Your Model 2 constant is *dramatically* different.

**How to fix:**
- Ensure the DV is on the same scale (count from 0).
- Ensure all predictors are on their original (unstandardized) scale when estimating the constant, or, if the table’s constant comes from a model with unstandardized variables but standardized betas reported, that’s typical: **betas standardized, constant unstandardized**.
- Include `no_religion` and match reference categories.

Also: your output attaches `***` to Model 2 constant, but the “True Results” list “Constant 7.860” without stars. That may be transcription, but if you are aiming to match “as printed,” you must match the star display too.

---

## 9) Significance/star mismatches and interpretation errors

### A. Wrong stars on some effects
Examples:
- Model 1 Age:
  - Generated: 0.093 (no stars)
  - True: 0.163***  
- Model 2 Conservative Protestant:
  - Generated: 0.145**  
  - True: 0.048 (no stars)

This follows from coefficient differences and/or different SE/p computations.

### B. You should not imply SEs exist
You asked to compare “standard errors,” but:
- **True table has none.**
- **Generated results do not show SEs either** (so there is no direct SE mismatch), but any narrative implying SE replication would be incorrect.

**How to fix interpretation/reporting:**
- State explicitly: “Table 2 reports standardized coefficients and significance only; standard errors are not available from the published table.”
- If you compute p-values yourself, label them as **replication-derived**, not “as in Bryson.”

## 10) Concrete steps to make the generated analysis match Table 2

1. **Use the correct analytic sample**
   - Reproduce Bryson’s N (≈644 and 605).  
   - Diagnose which variable(s) eliminate most cases. Start with a missingness table *after* all recodes but *before* listwise deletion; then show how many cases remain after each inclusion criterion.

2. **Fix `no_religion`**
   - Verify it has both 0/1 in the final analytic sample.
   - If it becomes constant, you are filtering out all “no religion” respondents—fix the upstream issue.

3. **Match variable coding/reference categories**
   - Race dummies: confirm White is reference and “Other race” excludes Hispanic/Black appropriately (paper’s exact scheme matters).
   - Southern: confirm definition (Census South? self-ID? region variable?) matches Bryson.
   - Conservative Protestant: confirm construction (denomination-based) and that it’s not missing for a large fraction due to a coding bug.

4. **Match DV “dislike” definition**
   - Confirm exactly which response category counts as “dislike” and how missing/DK are handled.

5. **Compute standardized betas in a replication-consistent way**
   - Estimate OLS on unstandardized variables, then convert to standardized betas using SD(X)/SD(Y) computed on the same analytic sample (and same weighting choice as the paper).

6. **Do not report SE mismatches**
   - Since the paper does not provide SEs, your comparison should be: coefficients, stars, R²/Adj R², N, constant, and variable inclusion.

---

### Quick diagnostic you should run (to locate the main break)
- Produce a table of **case counts remaining** after requiring non-missingness for:
  1) each DV,
  2) racism score,
  3) religion variables (to debug `cons_prot` and `no_religion`),
  4) income/occ prestige,
  5) race/ethnicity,
  6) region (South).

The step where N collapses from ~1400 to ~394 will tell you exactly what to fix first.

If you paste your data source (e.g., GSS year, variable names for religion/denomination and music dislikes) and your recode rules for `racism_score`, `cons_prot`, and `no_religion`, I can pinpoint the specific coding or filtering choice that produces the wrong N and the dropped `no_religion`.
