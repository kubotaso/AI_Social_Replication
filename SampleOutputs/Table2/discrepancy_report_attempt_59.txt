Score: 18/100
============================================================

### 1) What the “true” table contains vs what you generated
**Key discrepancy:** Bryson (1996) Table 2 reports **standardized OLS coefficients (betas) + significance stars only**. It **does not report standard errors**.  
Your “paper_style” tables mix (a) coefficients labeled as if they were standardized betas, (b) significance stars computed from your regression p-values, and (c) constants—creating multiple mismatches in both **numbers and interpretation**.

**Fix:** Treat Table 2 as a target of **standardized coefficients only**. Do **not** claim SEs are from the paper. If you want SEs, you must (i) run the model on the same data and (ii) clearly label them as *your computed SEs*, not “from Table 2”.

---

## 2) Variable-name / variable-inclusion mismatches

### 2.1 Missing variable in generated paper-style tables: `no_religion`
- **True Table 2 includes:** *No religion* in both models (0.057 in Model 1; 0.024 in Model 2).
- **Generated paper_style tables:** do **not** include `no_religion`.
- **Generated fit tables:** explicitly say `dropped_zero_variance_predictors = no_religion` and diagnostics show `no_religion` has **n_unique = 1, mean = 0.000** (a constant 0), so it was dropped.

**Fix options:**
1. **Data fix (preferred):** Recode religion so `no_religion` varies (0/1) as in the GSS. Right now it’s all zeros, meaning your sample/recode is wrong.
2. **Reporting fix:** If you cannot fix the data, explicitly state “No religion omitted due to zero variance” and **do not present the model as a replication of Table 2**.

### 2.2 DV naming differs (not fatal, but must match the paper language)
- True DV Model 1: “Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin”
- Your DV name: `dislike_minority_genres` (ok conceptually) but your model label says `Table2_ModelA_dislike_minority6`
- True DV Model 2: “Dislike of the 12 remaining genres”
- Your DV name: `dislike_other12_genres`

**Fix:** In output, use the **paper’s DV wording** (or provide a clear mapping: *ModelA = minority-liked 6 genres; ModelB = remaining 12*).

---

## 3) Coefficient (standardized beta) mismatches — Model 1

Below I compare the **true standardized coefficient** to your **generated `beta_std` / “paper_style coef”** (they appear to match each other), and flag mismatches.

### Model 1 (true N=644, R²=.145, Adj R²=.129; your N=281, R²=.123)
Major structural mismatch: **sample size is less than half**, so you should not expect coefficients to match.

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.130** | 0.111 | **Sign + close-ish magnitude**, but **stars differ** (true **, generated none) |
| Education | -0.175*** | -0.227** | **Magnitude & stars differ** (too negative; should be ***) |
| Income per capita | -0.037 | -0.004 | **Large mismatch** |
| Occ prestige | -0.020 | +0.071 | **Wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.057 | -0.017 | Smaller magnitude |
| Age | 0.163*** | 0.072 | **Too small; stars missing** |
| Black | -0.132*** | -0.188** | Too negative; stars differ (*** vs **) |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | +0.006 | **Wrong sign** |
| Other race | -0.017 | +0.003 | **Wrong sign** |
| Cons Protestant | 0.063 | 0.076 | close-ish |
| No religion | 0.057 | **omitted** | **Missing** |
| Southern | 0.024 | 0.018 | close-ish |
| Constant | 2.415*** | 2.546*** | differs (also: constant in a “standardized coefficients” table is tricky—see §6) |

**Fixes needed to match Model 1:**
- Use the **same sample definition** as Bryson (GSS 1993; N≈644 after his exclusions). Your N=281 implies filtering/missing-data handling differs drastically.
- Ensure the **DV is constructed identically** (exact same 6 genres, same coding, same “count of genres disliked” rule).
- Ensure independent variables are coded like Bryson (especially **racism scale**, **income per capita**, and **religion categories**).
- Compute and report **standardized coefficients** the same way (see §6).

---

## 4) Coefficient mismatches — Model 2

True Model 2 has **racism positive (0.080)** and **age positive and significant (0.126\*\*)**; your Model B has racism near zero and **age near zero**, plus sign flips on some predictors.

| Variable | True beta | Generated beta | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.080 | -0.008 | **Wrong sign** |
| Education | -0.242*** | -0.245*** | matches well |
| Income per capita | -0.065 | -0.037 | smaller magnitude |
| Occ prestige | 0.005 | -0.074 | **Wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.070 | -0.071 | matches well |
| Age | 0.126** | 0.007 | **Near zero; missing significance** |
| Black | 0.042 | 0.000 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | -0.029 | -0.087 | too negative |
| Other race | 0.047 | 0.060 | close-ish |
| Cons Protestant | 0.048 | 0.179** | **far too large; wrong significance** |
| No religion | 0.024 | **omitted** | **Missing** |
| Southern | 0.069 | 0.132* | too large |
| Constant | 7.860 | 6.928*** | differs; also stars shouldn’t be inferred from Table 2 |

**Fixes needed to match Model 2:**
- Same as Model 1 (sample, DV construction, coding).
- Pay special attention to **age**: your age effect is ~0 in Model 2, but the paper reports a meaningful positive effect. That commonly happens if:
  - you standardized incorrectly,
  - you changed the DV definition,
  - you have restricted age range / missingness,
  - or you inadvertently included controls/interactions not in the paper (doesn’t appear so from the term list, but sample selection can do it).

---

## 5) Significance-star mismatches (interpretation/reporting error)

### 5.1 You are assigning stars using your p-values, but the target stars come from Bryson’s model
Even if your coefficients were close, your stars will differ unless you have:
- identical N,
- identical model specification,
- identical coding,
- identical handling of weights/design (if any),
- identical missing-data strategy.

**Fix:** If the goal is to reproduce Table 2, you must reproduce the **same model**, then compute stars from *that* model. Otherwise, remove stars or label them “from our estimation”.

### 5.2 You cannot infer stars/SEs from Table 2 beyond what is shown
Table 2 provides standardized coefficients and stars; **SEs are not available**.

**Fix:** Remove any claims like “standard errors from Table 2”. If you report SEs, label: “SEs from our re-estimation on [dataset], not reported in Bryson (1996) Table 2.”

---

## 6) Standardization / constant reporting problems

### 6.1 Constant in a “standardized coefficient” table
Bryson’s table includes a “Constant” value, but the table is described as “Standardized OLS coefficients.” In many workflows:
- predictors are standardized but DV is not → constants are meaningful,
- or betas are computed post-hoc (beta = b * sd(x)/sd(y)) while constant remains the unstandardized intercept.

Your generated output mixes:
- `ModelA_full` unstandardized `b` (e.g., racism b=0.11897),
- and `beta_std` (racism beta=0.111),
- while also printing a constant in “paper_style” alongside standardized-looking entries.

**Fix:** Decide and document one of these:
1. **Replicate Bryson’s presentation:** report **standardized betas** (for slopes) and the intercept as he reports it (likely unstandardized). Then label columns clearly (e.g., “Std. coef.” and “Intercept”).
2. Or present a fully standardized model (including DV), in which case intercept ~0 and Bryson’s constant would not match.

Given the paper, option (1) is the only plausible route.

### 6.2 Your `paper_style coef` appears to be `beta_std`, not the unstandardized `b`
Example Model A:
- `ModelA_full` racism: **b = 0.11897**, beta_std = **0.11116**
- `ModelA_paper_style` racism coef = **0.111158**
So you’re outputting **standardized**, which is correct relative to Table 2—but then you must ensure *all variables and sample match*.

---

## 7) Model fit mismatches (N and R²)

- **True Model 1:** N=644, R²=.145, Adj R²=.129  
  **Generated:** N=281, R²=.123, Adj R²=.087
- **True Model 2:** N=605, R²=.147, Adj R²=.130  
  **Generated:** N=279, R²=.156, Adj R²=.121

**Fix:** The huge N gap is the biggest red flag. To fix:
- Use **GSS 1993** and the same inclusion criteria.
- Reconstruct the two DV indices exactly as Bryson did.
- Use the same missing-data rule (likely listwise deletion, but verify).
- Ensure `no_religion` is correctly measured (not all zeros).
- Confirm any weighting/design choices used in the article (if any). Even without weights, N should be in the 600s if you’re using the right data/year and not over-filtering.

---

## 8) Additional internal red flags in your diagnostics (likely coding errors)

### 8.1 `hispanic` mean ≈ 0.918 in both models
That implies **~92% of your sample is coded Hispanic=1**, which is not plausible for GSS 1993.

**Interpretation:** Your `hispanic` dummy is almost certainly **miscoded or reversed** (maybe “not Hispanic” coded as 1; or a multi-category race/ethnicity variable was converted incorrectly).

**Fix:** Rebuild race/ethnicity dummies from the raw GSS variables:
- Ensure mutually exclusive categories align with the paper (Black, Hispanic, Other race, with White as reference—likely).
- Check coding: 1 = in group, 0 = not in group.
- Verify means: in a national sample, Hispanic proportion should be far lower than 0.92.

This miscoding alone can flip signs for “Hispanic”, “Other race”, and distort other coefficients via collinearity.

### 8.2 `no_religion` is all zeros
Already discussed—also indicates either:
- your sample excludes non-religious respondents, or
- you recoded missing as 0 incorrectly, or
- you used the wrong source variable.

**Fix:** audit the recode and tabulate raw religion values before dummying.

# Summary of “how to fix so the generated analysis matches Table 2”
1. **Use the correct dataset/year and sample:** GSS 1993, replicate Bryson’s exclusions; aim for **N≈644 and N≈605**.
2. **Reconstruct the DVs exactly:** counts of genres disliked for the exact genre sets described.
3. **Fix race/ethnicity coding:** your `hispanic` dummy is almost certainly wrong (mean ~0.92).
4. **Fix `no_religion`:** must vary; don’t drop it.
5. **Report the same estimand:** standardized betas for slopes; do not invent SEs from Table 2.
6. **Stars:** only compare stars after you truly replicate the model; otherwise remove or label as “from our estimation”.

If you paste your code (or at least your variable construction steps for the DVs, racism score, race/ethnicity, and religion), I can point to the exact lines that are producing the N drop, the Hispanic miscoding, and the zero-variance `no_religion`.
