Score: 0/100
============================================================

### 1) Core mismatch: your “generated results” contain **no estimable models**
**Generated**  
- `modelA_analytic_frame` and `modelB_analytic_frame` are **empty data frames** (0 rows).  
- `combined_fit` shows **N = 0**, R²/Adj R²/Constant are **NaN**.  
- `combined_table2_betas` is **all NaN**.

**True (Bryson 1996 Table 2)**  
- Model 1: **N = 644**, R² = **0.145**, Adj R² = **0.129**, Constant = **2.415***, and 12 standardized coefficients.
- Model 2: **N = 605**, R² = **0.147**, Adj R² = **0.130**, Constant = **7.860**, and 12 standardized coefficients.

**How to fix**
- You must construct a non-empty analytic sample. Right now you are effectively doing listwise deletion with at least one variable that is missing for everyone (see §2), forcing N→0.
- After fixing the missing-for-all variable(s), re-run the model-building step and verify:
  - `len(modelA_analytic_frame) == 644` (or at least close, depending on exact replication rules)
  - `len(modelB_analytic_frame) == 605`
  - R²/Adj R² match the table approximately (exact match if all coding aligns).

### 2) Smoking gun causing N=0: **Conservative Protestant is 100% missing**
**Generated**
- `cons_prot` labeled “NOT REPRODUCIBLE…” has `share_missing = 1.000000` in both missingness tables.
- Because it is included in the model frame, listwise deletion drops **every case**.

**True**
- “Conservative Protestant” is a real predictor in both models with coefficients:
  - Model 1: **0.063**
  - Model 2: **0.048**

**How to fix**
- Either:
  1) **Correctly construct Conservative Protestant** from the available religion variables (denomination/fundamentalism/affiliation—whatever Bryson used), *or*
  2) If the dataset genuinely lacks the needed fields, **drop this predictor from the replication** and explicitly note the model is not fully comparable (but then you should not claim you are matching Table 2).
- Practically: do **not** include variables with 100% missingness in the regression design matrix.

---

### 3) Variable-name mismatches vs the “true” table labels
Most of your generated variable labels *correspond* to the table conceptually, but there are still important naming/coding uncertainties:

#### 3.1 Racism score definition discrepancy risk
**Generated label**
- “Racism score (0–5; strict sum of 5 dichotomies)” with ~47.6% missing.

**True**
- “Racism score” (no construction details shown in Table 2). The table implies it exists for most respondents used in the model (since N is large).

**Mismatch**
- Your construction may not match Bryson’s (items used, coding direction, handling DK/NA), and your missingness is extremely high for a key predictor, which can distort N and coefficients.

**How to fix**
- Replicate the racism index exactly:
  - Use the same items and response recodes as Bryson.
  - Don’t set the index to missing if *one* item is missing unless the paper did so; often scholars use mean of available items with a minimum answered threshold.
  - Verify distribution and missingness aligns with expected survey patterns (it should not wipe out nearly half the sample unless the original items were asked of a subset).

#### 3.2 Hispanic construction is flagged as “approx”
**Generated**
- “Hispanic (approx from ETHNIC==1 if available; else missing)” with 22.3% missing.

**True**
- “Hispanic” is a standard dummy in the table and clearly not “approx.”

**How to fix**
- Use the exact race/ethnicity variable definitions from the survey year Bryson analyzed (likely GSS-style Hispanic origin variable if this is GSS, or NES-style, etc.).
- Avoid “else missing” logic that creates artificial missingness; if ETHNIC not available, you need another source variable, not missing-by-design.

---

### 4) Coefficients and significance: **every coefficient is missing vs true non-missing**
**Generated**
- All `ModelA_Std_Beta` and `ModelB_Std_Beta` are NaN, and replication significance fields are blank.

**True coefficients (must appear in your output if you replicate)**
Model 1 (minority-linked genres):
- Racism **0.130**  
- Education **-0.175**  
- Income **-0.037**  
- Prestige **-0.020**  
- Female **-0.057**  
- Age **0.163**  
- Black **-0.132**  
- Hispanic **-0.058**  
- Other race **-0.017**  
- Cons Prot **0.063**  
- No religion **0.057**  
- Southern **0.024**

Model 2 (remaining genres):
- Racism **0.080**  
- Education **-0.242**  
- Income **-0.065**  
- Prestige **0.005**  
- Female **-0.070**  
- Age **0.126**  
- Black **0.042**  
- Hispanic **-0.029**  
- Other race **0.047**  
- Cons Prot **0.048**  
- No religion **0.024**  
- Southern **0.069**

**How to fix**
- Fix analytic frame (non-empty) first (esp. Conservative Protestant).
- Ensure you are estimating **standardized OLS coefficients** (see §6), then populate the table from the fitted model’s standardized betas.

---

### 5) Fit statistics mismatch: N, R², constants all absent vs true values
**Generated**
- Model A DV row: N=0; R²/Adj R² NaN; constant NaN.
- Model B DV row: N=0; R²/Adj R² NaN; constant NaN.

**True**
- Model 1: N=644; R²=0.145; Adj R²=0.129; Constant=2.415***  
- Model 2: N=605; R²=0.147; Adj R²=0.130; Constant=7.860

**How to fix**
- Once models run, verify:
  - DV construction matches Bryson (counts of dislikes) so intercepts are comparable.
  - Same sample restrictions (year = 1993 per your diagnostics; ensure that matches Bryson’s analytic year and weighting).
  - Same treatment of missing and “don’t know.”

---

### 6) “Standard errors” and “interpretation” mismatches
#### 6.1 Standard errors: the true table **does not report SEs**
**Generated request focus** includes “standard errors,” but your generated results don’t include SEs anyway (just NaNs).

**True**
- Bryson Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients and significance stars**, not SEs.

**Mismatch**
- If your replication output is trying to compare SEs to the paper: you can’t—there are none in the published table.

**How to fix**
- Do not claim mismatch on SEs relative to the paper.
- If you want significance stars like the table, compute p-values from your model (which requires SEs), then map to stars; but note that different weighting/robust SE choices can change stars.

#### 6.2 Interpretation: your generated output provides no substantive interpretation
**Generated**
- No interpretation is shown; only placeholders and missingness diagnostics.

**True**
- Interpretations implied by signs:
  - Education decreases “dislike” in both models (stronger for remaining genres).
  - Racism increases dislike of minority-linked genres more (0.130**) than remaining genres (0.080, ns).
  - Age increases dislike in both.

**How to fix**
- After obtaining actual betas, interpret standardized coefficients correctly: “a 1 SD increase in X is associated with a β SD change in DV,” not unit changes.

### 7) Additional likely hidden mismatches (coding/measurement) that will prevent matching even after N>0
These aren’t directly shown as mismatches in your printout, but they are the usual reasons replications fail after the “N=0” bug is fixed:

1) **DV construction**: “dislike count” must match exactly (which response categories count as “dislike,” how neutral/unknown handled, and whether missing genre responses drop the case vs count denominator).
2) **Income per capita**: you used `REALINC/HOMPOP`. Bryson may have used a different income measure or equivalence scale, or handled HOMPOP=0/NA differently.
3) **Prestige**: `PRESTG80` may have top-coding/missing codes that you need to recode before standardizing.
4) **Weights**: Table 2 might be weighted; your output does not show weights. Weighting affects coefficients and significance.
5) **Standardization method**: To match “standardized OLS coefficients,” you must standardize variables consistently (typically z-score predictors and DV, then run OLS; or compute standardized betas from unstandardized regression using SDs from the analytic sample).

---

## Minimal actionable checklist to make the generated analysis match Table 2
1) **Remove/repair `cons_prot`** so it is not 100% missing (construct properly or exclude).
2) Rebuild analytic frames; confirm **N ≈ 644** and **605** for Models 1 and 2.
3) Ensure DVs are **exactly** the two dislike counts used by Bryson.
4) Recode all predictors to match Bryson (especially racism index + Hispanic).
5) Run OLS and output **standardized coefficients**; compute stars from p-values.
6) Compare coefficients, R², Adj R², and constants to the true table; iterate on coding until aligned.

If you share the code used to build `cons_prot`, `racism_score`, and the two DV counts (plus the source variable names), I can point to the exact line(s) that zero out the sample and the exact recodes that will move your betas toward Bryson’s.
