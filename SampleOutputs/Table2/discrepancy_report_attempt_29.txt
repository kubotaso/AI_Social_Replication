Score: 12/100
============================================================

Below is a complete item-by-item comparison of your **Generated Results** against the **True Results (Bryson 1996 Table 2)**, followed by concrete fixes to make the generated analysis match the published table.

---

## 1) Core design mismatch: your models are not estimating the same thing as the paper

### Mismatch
- **Your analytic N**: Model 1 **309**, Model 2 **305**
- **True N**: Model 1 **644**, Model 2 **605**

This is not a minor discrepancy—it guarantees coefficient, significance, and fit differences. Your own missingness tables show huge missingness on key predictors (e.g., racism_score ~0.373, cons_prot ~0.363). That implies you are doing **listwise deletion** on many variables and ending up with about half the published sample.

### How to fix
To match the paper, you must replicate the paper’s sample construction and missing-data handling. Likely options (you need to verify from the paper’s methods/data appendix):

1) **Recode missing values correctly**  
   In GSS-style data, “missing” is often coded as 8/9/98/99 etc. If those weren’t converted to NA properly, you can create artificial missingness or distort scales.  
   - Fix: apply the correct missing-value codes per variable before any indices/scales.

2) **Match Bryson’s inclusion rules**  
   Bryson’s N (644/605) suggests **not** dropping to 309 via strict listwise deletion across everything you included (especially religion and racism).  
   - Fix: replicate the exact variables and coding used in Table 2 and apply the same case inclusion rule (often: require DV + key covariates; allow some predictors missing via imputation or category coding).

3) **Use multiple imputation or missing indicators if that’s what the original did**  
   If the paper retained far more cases, it may have used a method other than full listwise deletion (or had far less missingness after proper recoding).
   - Fix: multiple imputation for predictors (racism items, religion), or reconstruct racism_score only for those with sufficient items, consistent with the paper.

Until N matches, you shouldn’t expect coefficients/significance/R² to match.

## 2) Variable-by-variable coefficient and significance mismatches (Model 1)

DV: *Dislike of Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, and Latin Music*

### Coefficients/significance that do not match the paper

| Variable | Generated (Std Beta, Sig) | True (Coef) | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.168** | 0.130** | Too large |
| Education | -0.280*** | -0.175*** | Much more negative |
| Occupational prestige | +0.0767 | -0.020 | Wrong sign + magnitude |
| Female | -0.0255 | -0.057 | Too small |
| Age | 0.169** | 0.163*** | Similar size but wrong sig level |
| Black | -0.155 | -0.132*** | Missing significance + slightly off |
| Hispanic | +0.024 | -0.058 | Wrong sign |
| Other race | -0.00295 | -0.017 | Smaller magnitude |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.0679 | 0.063 | Close (OK-ish) |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | 0.057 | You dropped it; should be estimated |
| Southern | -0.0468 | +0.024 | Wrong sign |

### How to fix (Model 1)
1) **Stop dropping “No religion”**  
   Your output says `Dropped_no_variation = no_religion` and shows NaN. But your own frequency table shows variation (0/1 plus some missing), so this is an implementation error.
   - Likely cause: you filtered the sample in a way that left only one category, *or* you accidentally encoded it as all-missing/all-constant after recode.
   - Fix: check after all filtering:
     - `no_religion.value_counts(dropna=False)`
     - ensure it’s coded 0/1 and not all NA
     - ensure you didn’t subset to a religious-only group

2) **Align the exact coding of race/ethnicity variables**
   - The paper uses **Black, Hispanic, Other race** (implicitly with White as the reference).
   - Your “quickcheck” shows a messy `ethnic` variable with many values (1, 3, 97, 30, etc.), plus missing. This suggests your race/ethnicity recode may not match Bryson’s.
   - Fix: reproduce Bryson’s categories exactly (White reference; Black=1 else 0; Hispanic=1 else 0; Other race=1 else 0), and confirm mutual exclusivity.

3) **Verify DV construction matches Bryson**
   If your DV “minority_linked_6” isn’t constructed exactly like the paper (same items, same missing handling, same scaling), coefficients will drift and signs can flip.
   - Fix: ensure DV1 is exactly the sum/count of “dislike” responses for the 6 listed genres, with the same response coding and missing handling as Bryson.

4) **Check the direction of “Southern”**
   Wrong sign strongly suggests:
   - you coded South reversed (e.g., 1=not South), or
   - used a different “region” variable or coding frame.
   - Fix: verify `southern==1` truly means Southern states, matching GSS region coding.

## 3) Variable-by-variable coefficient and significance mismatches (Model 2)

DV: *Dislike of the 12 Remaining Genres*

### Coefficients/significance that do not match

| Variable | Generated (Std Beta, Sig) | True (Coef) | What’s wrong |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.0398 | 0.080 | Too small |
| Education | -0.234*** | -0.242*** | Close (good) |
| Household income pc | -0.0533 | -0.065 | Slightly off |
| Occupational prestige | -0.0189 | +0.005 | Wrong sign |
| Female | -0.0749 | -0.070 | Close (good) |
| Age | 0.0786 | 0.126** | Too small; missing significance |
| Black | -0.0384 | +0.042 | Wrong sign |
| Hispanic | +0.1377 | -0.029 | Wrong sign and huge |
| Other race | +0.0934 | +0.047 | Too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.1255* | 0.048 | Too large; wrong sig |
| No religion | NaN (dropped) | 0.024 | Dropped incorrectly |
| Southern | 0.0986 | 0.069 | Somewhat high |

### How to fix (Model 2)
Same key fixes as Model 1, plus:

- **Your Hispanic effect is wildly wrong in sign and magnitude**, which usually indicates a coding error (e.g., Hispanic variable includes missing codes as “1”, or is not a dummy, or the reference group differs).
  - Fix: audit `hispanic` coding carefully (frequency table shows 0, 1, and nan—good—but you must ensure 1 truly means Hispanic and that it’s not derived from the messy `ethnic` codes incorrectly).

---

## 4) Model fit statistics mismatch (R², Adj R², Constant)

### Model 1 fit mismatch
- Generated: **R² 0.189**, Adj R² 0.159, Constant **2.5907***, N=309  
- True: **R² 0.145**, Adj R² 0.129, Constant **2.415***, N=644

### Model 2 fit mismatch
- Generated: **R² 0.156**, Adj R² 0.125, Constant **5.5494***, N=305  
- True: **R² 0.147**, Adj R² 0.130, Constant **7.860** (paper reports 7.860; no stars shown), N=605

### How to fix
- These differences are consistent with **different samples, different DV scaling, and/or different covariate coding**.
- First priority is to **match N and DV construction**. The constant in particular is sensitive to DV scale/centering and sample composition.

## 5) Interpretation/significance reporting mismatches

### Mismatch
- The true table uses stars based on p-values for standardized coefficients. Your stars don’t match (e.g., Age in Model 1 is *** in the paper but ** for you; Black is *** in paper but none for you).

### How to fix
Once the model/data match, compute p-values correctly:
- For standardized OLS coefficients, you can either:
  - fit OLS on unstandardized variables and then standardize betas post hoc (but keep correct SEs from the unstandardized model), or
  - standardize variables first (z-scores) and run OLS; the coefficients are standardized betas and standard t-tests apply.
Either approach is fine—**but only if the underlying sample and coding match**.

Also note: the paper reports **no SEs**, so your task is to match **betas + stars**, not SEs.

---

## 6) Specific “internal inconsistency” in your generated output: “Dropped_no_variation = no_religion”

### Mismatch
- Your `quickcheck_distributions` shows `no_religion` has values 0 and 1 (and some missing), so it should not be “no variation” in the full data.
- Yet you drop it in both models.

### How to fix
- Check variation **in the analytic sample after listwise deletion**. It’s possible that after your filtering, everyone left has `no_religion=0` (e.g., because missingness is correlated with other filters).
- Fix options:
  1) Change missing handling to keep a broader sample (to match Bryson).
  2) Don’t filter on a variable that indirectly removes all “no religion” cases.
  3) If you created religion categories from another variable, ensure “no religion” isn’t being overwritten to 0 for all nonresponses.

---

## 7) Summary of “every mismatch” (as requested)

### Variable name mismatches
- None that are purely cosmetic (your labels match), **but** your underlying race/ethnicity construction appears inconsistent with the paper (your `ethnic` variable is not aligned with Bryson’s dummy set).

### Coefficient mismatches
- Model 1: Racism, Education, Occ prestige (sign), Hispanic (sign), Southern (sign), Black significance, etc.
- Model 2: Racism, Occ prestige (sign), Age (size/sig), Black (sign), Hispanic (sign and huge), Conservative Protestant (too large), etc.

### Standard errors mismatches
- Not applicable to matching Table 2 because Bryson does not report SEs. If your pipeline is trying to compare SEs, that’s a category error.

### Interpretation mismatches
- Your significance stars do not align with the published ones—this is a consequence of mismatched N/coding and possibly different standardization/testing.

## 8) Minimal path to make your generated analysis match the paper

1) **Recreate DV1 and DV2 exactly** (items, coding, how “dislike” is defined, how missing items are handled).
2) **Recreate racism_score exactly** (item coding direction, allowed missing items, scaling).
3) **Recode ethnicity/race exactly into the three dummies** used by Bryson with White as reference.
4) **Fix religion dummies so “No religion” is included** and not dropped.
5) **Match sample selection to get N≈644 and 605** (or understand and replicate the paper’s exact case deletion rules).
6) Only then re-check: standardized betas, stars, R², constants.

If you paste your code (especially DV construction, racism_score creation, and race/religion recodes), I can pinpoint which exact recode step is causing the sign flips (Hispanic, Southern, prestige) and the “no religion dropped” bug.
