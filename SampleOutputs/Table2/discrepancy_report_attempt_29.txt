Score: 32/100
============================================================

### 1) Immediate structural discrepancy: what the “true” table contains vs what you generated
**Mismatch**
- **True Table 2 reports only standardized coefficients (betas) + significance markers. It does *not* report standard errors, t-stats, p-values, unstandardized coefficients, or “dropped predictors.”**
- Your output includes **unstandardized coefficients, standard errors, t, p**, and fit stats based on *your own regression*, not the published Table 2.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to reproduce Table 2, your “generated results” should be limited to:
  - standardized coefficients (`beta_std`)
  - significance stars (as shown in the paper)
  - N, R², adjusted R²
- Remove/avoid claiming: SEs, t, p-values, and unstandardized coefficients as if they came from Table 2.
- If you *also* want to run models yourself, present them separately as “replication analysis” and do not label them as “Bryson Table 2” unless the sample, variables, and coding match.

---

## 2) Sample size and fit statistics mismatches (major)
### Model A (your “ModelA_fit” vs true Model 1)
**Mismatch**
- **True N = 644**; you have **N = 283**.
- **True R² = .145; adj R² = .129**; you have **R² = .121; adj R² = .086**.

**Fix**
- Use the correct dataset/sample: **GSS 1993** with the same inclusion rules as Bryson.
- Ensure the DV construction matches (see Section 5).
- Apply the same missing-data handling (likely listwise deletion on variables used in the model, but with the correct variables you should end up near N=644).

### Model B (your “ModelB_fit” vs true Model 2)
**Mismatch**
- **True N = 605**; you have **N = 283**.
- **True R² = .147; adj R² = .130**; you have **R² = .133; adj R² = .098**.

**Fix**
- Same as above; additionally ensure Model 2 DV is “12 remaining genres” and the analytic sample matches Bryson’s.

---

## 3) Variable list/name mismatches and a clear omission
Your tables show 12 rows including the constant, but **you do not display variable names**. However, you *do* report:

> `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: no_religion`

That directly contradicts the paper, where **No religion is included** with a coefficient in both models.

**Mismatch**
- You dropped **No religion**, but it must be included and vary in the sample.

**Fix**
- Diagnose why `no_religion` is zero variance:
  - You may have filtered the sample to only religious respondents or recoded missing as a single category.
  - You may have created `no_religion` incorrectly (e.g., all 0/False due to a coding bug).
- Correct coding: create a binary indicator for “no religion” from the GSS religion variable(s), and verify it has both 0 and 1 in the analytic sample before regression.

Also: the paper includes **Southern**. Your models say k_predictors=11 (plus constant) which matches the paper’s 12 predictors, but without names it’s impossible to verify you actually included **Southern** (and all race dummies, etc.). The “dropped no_religion” suggests you likely did *not* match the full set.

**Fix**
- Output tables with explicit variable names in the same order as the paper.

---

## 4) Standardized coefficients: coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches

Below I compare your **beta_std** to the **true standardized coefficients**. Because your output doesn’t label rows, I infer row identity by matching patterns (e.g., education is strongly negative in both; age positive in model 1, etc.). Even with that generous mapping, many values (and signs) do not match.

### Model 1 (paper) vs your “ModelA_table_paper_style”
**True Model 1 betas (with stars)**  
Racism 0.130**; Educ -0.175***; Inc -0.037; Occ -0.020; Female -0.057; Age 0.163***; Black -0.132***; Hisp -0.058; Other -0.017; ConsProt 0.063; NoRel 0.057; South 0.024.

**Your Model A beta_std list**  
0.1109; -0.2260**; -0.0073; 0.0788; -0.0174; 0.0719; -0.1799; -0.0046; 0.0043; 0.0760; 0.0169; (constant NaN)

**Mismatches (substantive)**
- **Education**: true **-0.175*** vs your approx **-0.226** (too large in magnitude and wrong significance level).
- **Income per capita**: true **-0.037** vs your **-0.007** (near zero).
- **Occupational prestige**: true **-0.020** vs your **+0.079** (wrong sign, much larger).
- **Female**: true **-0.057** vs your **-0.017** (too small).
- **Age**: true **+0.163*** vs your **+0.072** (too small; also not significant in your run).
- **Black**: true **-0.132*** vs your **-0.180** (more negative; and your significance appears missing).
- **Hispanic**: true **-0.058** vs your **-0.005** (near zero).
- **Other race**: true **-0.017** vs your **+0.004** (sign mismatch).
- **No religion**: true **+0.057**; you (likely) don’t have it (dropped), and nothing in your betas equals ~0.057.
- **Southern**: true **+0.024**; nothing in your betas clearly matches this either.

Even the ones that are “close-ish” (racism 0.110 vs 0.130; conservative protestant ~0.076 vs 0.063) are not exact, which is expected given your **wrong N and DV construction**.

**Fix**
- This isn’t a “rounding” problem; it’s a **model/data mismatch**. To fix, you must replicate:
  1) the correct DVs (exact genre sets and summing rule),
  2) the correct predictors and coding,
  3) the correct sample (GSS 1993; N~644 after listwise deletion),
  4) standardized betas (standardize variables as Bryson did—typically standardized within the analytic sample).

### Model 2 (paper) vs your “ModelB_table_paper_style”
**True Model 2 betas**  
Racism 0.080; Educ -0.242***; Inc -0.065; Occ 0.005; Female -0.070; Age 0.126**; Black 0.042; Hisp -0.029; Other 0.047; ConsProt 0.048; NoRel 0.024; South 0.069.

**Your Model B beta_std list**  
-0.0367; -0.2414***; -0.0441; -0.0463; -0.0630; 0.0249; 0.0628; -0.1064; 0.0649; 0.1718**; 0.1145*; (constant NaN)

**Mismatches**
- **Racism**: true **+0.080** vs your **-0.037** (wrong sign).
- **Occupational prestige**: true **+0.005** vs your **-0.046** (wrong sign, too large).
- **Age**: true **+0.126** vs your **+0.025** (far too small).
- **Hispanic**: true **-0.029** vs your **-0.106** (too negative).
- **Conservative Protestant**: true **+0.048** vs your **+0.172** (way too large).
- **No religion**: true **+0.024**; again you likely dropped it.
- **Southern**: true **+0.069**; not clearly present.
- **Black/Other**: true Black **+0.042** and Other **+0.047**; you have positives (~0.063 and ~0.065) which might be in the ballpark, but given other issues we can’t trust mapping.

**Fix**
- Same as Model 1: you must correct DV construction, coding, and sample. The racism sign flip is a strong indicator you are not estimating the published model.

---

## 5) DV construction mismatch (very likely the root cause)
The paper’s DVs are *counts of disliked genres* in two specific sets:
- Model 1: **6 genres** (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin)
- Model 2: **12 remaining genres**

Your model names suggest:
- `dislike_minority6` and `dislike_other12` (good), but your N and coefficients imply the construction or inclusion rules differ.

**Common DV-construction errors**
- Treating “don’t know / not asked” as “not disliked” instead of missing.
- Using different genre lists (wrong mapping of “Latin,” “Blues/R&B,” etc.).
- Coding “like/dislike” reversed, or using a multi-category variable incorrectly.
- Summing after imputing missing → changes sample and relationships.

**Fix**
- Recreate DVs exactly:
  - For each genre, define a binary “dislike” indicator per Bryson’s coding.
  - Set missing/NIU to missing (not 0).
  - Sum across the genre set.
  - Use listwise deletion consistent with Bryson for the regression sample.

---

## 6) Significance stars and constants: mismatches and interpretation errors
### Stars
**Mismatch**
- In your “paper style” tables, stars appear inconsistent with the p-values in your “full” tables (and also inconsistent with the *true* stars).
- Example: Model A racism: p=.083 → should have **no star**, and you show none (fine). But you show ** for education (p=.001) whereas the paper shows ***.

**Fix**
- If reproducing the paper: assign stars using the paper’s thresholds to the *paper’s reported coefficients*.
- If presenting your own model: compute stars from your p-values, but do not expect them to match the paper unless everything else matches.

### Constants
**Mismatch**
- True constants: **2.415*** (Model 1) and **7.860** (Model 2).
- Your constants (unstandardized): **2.527*** and **6.066*** (plus you incorrectly show constant as “NaN” in the standardized column, then still attach stars in a confusing way).

**Fix**
- In a “standardized coefficient table,” typically you either:
  - omit the constant entirely, or
  - report it separately as unstandardized with SE (but Table 2 does not give SEs).
- If reproducing Table 2: report constants exactly as in the table (no SE).

---

## 7) Presentation/labeling discrepancies
**Mismatch**
- Your output does not label rows with variable names, so it’s not auditable.
- Your table titles and DVs (“Table2_ModelA_dislike_minority6”) don’t match the paper title and DV descriptions.

**Fix**
- Use the paper’s variable names verbatim and the exact DV text.
- Print a clearly labeled table with the same ordering as Table 2.

---

# What you need to change so the generated analysis matches the true results
1) **Use GSS 1993** and reproduce Bryson’s analytic sample (N≈644 and N≈605 after listwise deletion).
2) **Construct the two DV counts exactly** (6 “minority-liked” genres; 12 remaining), with correct missing handling.
3) **Include all predictors** exactly as in Table 2 (including **No religion** and **Southern**) with correct dummy coding.
4) **Report only what the paper reports**: standardized betas + stars + N/R²/Adj R². Do not fabricate SEs for Table 2.
5) **Add variable names to your output** and match the order in the paper for one-to-one comparison.
6) After the above, re-estimate and verify:
   - signs and magnitudes align (within rounding),
   - stars match the thresholds (*, **, ***),
   - R²/Adj R² and N match closely.

If you paste your current variable coding definitions (especially racism score, religion dummies, race dummies, and DV construction rules), I can pinpoint exactly which coding choices are producing the largest sign/magnitude deviations (e.g., the racism sign flip in Model 2).
