Score: 20/100
============================================================

Below is a full audit of **every place the generated output fails to match Bryson (1996) Table 2**, grouped by (A) variable naming/specification, (B) coefficients + significance, (C) fit statistics/sample size/constants, and (D) interpretation/what to change so the generated analysis reproduces the table.

---

## A) Variable names / coding / specification mismatches

### A1. “No religion” is incorrectly *dropped*
- **Generated:** `No religion (RELIG==4)` is **NaN / dropped (no variation)** in both models.
- **True Table 2:** “No religion” is included with coefficients **0.057 (Model 1)** and **0.024 (Model 2)**.

**Fix**
- Your analytic sample is accidentally restricting to a subset where `RELIG==4` never occurs (or you coded `no_religion` wrong so it’s always 0/NA).
- Do **not** subset in a way that conditions on religion, and recode carefully:
  - Create a set of mutually exclusive religion dummies with a clear reference category, e.g.:
    - `cons_prot` (Conservative Protestant)
    - `no_religion`
    - reference = “all other religions”
- Verify variation **after** all sample restrictions used for the model:
  - `table(no_religion, useNA="ifany")` (R) / `value_counts()` (Python)
- If it’s still constant, your sample construction is not the paper’s.

---

### A2. Conservative Protestant definition is a “proxy” (likely not Bryson’s)
- **Generated:** `Conservative Protestant (proxy: RELIG==1 & DENOM in {1,6})`
- **True:** “Conservative Protestant” as used by Bryson is typically derived from denomination/fundamentalist classification used in GSS recodes, not a simple `RELIG==1` filter (and RELIG==1 is usually just “Protestant”, not “Conservative Protestant”).

**Fix**
- Reconstruct **exactly** the paper’s Conservative Protestant measure (often based on GSS `DENOM` + sometimes `FUND`/`BORNAGAIN`/`RELTRAD` style recodes depending on year).
- If you can’t reproduce the exact Bryson coding, you should not expect coefficient agreement.

---

### A3. “Hispanic (proxy from ETHNIC)” is not guaranteed to match Bryson
- **Generated:** “Hispanic proxy from ETHNIC”
- **True:** “Hispanic” is an explicit independent variable in Table 2.

**Fix**
- Use the same variable Bryson used (likely a direct Hispanic identifier, or a specific GSS race/ethnicity variable available that year).
- Ensure race categories are mutually exclusive:
  - White is the reference, and “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race” are dummies.

---

### A4. Income definition mismatch risk
- **Generated:** `income_pc = REALINC/HOMPOP`
- **True:** “Household income per capita” is reported, but Bryson’s precise construction may differ (e.g., equivalence scale, handling of top-codes, inflation adjustment year, missing treatment).

**Fix**
- Confirm:
  - exactly which income variable (REALINC vs. nominal)
  - exactly which household size variable
  - treatment of zeros/missing
  - any transformations (log, etc.—Table 2 says standardized coefficients, but standardization can be applied to raw or transformed variables)

---

### A5. Dependent variables appear re-created from microdata but don’t match paper’s DV construction/sample
- **Generated:** DV labels match conceptually, but the model N’s are tiny (261/259), and the descriptive N’s are ~1100.
- **True:** N is **644** and **605** in the regressions.

**Fix**
- Your DV creation or listwise deletion is not aligned with Bryson’s:
  - Make sure each DV is the **count** of disliked genres (0–6, 0–12), using the same “dislike” threshold and the same genre list.
  - Then apply the same missing-data rules as the paper (likely listwise deletion across all predictors + DV, but not collapsing N to 261).

---

## B) Coefficients and significance mismatches (variable-by-variable)

Important: Table 2 reports **standardized betas** only (no SEs). Your generated table also reports standardized betas, so direct comparison is valid.

### Model 1 mismatches (DV = minority-linked 6)

| Variable | Generated β (sig) | True β (sig) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.129* | 0.130** | **significance wrong** (should be ** not *) |
| Education | -0.266*** | -0.175*** | **coefficient too large in magnitude** |
| Income pc | -0.008 | -0.037 | **too close to 0** |
| Occ prestige | 0.053 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.036 | -0.057 | magnitude differs (sign matches) |
| Age | 0.171** | 0.163*** | **significance wrong** (*** expected) |
| Black | -0.160* | -0.132*** | **significance wrong** and magnitude differs |
| Hispanic | -0.041 | -0.058 | differs |
| Other race | -0.015 | -0.017 | close (ok-ish) |
| Cons Protestant | 0.116 | 0.063 | differs a lot |
| No religion | dropped | 0.057 | **missing** |
| Southern | -0.039 | 0.024 | **wrong sign** |

**How to fix Model 1 coefficient mismatches**
These are not rounding errors; they indicate **different model/data**. To match:
1. Use Bryson’s **exact sample** (GSS years used, inclusion criteria).
2. Use **exact DV coding** and genre set.
3. Use **exact predictor coding** (especially religion and region).
4. Use standardized betas computed the same way (OLS on raw variables, then standardize; or pre-standardize all variables excluding dummies—confirm your approach).

### Model 2 mismatches (DV = remaining 12)

| Variable | Generated β (sig) | True β (sig) | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.019 | 0.080 | **wrong sign and magnitude** |
| Education | -0.177* | -0.242*** | **too small** and **significance wrong** |
| Income pc | -0.079 | -0.065 | somewhat close (but your N is wrong so still not matching) |
| Occ prestige | -0.080 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.086 | -0.070 | differs |
| Age | 0.118 | 0.126** | **missing significance** |
| Black | 0.068 | 0.042 | differs |
| Hispanic | -0.058 | -0.029 | differs |
| Other race | 0.112 | 0.047 | too large |
| Cons Protestant | 0.116 | 0.048 | too large |
| No religion | dropped | 0.024 | **missing** |
| Southern | 0.134* | 0.069 | too large (and significance likely wrong) |

**How to fix Model 2 coefficient mismatches**
Same root causes, plus a strong hint: **your racism effect flips sign**, which almost certainly means you are not using the same DV, not using the same sample, or have reverse-coded either racism or “dislike” for Model 2.

Concrete checks:
- Confirm higher DV = *more dislikes* (count of disliked genres), not “likes”.
- Confirm racism scale direction matches Bryson (higher = more racist).
- Confirm you did not reverse-code some genre items only in the 12-genre index.

## C) Fit statistics, constants, and sample size mismatches

### C1. Regression N (big mismatch)
- **Generated:** Model 1 N=261; Model 2 N=259 (but descriptives show N>1000).
- **True:** Model 1 N=644; Model 2 N=605.

**Fix**
- Your regression is using a **much smaller listwise-complete subset** than Bryson’s.
- Align missing-data handling with the paper:
  - If Bryson used listwise deletion, you should still end up near 644/605, not ~260.
  - So likely you introduced additional variables/constraints (or mistakenly filtered) that the paper did not.

---

### C2. R² and Adjusted R² (do not match)
- **Generated:** R² 0.182 / Adj 0.145 (Model 1); R² 0.152 / Adj 0.114 (Model 2)
- **True:** R² 0.145 / Adj 0.129 (Model 1); R² 0.147 / Adj 0.130 (Model 2)

**Fix**
- Once you match the sample and covariate coding, R² should move toward the paper’s values.
- Also ensure you’re running **OLS with the same weighting** (if Bryson used survey weights and you didn’t—or vice versa—R² and betas will differ).

---

### C3. Constant/intercept mismatch
- **Generated:** Constant 2.647 (Model 1), 5.328 (Model 2)
- **True:** Constant 2.415 (Model 1), 7.860 (Model 2)

**Fix**
- Intercepts depend on the **unstandardized** DV scale and covariate coding/reference categories.
- If you match:
  - DV construction,
  - dummy reference categories,
  - sample,
then intercepts should align much more closely. Your Model 2 intercept being far lower than 7.860 is consistent with “not the same DV” or “not the same reference coding”.

---

## D) Interpretation/reporting mismatches

### D1. Significance stars do not match the paper’s stars
- **Generated:** uses `*`, `**`, `***`, but many variables have different stars than Table 2 (racism M1; age M1; black M1; education M2; age M2, etc.).
- **True:** stars are from Bryson’s reported tests on her sample/model.

**Fix**
- Don’t try to “force” stars; they will match only if the **model and sample match**.
- Also ensure you use **two-tailed tests** as noted in the table.

---

### D2. The generated output implicitly suggests standard errors exist/are relevant—but Table 2 has none
- **Generated request:** “mismatch in … standard errors”
- **True:** Table 2 does **not** report SEs.

**Fix**
- If your goal is to match the table, do not present SEs as something to compare against Table 2.
- If you still want SEs for transparency, label them as “computed from replication data; not reported in Bryson (1996)”.

---

## Summary: what you must change to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1. **Use the correct dataset and years** Bryson used (GSS waves) and reproduce her **case selection**.
2. Rebuild both DVs to match the paper exactly:
   - exact genre lists (6 vs 12),
   - exact “dislike” coding threshold,
   - exact handling of missing responses.
3. Recode key predictors to match the paper:
   - correct racism scale direction and item set,
   - correct “Conservative Protestant” classification,
   - correct “No religion” (and ensure it varies),
   - correct race/ethnicity dummies and reference category,
   - correct region coding for “Southern”.
4. Apply the same **missing-data strategy** so regression N becomes **644** and **605**.
5. Confirm whether Bryson used **weights**; match that choice.

If you share the code you used to construct (i) the DVs, (ii) racism score, (iii) the religion dummies, and (iv) the filters that lead to N≈261, I can pinpoint exactly which step is causing the massive N drop and the sign flips.
