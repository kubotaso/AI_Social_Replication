============================================================

Below is a *field-by-field* audit of the Generated Results against Bryson (1996) Table 2 (“True Results”). I flag **every mismatch** in (a) variable presence/name, (b) coefficient value, (c) significance markers, and (d) model fit / N / constants / interpretation. Then I explain **how to fix** the generated analysis so it can match the published table.

---

## 1) Fundamental specification/reporting problems (must fix first)

### 1.1 Generated output mixes *standardized betas* with an *unstandardized intercept*
- **True table:** reports **standardized OLS coefficients** (betas) for predictors, **and** it prints a “Constant”.
- **Generated table:** labels coefficients as `Std_Beta` but also prints `Constant` and explicitly labels it “intercept (unstandardized)”.

**Why this is a mismatch**
- In a fully standardized regression (DV and predictors standardized), the intercept should be ~0.  
- Bryson’s table is best understood as: predictors shown as standardized betas, but the constant corresponds to the **unstandardized DV scale** regression (common in published tables: betas for slopes + raw intercept).

**Fix**
- Decide on one consistent reporting format that matches the paper:
  - **Option A (match Bryson):** report **standardized betas for slopes**, but compute/report the **unstandardized intercept** from the unstandardized model (and do not call it “standardized”). Clearly label columns: `Beta (standardized)` for predictors, `Constant (unstandardized)`.
  - **Option B:** standardize DV and all IVs and then report everything standardized (intercept≈0). This will **not** match Bryson’s printed constant values, so Option A is what you want.

### 1.2 Generated results include standard errors, but the true table has none
- **True:** “does not report standard errors.”
- **Generated:** user asks to compare SEs, but none are actually shown in the generated tables; still, the *analysis framework* implies SE comparison.

**Fix**
- Do **not** invent or “reconstruct” SEs. If you want to match the paper, omit SE columns entirely, or compute them from the original data (not possible from the table alone).

### 1.3 Sample definition mismatch (N differs substantially)
- **True N:** Model 1 = 644; Model 2 = 605  
- **Generated N:** Model 1 = 549; Model 2 = 507

**Fix**
- Your analytic sample selection is not replicating Bryson’s:
  - Don’t use “strict complete” listwise deletion across all included variables if Bryson didn’t, or you are using different missingness rules.
  - Ensure the same source dataset/year/wave and the same coding of “don’t know,” “refused,” etc.
  - Verify DV construction and whether respondents missing *any* genre item are dropped; Bryson may have allowed partial genre information (or used imputation/scale rules).
  - Recreate Bryson’s exclusions exactly (e.g., age range, race categories, etc.).

### 1.4 Model fit mismatch (R² / Adjusted R²)
- **True:** R² = 0.145 (M1), 0.147 (M2); Adj R² = 0.129 (M1), 0.130 (M2)
- **Generated:** R² = 0.1330 (M1), 0.1200 (M2); Adj R² = 0.1153 (M1), 0.1005 (M2)

**Fix**
- Once you fix the sample (N) and variable coding, R² should move closer. If it doesn’t, the DV/IV scaling differs (see below).

---

## 2) Variable-by-variable mismatches (names, coefficients, significance)

I list each variable and compare **Generated vs True** for both models.

### 2.1 Racism score
- **Model 1:** Generated = **0.131833** ** (matches sign, close magnitude) vs True = **0.130** **  
  - Minor numeric discrepancy; could be rounding/data differences.
- **Model 2:** Generated = **-0.002233** (≈0, negative) vs True = **0.080** (positive, not significant)
  - **Mismatch:** sign and magnitude.

**Fix**
- Check that you used the *same racism scale construction* (item selection, reverse coding, standardization).  
- Ensure you did not accidentally standardize in a way that changes interpretation (e.g., using a different sample for z-scores).  
- Most importantly: fix the **analytic sample** and the **DV** construction; racism effects are sensitive to both.

### 2.2 Education
- **Model 1:** Generated = **-0.180139*** vs True = **-0.175***  
  - Close, small mismatch.
- **Model 2:** Generated = **-0.194316*** vs True = **-0.242***  
  - **Mismatch:** magnitude too small (less negative).

**Fix**
- Confirm education coding (years vs categories transformed to years).  
- Confirm standardization method.  
- Sample mismatch likely explains the attenuated coefficient in Model 2.

### 2.3 Household income per capita
- **Model 1:** Generated = **+0.008961** vs True = **-0.037**
  - **Mismatch:** sign (positive vs negative).
- **Model 2:** Generated = **-0.035654** vs True = **-0.065**
  - Same sign but too small in magnitude.

**Fix**
- Verify you truly have **per capita** household income (household income divided by household size), and that it’s coded/trimmed similarly.
- Ensure income is not logged if Bryson used raw (or vice versa).
- Recheck standardization and missing data handling (income often has high missingness; listwise deletion can strongly change coefficients).

### 2.4 Occupational prestige
- **Model 1:** Generated = **-0.019019** vs True = **-0.020** (very close)
- **Model 2:** Generated = **-0.012431** vs True = **+0.005**
  - **Mismatch:** sign (negative vs slightly positive).

**Fix**
- Verify the prestige scale (e.g., Duncan SEI / NORC prestige) and treatment of non-employed / missing occupations.  
- Bryson may have assigned prestige differently for nonworkers; your handling may induce sign changes.

### 2.5 Female
- **Model 1:** Generated = **-0.071658** vs True = **-0.057**
  - Mismatch in magnitude.
- **Model 2:** Generated = **-0.069205** vs True = **-0.070**
  - Essentially matches.

**Fix**
- Mostly sample/coding; ensure female=1 coding matches Bryson.

### 2.6 Age
- **Model 1:** Generated = **0.156851*** vs True = **0.163*** (close)
- **Model 2:** Generated = **0.119317** ** vs True = **0.126** ** (close)

**Fix**
- Minor: likely rounding or sample differences. Still, after fixing N, it should align better.

### 2.7 Black
- **Model 1:** Generated = **-0.141030** ** vs True = **-0.132***  
  - **Mismatch:** significance level (Generated **, True ***), and magnitude slightly.
- **Model 2:** Generated = **0.066914** (ns) vs True = **0.042** (ns)
  - magnitude mismatch.

**Fix**
- Standard errors/significance will change once sample and coding match.  
- Also check race reference group and whether “Other race” and “Hispanic” are mutually exclusive vs overlapping. Bryson’s table treats them as separate dummies with (implicitly) White non-Hispanic as reference.

### 2.8 Hispanic (this is a major discrepancy)
- **True:** Hispanic is included in both models:
  - Model 1: **-0.058**
  - Model 2: **-0.029**
- **Generated:** Hispanic = **NaN** (“not available in provided extract”) in both models

**Fix**
- Include the Hispanic dummy in the regression. This is non-negotiable if you want to match Table 2.
- Ensure coding matches Bryson (Hispanic as ethnicity; race dummies likely for non-Hispanic groups). If you coded Hispanic as part of race categories, you may have omitted it inadvertently due to collinearity.

### 2.9 Other race
- **Model 1:** Generated = **+0.010867** vs True = **-0.017**
  - **Mismatch:** sign.
- **Model 2:** Generated = **0.076128** vs True = **0.047**
  - mismatch in magnitude.

**Fix**
- Again suggests race/ethnicity coding differences (and/or small, heterogeneous “other” group sensitive to sample).  
- Align race coding with Bryson’s: Black, Hispanic, Other race dummies with White (non-Hispanic) omitted.

### 2.10 Conservative Protestant
- **Model 1:** Generated = **0.083766** vs True = **0.063**
  - mismatch.
- **Model 2:** Generated = **0.101269*** vs True = **0.048** (no star)
  - **Mismatch:** magnitude and significance.

**Fix**
- Verify definition: Bryson’s “Conservative Protestant” is typically a denominational tradition classification, not simply “attends church” or “born again.”  
- Misclassification can inflate coefficients and significance.
- Also check: you might be using a different reference religious category set.

### 2.11 No religion
- **Model 1:** Generated = **0.068263** vs True = **0.057** (close)
- **Model 2:** Generated = **0.018895** vs True = **0.024** (close)

**Fix**
- Minor; should improve after sample alignment.

### 2.12 Southern
- **Model 1:** Generated = **0.026711** vs True = **0.024** (close)
- **Model 2:** Generated = **0.075385** vs True = **0.069** (close)

**Fix**
- Minor.

---

## 3) Constants mismatch (both models)

- **Model 1 constant:** Generated **2.461148*** vs True **2.415***  
  - mismatch in value (but same general scale).
- **Model 2 constant:** Generated **4.957739*** vs True **7.860**  
  - **large mismatch**.

**Fix**
- First, stop labeling it as standardized if you’re mixing metrics.
- Second, this large Model 2 discrepancy strongly indicates your **DV construction** for Model 2 does not match Bryson’s (different count range, different handling of missing items, different genre list, etc.). If DV2 is on a 0–12 count like Bryson’s, an intercept of ~7.86 is plausible; ~4.96 suggests a different mean/scale.

---

## 4) Interpretation mismatches implied by the generated tables

### 4.1 “Hispanic not available” is an interpretive error
- The true table includes Hispanic; treating it as missing changes substantive interpretation because Model 1 DV is explicitly about “minority-linked genres,” including Latin music.

**Fix**
- Add Hispanic variable and ensure the “minority-linked genres” DV is constructed exactly as in the paper.

### 4.2 Wrong conclusion about racism in Model 2
- **Generated:** racism ~0 (negative tiny) suggests “no relationship.”
- **True:** racism is **+0.080** (still not significant, but directionally positive). The sign flip is interpretively important.

**Fix**
- Correct DV2 and racism scale, plus sample replication, until coefficient direction matches.

---

## 5) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson (1996)

1. **Rebuild both DVs exactly**
   - Model 1 DV: *count of dislike* for exactly the 6 genres listed (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin).  
   - Model 2 DV: *count of dislike* for the remaining 12 genres (verify the exact list from the paper).
   - Match Bryson’s “dislike” threshold (e.g., “dislike”/“hate” vs lower than midpoint).
   - Apply the same missing-data rule Bryson used for the DV (e.g., allow partial and rescale vs listwise drop).

2. **Recreate covariates with Bryson’s coding**
   - Racism score: same items, same coding direction, same scaling.
   - Education: same unit (likely years).
   - Household income per capita: confirm per-capita computation, trimming/top-coding, inflation adjustment.
   - Occupational prestige: same prestige scale and treatment of missing occupation.
   - Race/ethnicity: include **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Other race** dummies with White non-Hispanic reference.
   - Religion: denominational tradition method for “Conservative Protestant,” plus “No religion” dummy, with correct reference.
   - Southern: same Census region definition.

3. **Replicate sample inclusion/exclusion**
   - Target N should be 644 (M1) and 605 (M2). If you cannot get these Ns, you are not using the same missingness rules or base sample.

4. **Run OLS on unstandardized variables, then report standardized betas for slopes**
   - Compute standardized beta for each predictor as:  
     \[
     \beta_j = b_j \times \frac{s_{X_j}}{s_Y}
     \]
   - Report the **unstandardized intercept** from the unstandardized model (to match Bryson’s constant style).

5. **Report only what the paper reports**
   - Do not add SEs/t-stats unless you’re reproducing from the original microdata (and then be explicit it’s your replication output, not the printed table).

---

If you want, paste (a) your DV coding rules (how “dislike” is defined), (b) the exact 12 “remaining genres” list you used, and (c) how you coded Hispanic vs race, and I can pinpoint which one(s) are mathematically sufficient to explain the biggest sign flips (income M1, other race M1, racism M2, prestige M2, and the Model 2 constant).
