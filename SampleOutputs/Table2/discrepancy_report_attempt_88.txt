Score: 0/100
============================================================

### 1) The biggest structural problem: you’re not reproducing Table 2 at all
**True Table 2 reports standardized coefficients only (plus stars). It does *not* report standard errors, t, or p.**  
Your “generated results” are a full regression output (unstandardized b, SEs, t, p, and standardized betas). That is **not directly comparable** to Bryson’s Table 2.

**Fix**
- If the goal is to “match Table 2,” output **only standardized betas with the paper’s star cutoffs**.
- Remove/ignore `std_err`, `t`, and `p_value` in the comparison, because the paper doesn’t provide them.
- If you must compute stars, you can only do so from your own p-values (they will not be verifiable against the PDF unless you also reproduce the same design/weighting/specification and then accept minor numerical differences).

---

### 2) Sample size and fit statistics do not match (major mismatch)
**True results**
- Model 1: **N=644**, R²=.145, Adj R²=.129
- Model 2: **N=605**, R²=.147, Adj R²=.130

**Generated**
- ModelA_fit: **n=203**, R²=0.165, Adj R²=0.117
- ModelB_fit: **n=197**, R²=0.196, Adj R²=0.148

These are not small discrepancies—they indicate you are using a completely different analytic sample (likely due to missing data handling, wrong year(s), wrong dataset, or accidentally restricting to a subset such as “genres module respondents” incorrectly).

**Fix**
- Use **GSS 1993** (the paper’s year) and the same module/variables.
- Replicate the paper’s **listwise deletion rules** (or whatever missing-data strategy the author used). Your N suggests you’re dropping far more cases than the paper.
- Ensure your DV construction matches the paper’s constructed indices (see next section), because bad DV construction can also reduce N.
- If the paper used weights (common in GSS analyses), apply the same weighting scheme; otherwise R² and coefficients may drift.

---

### 3) Dependent variables are likely constructed differently (or mislabeled)
**True DVs**
- Model 1 DV: **count (or index) of “disliked” among 6 minority-associated genres** (Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin)
- Model 2 DV: **count (or index) of “disliked” among the remaining 12 genres**

**Generated labels**
- `dislike_minority6_genres` (nonmissing_n shown as 1134 in Diagnostics)
- `dislike_other12_genres` (nonmissing_n shown as 1057)
…but the regression Ns are 203/197, implying a *massive* loss after adding predictors.

Also, your intercepts (2.84 and 7.12) are in the rough ballpark of counts, but the **true constants are 2.415 and 7.860** (and note: the paper reports a starred constant for Model 1).

**Fix**
- Verify DV coding matches Bryson:
  - Same set of genres in each index.
  - Same “dislike” threshold/coding (e.g., binary dislike vs ordinal).
  - Same handling of “don’t know,” “not asked,” “inapplicable.”
- After constructing the two DV indices, check that **the analytic N after merging predictors is ~644 and ~605**, not ~200.

### 4) Variable name mismatches / variable definition mismatches
The “true results” variable names are conceptual labels (“Education”, “Age”, etc.). Your generated tables have **no variable-name column**, so we can’t map rows reliably. That itself is a discrepancy: you can’t claim you matched coefficients without row labels.

However, your Diagnostics list suggests you used:
- `education_years` (ok in concept)
- `hh_income_per_capita` (may differ from paper’s exact construction)
- `occ_prestige` (ok in concept, but could be different scale)
- `female`, `age_years`, `black`, `hispanic_flag`, `other_race`, `cons_protestant`, `no_religion`, `southern`, `racism_score`

**Fix**
- Add a **variable column** to ModelA_table/ModelB_table and ensure ordering matches the paper.
- Confirm operationalizations:
  - Paper’s “Education” may be years or degree categories—must match exactly.
  - “Household income per capita” must match the paper’s transformation/definition (per-capita from household income; treatment of top-codes, missing).
  - Race/ethnicity and religion dummies must match the paper’s coding and reference categories.

---

### 5) Coefficient mismatches (standardized betas + signs) by model
Because your tables lack row names, the only direct comparable summary is your **Paper_style_betas** column. Those values do not match the true table.

#### Model 1 (true vs generated)
True Model 1 betas:
- Racism **0.130** (**)  
- Education **-0.175** (***)  
- Income -0.037  
- Occ prestige -0.020  
- Female -0.057  
- Age **0.163** (***)  
- Black **-0.132** (***)  
- Hispanic -0.058  
- Other race -0.017  
- Cons Prot 0.063  
- No religion 0.057  
- Southern 0.024  

Generated ModelA has (from Paper_style_betas, ModelA_beta):  
`0.152* , -0.149 , 0.075 , -0.252** , -0.032 , 0.023 , -0.033 , (blank) , 0.006 , -0.006 , 0.131 , -0.015`

Mismatches (even ignoring ordering problems):
- Racism should be **+0.130** and significant **; you appear to have a +0.131 with no stars** somewhere, but also a +0.152* elsewhere. This suggests either **wrong mapping of rows** or wrong model.
- Education should be **-0.175***. You have **-0.252** (with **), or **-0.149** (no stars). Neither matches magnitude or star level.
- Age should be **+0.163***. You have **+0.152*** (close-ish but star level differs) and **+0.075** (too small).
- Black should be **-0.132***. You have **-0.149** (no stars) which misses the ***.
- Conservative Protestant should be **+0.063 (ns)**; you have **-0.006** or **+0.006** (wrong sign/magnitude).
- Southern should be **+0.024 (ns)**; you have **-0.015** (wrong sign).

**Fix**
- First fix the **variable mapping** by labeling rows.
- Then fix the **data/specification** so the standardized betas align (see Sections 2–4). Right now, the pattern of signs and significance doesn’t resemble the paper.

#### Model 2 (true vs generated)
True Model 2 betas:
- Racism 0.080 (ns)  
- Education -0.242***  
- Income -0.065  
- Occ prestige 0.005  
- Female -0.070  
- Age 0.126**  
- Black 0.042  
- Hispanic -0.029  
- Other race 0.047  
- Cons Prot 0.048  
- No religion 0.024  
- Southern 0.069  

Generated ModelB_beta values include:
`-0.005, 0.064, 0.117, -0.260**, -0.087, -0.069, -0.060, (blank), -0.094, 0.159*, -0.022, 0.200**`

Clear mismatches:
- Racism should be **positive (0.080)**; you have **negative (-0.005 or -0.022)**.
- Age should be **+0.126** with **; you have **+0.117 (no stars)** (close in magnitude but not sig) and also **+0.159*** (too large).
- Education should be **-0.242***; you have **-0.260** with ** (star level too low).
- Southern should be **+0.069**; you have **+0.200** (way too large) or negative values depending on mapping.
- Several signs differ from the paper (e.g., income should be negative; your candidate negatives exist but mapping is unclear).

**Fix**
- Same as Model 1: fix mapping, sample/spec, and any weighting. Also confirm you’re using the correct DV (“12 remaining genres”) and not mixing DVs.

---

### 6) “Stars” thresholds don’t match the paper’s thresholds
Paper uses:
- * p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001 (two-tailed)

Your tables use stars but **never show `***` anywhere**, which is suspicious given the true table has multiple `***` (Education, Age, Black in Model 1; Education in Model 2).

**Fix**
- Implement the paper’s star rules exactly, including `***` for p < .001.
- But note: even if you implement this, you still won’t match unless the underlying regression matches (N/spec/weights/coding).

---

### 7) Internal output issues in the generated tables (NaN row)
Both ModelA_table and ModelB_table contain a row with:
- `beta_std = NaN`, `b_unstd = 0`, `std_err=0`, `t=NaN`, `p=NaN`

That indicates a broken coefficient row (often caused by a constant mistakenly included twice, a perfectly collinear predictor, or an empty factor level).

**Fix**
- Check for perfect multicollinearity / dummy-variable trap (e.g., including all race dummies plus intercept; including both `female` and `male`; etc.).
- Ensure categorical variables are coded with a **reference category** and do not include all categories simultaneously.
- Ensure the intercept is included once.

---

## What you should do to make the generated analysis match the paper
1. **Rebuild DVs exactly** as Bryson’s “number of genres disliked” for the specified sets (6 minority-associated; 12 remaining).
2. Restrict to **GSS 1993** and the correct respondents/items.
3. Apply the paper’s **missing data handling** to recover **N≈644 and N≈605**.
4. Verify predictor coding matches the paper (education, per-capita income, prestige, race/ethnicity, religion, region, etc.).
5. Compute **standardized coefficients (beta)** and present them in the same order as Table 2.
6. Apply the paper’s star cutoffs (*, **, ***) and **do not report SEs** as “from Table 2.”
7. Remove the **NaN coefficient row** by fixing collinearity/dummy coding.

If you paste the model formula you used (predictor order + how you coded each variable + how you constructed the two DVs), I can produce a precise row-by-row mapping of “this generated row corresponds to X in the paper and is wrong by Y,” but with the current unlabeled coefficient rows, some mismatches are inherently unresolvable.
