## 1) Variable-name mismatches (and missing variables)

### A. **Hispanic is missing entirely in the generated output**
- **True Table 2 includes:** `Hispanic` in *both* Model 1 and Model 2.
- **Generated tables include:** `Other race` but **no** `Hispanic`.

**Fix**
- Add a `hispanic` dummy (1 = Hispanic, 0 = otherwise) with **White (non-Hispanic)** as the omitted reference category.
- Then include `hispanic` in both regressions and in the coefficient tables, in the same position/order as Table 2.

---

### B. Race-category definition likely wrong (because “Other race” sign differs in Model 1)
- **True Model 1:** `Other race = -0.017`
- **Generated Model 1:** `Other race = +0.010867`

That sign flip is a red flag that your “other_race” dummy is not defined the same way as Bryson’s table (e.g., you may be coding *Hispanic into other_race*, or using a different reference group).

**Fix**
- Ensure three mutually exclusive dummies with **White (non-Hispanic)** omitted:
  - `black` (non-Hispanic Black)
  - `hispanic` (any race Hispanic, or Hispanic ethnicity—match the paper’s coding)
  - `other_race` (non-Hispanic, non-White, non-Black; i.e., “Other”)
- Verify: no overlap, and everyone is in exactly one race/ethnicity category (except the omitted White group).

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (by model and variable)

### Model 1 (DV: dislike of 6 “minority-linked” genres)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.131833** | 0.130** | close (rounding), OK |
| Education | -0.180139*** | -0.175*** | small numeric mismatch |
| Household income per capita | **+0.008961** | **-0.037** | **wrong sign + magnitude** |
| Occupational prestige | -0.019019 | -0.020 | close, OK |
| Female | -0.071658 | -0.057 | mismatch |
| Age | 0.156851*** | 0.163*** | mismatch |
| Black | -0.141030** | -0.132*** | mismatch **and significance differs** |
| Hispanic | missing | -0.058 | missing variable |
| Other race | +0.010867 | -0.017 | wrong sign |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.083766 | 0.063 | mismatch |
| No religion | 0.068263 | 0.057 | mismatch |
| Southern | 0.026711 | 0.024 | close, OK |
| Constant | 2.461148*** | 2.415*** | mismatch |

**Big problems to fix for Model 1**
1) Income sign is wrong (positive vs negative).  
2) Missing Hispanic and likely mis-coded race dummies.  
3) N and R² don’t match (see Section 4), which guarantees coefficients will differ.

---

### Model 2 (DV: dislike of the 12 remaining genres)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | **-0.002233** | **0.080** | **very wrong (sign and magnitude)** |
| Education | -0.194316*** | -0.242*** | notable mismatch |
| Household income per capita | -0.035654 | -0.065 | mismatch |
| Occupational prestige | -0.012431 | +0.005 | wrong sign |
| Female | -0.069205 | -0.070 | essentially matches |
| Age | 0.119317** | 0.126** | small mismatch |
| Black | 0.066914 | 0.042 | mismatch |
| Hispanic | missing | -0.029 | missing variable |
| Other race | 0.076128 | 0.047 | mismatch |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.101269* | 0.048 | mismatch **and significance differs** |
| No religion | 0.018895 | 0.024 | mismatch |
| Southern | 0.075385 | 0.069 | close |
| Constant | 4.957739 | 7.860 | large mismatch |

**Big problems to fix for Model 2**
1) Racism coefficient is completely off (true is +0.080; generated is ~0). That usually indicates you are not using the same **DV construction**, **sample**, and/or **standardization** procedure as the paper.  
2) Occupational prestige sign differs.  
3) Missing Hispanic again.

---

## 3) “Standard errors” mismatch: generated results don’t even report them
Your prompt asks to compare *standard errors*, but:

- **True Table 2:** explicitly *does not report SEs*.
- **Generated output:** also does not include SEs (only coefficients and stars).

So there is no SE-to-SE mismatch to check; instead, the mismatch is **expectation/claim**: you cannot validate SEs against the paper because they are not in Table 2.

**Fix**
- If you want the generated analysis to “match” Table 2, **omit SEs** and report standardized betas + stars only.
- If you still want SEs, you must get them from the original dataset/output (or reproduce them), but you cannot compare them to Table 2.

---

## 4) Model fit and sample-size mismatches (these guarantee coefficient mismatches)

### N mismatch
- **True N:** Model 1 = 644; Model 2 = 605  
- **Generated N:** Model 1 = 549; Model 2 = 507

That’s not a small difference; it implies different missing-data handling, different variable availability, or a different dataset/sample.

**Fix**
- Reproduce the paper’s analytic sample rules:
  - Use the same survey/year and population restrictions as Bryson.
  - Use the same listwise deletion rules (very likely listwise deletion on all variables in the model).
  - Ensure all required variables exist for those cases (including Hispanic).

### R² mismatch
- **True R²:** Model 1 = 0.145; Model 2 = 0.147  
- **Generated R²:** Model 1 = 0.133; Model 2 = 0.120

**Fix**
- Once you correct: (a) DV construction, (b) standardization, (c) sample size, and (d) covariate coding, R² should move toward the published values.

---

## 5) Interpretation / labeling mismatches (what the coefficients mean)

### A. You label the coefficients as “Std_Beta” but the constant is unstandardized
- **True Table 2:** calls them standardized OLS coefficients; the constant is still shown (but it is not a standardized beta in the usual sense).
- **Generated:** mixes “Std_Beta” tables with “Constant intercept (unstandardized)”.

This is mostly a reporting inconsistency, but it matters for “matching”.

**Fix**
- Present tables like the paper:
  - A column called “Coefficient” with standardized betas for predictors.
  - Include “Constant” separately (acknowledging it’s the intercept from the model; not a standardized effect).
  - Do **not** label the entire column “Std_Beta” if it contains the constant.

### B. DV definition must match exactly (count of dislikes)
Your generated DVs appear as:
- `dv1_minority6` (0–6)
- `dv2_remaining12` (0–12)

That matches the *idea*, but the coefficient mismatches (especially racism in Model 2 and constant in Model 2) strongly suggest your dislike coding differs (e.g., threshold for “dislike,” missing genres, recoding of neutral responses, etc.).

**Fix**
- Recreate the DV exactly as Bryson did:
  - Same set of genres in each DV.
  - Same rule for what counts as “dislike” (e.g., “dislike” vs “dislike a lot”; whether “neutral” is counted; treatment of “don’t know”; etc.).
  - Same handling of missing genre ratings (likely listwise or defined-count rules).

---

## 6) Significance-star mismatches

Examples:
- **Model 1 Black:** generated `**`, true `***`
- **Model 2 Conservative Protestant:** generated `*`, true no star

Because Table 2 does not provide SEs, these stars come from the author’s internal t-tests. Your stars will not match unless:
1) coefficients match closely, and
2) N/sample and model variance match closely, and
3) you replicate the same testing approach (OLS assumptions, two-tailed p-values).

**Fix**
- Don’t try to “tune” stars directly. Fix the *upstream replication* (sample + coding + DV + standardization). Stars will then align.

---

## 7) What to change so the generated analysis matches Table 2 (priority order)

1) **Use the same analytic sample (N=644 and N=605).**  
   - Implement the paper’s inclusion criteria and listwise deletion on the exact model variables.

2) **Fix race/ethnicity variables: add Hispanic and correct the reference group.**  
   - Include `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race`, omit White.

3) **Rebuild the two DVs exactly per the paper’s coding of “dislike.”**  
   - Same genres, same dislike threshold, same missing handling.

4) **Ensure coefficients reported are standardized exactly like the paper.**  
   - Standardize predictors and DV the same way (typical: z-score before OLS), or compute standardized betas from unstandardized OLS using SD ratios—match the author’s method.

5) **Re-run OLS and report: coefficients + significance stars, plus R²/Adj R² and N.**  
   - Do not introduce SE columns if your goal is to match Table 2.

If you tell me (a) the dataset you used, (b) how you coded “dislike,” and (c) how you standardized variables, I can pinpoint which specific step is creating the biggest departures (the racism coefficient in Model 2 is the clearest diagnostic).
