Score: 18/100
============================================================

## 1) Variable-name / definition mismatches

### A. **“Age” vs `age_years`**
- **Generated:** labels “Age” but analytic sample column is `age_years`.
- **True table:** “Age”.
- **Fix:** purely cosmetic unless you accidentally used a different age variable. Ensure the model uses the same age measure as Bryson (likely years). Then harmonize labels:
  - either rename `age_years` → `Age` in output tables, or
  - map labels: `age_years` displayed as “Age”.

### B. Race dummies / reference category not stated
- **Generated:** includes `black`, `hispanic`, `other_race` (and implicitly White omitted).
- **True table:** “Black”, “Hispanic”, “Other race” (same idea).
- **Fix:** confirm reference group is White in both models; print that in table notes. If your coding differs (e.g., “Other race” includes Hispanics in some datasets), recode to match the paper’s mutually exclusive categories.

### C. Religious category label mismatch (`cons_prot`, `no_religion`)
- **Generated:** `cons_prot`, `no_religion` but displayed as “Conservative Protestant”, “No religion” (fine).
- **Fix:** verify these dummies match Bryson’s categories and reference group (likely non–conservative Protestants / other religions). If reference differs, coefficients will not match.

### D. DV construction / sample mismatch (major)
- **Generated DV names:** `dv1_minority6`, `dv2_remaining12`; **N=438 and 406**.
- **True table:** N=644 (Model 1) and N=605 (Model 2).
- **Fix:** your DVs and/or missing-data handling do not reproduce Bryson’s construction. To match the paper you must:
  1. Use the *same survey/year and weighting* as Bryson (GSS 1993 module, likely).
  2. Recreate the *exact count indices*:  
     - Model 1 DV = count of “dislike” across **6 minority-linked genres**.  
     - Model 2 DV = count of “dislike” across **12 other genres**.
  3. Match Bryson’s list of genres and “dislike” coding threshold (e.g., dislike vs like vs neutral; treatment of “never heard”; DK/NA).
  4. Apply Bryson’s *case inclusion rules* (listwise deletion vs item-specific; whether “never heard” is excluded or treated as missing/0).
  5. Use the *same covariate availability rules* so that N aligns (~644/605). Your N is far smaller, which alone guarantees coefficient differences.

## 2) Coefficient mismatches (every variable)

Below I list **Generated vs True** for each model and the mismatch.

### Model 1 (Minority-linked genres: 6)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | 0.128** | 0.130** | slightly low |
| Education | -0.207*** | -0.175*** | too negative |
| Household income per capita | +0.033 | -0.037 | **wrong sign** |
| Occupational prestige | +0.009 | -0.020 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.072 | -0.057 | more negative |
| Age | 0.145** | 0.163*** | too small; sig level differs |
| Black | -0.156** | -0.132*** | too negative; sig differs |
| Hispanic | -0.059 | -0.058 | essentially matches |
| Other race | -0.000 | -0.017 | too close to 0 |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.098 | 0.063 | too large |
| No religion | 0.069 | 0.057 | too large |
| Southern | -0.023 | 0.024 | **wrong sign** |
| Constant | 2.599*** | 2.415*** | too large |

**Key pattern:** multiple sign flips (income, occ prestige, southern) strongly suggest your data, coding, or sample differs from Bryson (not just rounding).

### Model 2 (Remaining genres: 12)

| Variable | Generated | True | Mismatch |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Racism score | -0.031 | 0.080 | **wrong sign** |
| Education | -0.222*** | -0.242*** | not negative enough |
| Household income per capita | -0.032 | -0.065 | too close to 0 |
| Occupational prestige | -0.030 | 0.005 | **wrong sign** |
| Female | -0.078 | -0.070 | slightly too negative |
| Age | 0.109* | 0.126** | too small; sig differs |
| Black | 0.048 | 0.042 | close |
| Hispanic | -0.050 | -0.029 | too negative |
| Other race | 0.078 | 0.047 | too large |
| Conservative Protestant | 0.104 | 0.048 | too large |
| No religion | 0.014 | 0.024 | too small |
| Southern | 0.080 | 0.069 | slightly high |
| Constant | 5.548*** | 7.860 | **far too low** (and Bryson reports no stars here) |

## 3) Standard error mismatches

- **True results:** **no standard errors are reported in Table 2**.
- **Generated results:** also do not show SEs (only coefficients and stars). So there’s **no SE mismatch to compare**.
- **But** your prompt asks to identify SE mismatches: the correct action is to **not invent or imply SEs**. If your pipeline computed SEs internally, that’s fine, but do not claim they come from Bryson (1996) Table 2.

**Fix:** Add a note in generated output: “Standard errors not shown in Bryson (1996) Table 2; significance stars reproduced from the table (if matched).”

---

## 4) Fit statistics mismatches (R², Adj R², N)

### Model 1
- **Generated:** R² = 0.128; Adj R² = 0.103; N = 438  
- **True:** R² = 0.145; Adj R² = 0.129; N = 644  
**Fix:** must replicate sample construction and missing-data rules (see §1D). Also verify whether Bryson uses **weights**; weighted vs unweighted can change R² and coefficients.

### Model 2
- **Generated:** R² = 0.129; Adj R² = 0.102; N = 406  
- **True:** R² = 0.147; Adj R² = 0.130; N = 605  
**Fix:** same as above; plus confirm the 12-genre DV coding matches.

---

## 5) Interpretation / reporting mismatches

### A. Claiming “standardized” while mixing in an unstandardized constant
- **True:** Table reports **standardized OLS coefficients**; constant is still shown (unstandardized intercept) in the table.
- **Generated:** labels “Std_Beta” but includes “Constant … intercept (unstandardized)” (that part is actually fine).
- **Fix:** make it explicit: “Coefficients are standardized betas; constant is unstandardized.”

### B. Significance stars don’t match Bryson’s stars
Examples:
- **Model 1 Age:** Generated ** but True ***  
- **Model 1 Black:** Generated ** but True ***  
- **Model 2 Age:** Generated * but True **  
- **Model 2 Racism:** Generated none but True none (but sign differs, so interpretation differs)
**Fix:** once coefficients and N match, stars should align more closely. Also ensure you use **two-tailed tests** and Bryson’s thresholds (* p<.05, ** p<.01, *** p<.001). If you’re recomputing p-values, they may still differ from the published ones due to rounding/weighting/df choices. If the goal is to “match the table,” you should **not recompute stars**—you should display the stars from the paper only when reproducing the paper exactly, or clearly label them as “recomputed”.

## 6) What to change so the generated analysis matches the paper

To actually match Bryson (1996) Table 2, you need to align **(i) data**, **(ii) coding**, **(iii) estimation choices**, and **(iv) output formatting**:

1. **Use the same dataset and wave/module** as Bryson.
2. **Rebuild both DVs exactly**:
   - same genres in each index,
   - same “dislike” definition,
   - same treatment of “never heard” / missing.
3. **Match independent-variable coding**:
   - racism scale construction and direction,
   - education metric (years? categories?),
   - income per capita transformation (and whether logged),
   - occupational prestige scale used,
   - region dummy (South) definition,
   - religion dummies and reference group,
   - race/ethnicity mutually exclusive with same reference category.
4. **Match sample inclusion / missing data** to get N≈644 and N≈605:
   - likely listwise deletion within each model,
   - consistent handling of missing for genre items.
5. **Match weighting** (if Bryson used weights; many GSS analyses do).
6. **Standardize predictors/outcome appropriately** to produce standardized betas (most software can output standardized coefficients; make sure you standardize in the same way).
7. **Report fit stats exactly as in the table** and do not report SEs as if they were in the paper.

If you want, paste the code (or describe your DV construction and missing-data rules), and I can pinpoint which specific step(s) most plausibly cause the sign flips (income/prestige/southern in Model 1; racism/prestige in Model 2) and the drastic N reduction.
