Score: 13/100
============================================================

### 1) Big conceptual/format mismatches (must fix before coefficient-by-coefficient checks)

#### A. You reported **standard errors and p-values**, but the true table **has no SEs**
- **Generated:** columns include `p_value` and (implicitly) SEs were used to compute stars; `reported` shows stars based on those p-values.
- **True:** Bryson Table 2 reports **standardized coefficients only** (with significance markers), **no SEs**.
- **Fix:**  
  - Remove SE and p-value claims entirely if you are claiming to reproduce *Table 2 from the PDF*.  
  - If you want p-values/SEs, you must (i) obtain the underlying data and (ii) re-estimate the models; then you can report SEs—but you can no longer claim they were “extracted from Table 2”.

#### B. Your sample sizes and fit statistics are wrong (and way too small)
- **Generated fit:**
  - Model A: **N=246**, R²=0.126, Adj R²=0.085
  - Model B: **N=244**, R²=0.176, Adj R²=0.137
- **True:**
  - Model 1: **N=644**, R²=.145, Adj R²=.129
  - Model 2: **N=605**, R²=.147, Adj R²=.130
- **Fix:**  
  - Ensure you are using **GSS 1993** with the same construction of both DVs and predictors as Bryson.  
  - Your “Missingness” table shows huge missingness on `racism_score`, `hispanic`, `cons_protestant` etc., suggesting you either:
    - used the wrong year(s),
    - used different variable codings (e.g., missing recodes),
    - inadvertently restricted the sample (e.g., listwise deletion after additional filters),
    - or constructed the DV from items not available for most respondents.
  - To match Table 2, use **listwise deletion on exactly the variables in the model** and confirm N matches (644 / 605). If it doesn’t, your variable construction/sample is not the same as the paper’s.

#### C. You dropped a predictor that exists in the true model (“No religion”)
- **Generated fit:** `dropped_zero_variance_predictors: No religion` and “No religion” does not appear in Model tables.
- **True table:** “No religion” is included in both models.
- **Fix:**  
  - “No religion” should not be zero-variance in the target sample. This indicates a coding error (e.g., you subsetted to only religious respondents, or you coded everyone as 0/NA).
  - Recreate `no_religion` exactly as in the paper (likely a dummy vs. a religious reference group) and verify it has both 0 and 1 in the analysis sample.

#### D. Your models appear swapped/mislabeled relative to Bryson’s Model 1 vs Model 2
- **Generated ModelA_table DV name:** “dislike_6_minority_associated” (this corresponds to Bryson **Model 1**).
- **Generated ModelB_table DV name:** “dislike_12_remaining” (this corresponds to Bryson **Model 2**).
- But your **racism coefficients** align more with the opposite true model (details below).
- **Fix:** confirm which DV was used in each regression; then label accordingly.

### 2) Variable-name mismatches (naming/coding inconsistencies)

These aren’t necessarily “wrong” if you mapped correctly, but several are red flags because the mapping seems to have failed:

- **Generated predictors use labels** (“Education”, “Female”, “Black”) while missingness table uses **raw names** (`education_years`, `female`, `black`, etc.). That’s fine—but…
- The true table includes **No religion**; you drop it.
- The “Hispanic” missingness is **33%**, implying many NAs—yet in GSS, Hispanic identification typically shouldn’t be missing at that scale if coded correctly (it’s often derivable from race/ethnicity items). This suggests mis-specified variable extraction or year mismatch.

**Fix:** Create a clear crosswalk and verify distributions (min/max/mean, %1s for dummies) for each variable in the analysis sample.

### 3) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (standardized betas)

Below I compare your `beta_std` to the true standardized coefficients.

## Model A (your “minority-associated 6 genres”) vs True Model 1

True Model 1 coefficients:

- Racism **0.130**  
- Education **-0.175**  
- Income **-0.037**  
- Occ prestige **-0.020**  
- Female **-0.057**  
- Age **0.163**  
- Black **-0.132**  
- Hispanic **-0.058**  
- Other race **-0.017**  
- Cons Prot **0.063**  
- No religion **0.057**  
- Southern **0.024**  
- Constant **2.415**

Your Model A `beta_std`:

- Racism **0.0815** (mismatch: too small; also not significant in your output, but true is **)
- Education **-0.2030** (mismatch: more negative than true; true is -0.175)
- Income **-0.0196** (mismatch: closer to 0 than true -0.037)
- Occ prestige **+0.0467** (mismatch: sign flips; true is -0.020)
- Female **-0.0099** (mismatch: near 0; true -0.057)
- Age **+0.0880** (mismatch: about half true; true 0.163***)
- Black **-0.1850** (mismatch: more negative than true -0.132***; also your p≈0.06 vs true ***)
- Hispanic **-0.0339** (mismatch: less negative than true -0.058)
- Other race **-0.0008** (mismatch: near 0; true -0.017)
- Cons Prot **+0.1593** (major mismatch: much larger than true 0.063 and you mark significant)
- Southern **-0.0060** (mismatch: sign flips; true +0.024)
- No religion: **missing** (should be included with +0.057)
- Constant: **2.500** vs true **2.415** (mismatch)

**Interpretation mismatch:** Your writeup (via stars/p-values) implies Conservative Protestant matters strongly and racism doesn’t; Bryson’s Model 1 has racism positive and significant (**), Conservative Protestant small and not significant.

**How to fix Model A to match true Model 1**
1. Use correct DV composition (exact 6 genres) and coding of “dislike” (count of genres disliked, likely 0–6).  
2. Use the correct sample (GSS 1993, proper inclusion rules), so N≈644 after listwise deletion.  
3. Include **No religion** dummy with correct reference category.  
4. Ensure you are reporting **standardized OLS coefficients** (beta), not unstandardized slopes; and do not attach SE/p-values unless re-estimating from data and then you won’t match the PDF table exactly anyway.

## Model B (your “12 remaining genres”) vs True Model 2

True Model 2 coefficients:

- Racism **0.080**  
- Education **-0.242***  
- Income **-0.065**  
- Occ prestige **0.005**  
- Female **-0.070**  
- Age **0.126**  
- Black **0.042**  
- Hispanic **-0.029**  
- Other race **0.047**  
- Cons Prot **0.048**  
- No religion **0.024**  
- Southern **0.069**  
- Constant **7.860**

Your Model B `beta_std`:

- Racism **-0.0521** (major mismatch: sign flips; true is +0.080)
- Education **-0.2550** (close-ish to true -0.242, fine directionally)
- Income **-0.0613** (close to true -0.065)
- Occ prestige **-0.0860** (mismatch: sign flips; true +0.005)
- Female **-0.0878** (somewhat more negative than true -0.070)
- Age **-0.0136** (major mismatch: sign flips; true +0.126**)
- Black **+0.0422** (matches true +0.042 very closely)
- Hispanic **-0.0407** (close to true -0.029)
- Other race **+0.0665** (somewhat higher than true +0.047)
- Cons Prot **+0.1789** (major mismatch: much larger than true +0.048 and you mark significant)
- Southern **+0.1389** (mismatch: about 2x true +0.069; you mark significant)
- No religion: **missing** (should be included at +0.024)
- Constant: **6.901** vs true **7.860** (mismatch)

**Interpretation mismatch:** Your Model B implies racism is negative (and not significant), age ~0, and strong effects of Conservative Protestant and Southern; Bryson’s Model 2 has racism positive (though not significant), age positive and significant (**), and small religion/region effects.

**How to fix Model B to match true Model 2**
Same structural fixes as Model A, plus:
- Recheck **age coding** (your sign flip suggests you may have reversed age, centered incorrectly with a sign error, or used an age-restricted subsample).
- Recheck **occupational prestige** measure (sign flip and large magnitude suggest you used a different prestige scale or mis-merged it).
- Fix **religion variables** (both “Conservative Protestant” and “No religion”): your Conservative Protestant effect is far too large, consistent with a misclassification or wrong reference group.

### 4) Significance markers (“reported” column) mismatches

Because your stars are derived from your computed p-values and the true table’s stars come from Bryson’s estimates (and you don’t even have SEs from the PDF), your significance markers cannot be expected to match—but they *should* match if your coefficients/samples match.

Clear mismatches:
- **Model 1 racism:** true **0.130** with **; you show 0.081 with no star.
- **Model 1 age:** true 0.163***; you show 0.088 with no star.
- **Model 1 black:** true -0.132***; you show -0.185 with p≈0.06 (no star).
- **Model 2 age:** true 0.126**; you show -0.014 (no star).
- **Model 2 conservative protestant:** true 0.048 (no star); you show 0.179**.

**Fix:** You only get matching stars if you match (a) sample, (b) variable construction, (c) model specification, and (d) compute significance the same way. But again: the PDF table doesn’t provide SEs, so you can’t “verify” stars via SEs from the PDF—only via reproducing the model from the original data.

### 5) Concrete checklist to make the generated analysis match Bryson Table 2

1. **Use the correct dataset/year:** GSS **1993** (as in the table title).  
2. **Reconstruct both dependent variables exactly:**
   - DV1: count of dislikes among {Rap, Reggae, Blues/R&B, Jazz, Gospel, Latin}.  
   - DV2: count of dislikes among the **other 12 genres**.
3. **Reconstruct “racism score” exactly** as Bryson defines it (item set, coding direction, handling of “don’t know/refused,” scale range). Your 47.6% missing suggests your construction is not matching.
4. **Code dummies and reference groups correctly:**
   - Race dummies (Black, Hispanic, Other race) with White as reference.
   - Religion dummies including **Conservative Protestant** and **No religion** with the correct reference category.
   - Southern as defined in paper (likely Census South).
5. **Apply the same missing-data rule:** listwise delete on the variables in each model; verify N=644 and N=605.
6. **Report only standardized coefficients (betas) with stars** if your goal is to match Table 2. Drop SE and p-value columns in the “matching-the-paper” output.
7. **Verify model fit:** R² and adjusted R² should be ~.145/.129 and ~.147/.130.

If you share your exact variable construction code (especially for racism score, the two DVs, and religion), I can pinpoint which specific recode/mapping is causing the sign flips (age, prestige) and the zero-variance “no religion” issue.
