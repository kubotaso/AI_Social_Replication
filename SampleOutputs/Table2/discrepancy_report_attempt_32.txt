Score: 6/100
============================================================

### 1) Sample size / model fit / constants: major mismatches

**Mismatch (N):**
- **Generated Model A N = 261** vs **True Model 1 N = 644**
- **Generated Model B N = 259** vs **True Model 2 N = 605**

**How to fix:**
- You are not reproducing Bryson (1996)’s analytic sample. To match the table you must:
  - Use the **same dataset and year(s)** Bryson used (GSS subset used in the paper).
  - Apply the **same inclusion rules** (age range, valid responses, non-missing on all predictors, etc.).
  - Apply the **same missing-data handling** (likely listwise deletion across the full model).
  - Ensure the **dependent variables are constructed exactly** as in the paper (see DV section below).

**Mismatch (R² / Adj R²):**
- Generated Model A: **R² 0.178, Adj R² 0.142** vs True Model 1: **R² 0.145, Adj R² 0.129**
- Generated Model B: **R² 0.151, Adj R² 0.113** vs True Model 2: **R² 0.147, Adj R² 0.130**

**How to fix:**
- Once the **sample** and **DV construction** match, R² should move closer. Also verify:
  - You’re running **OLS** with the same predictors (no extra/omitted controls).
  - You’re using **standardized coefficients** (beta) for the table, but **R²** is invariant to standardization—so R² mismatch is mainly sample/DV/spec differences.

**Mismatch (Constant):**
- Generated constants: **2.599*** (Model A) and **5.198*** (Model B)
- True constants: **2.415*** (Model 1) and **7.860** (Model 2)

**How to fix:**
- Constants will not match until:
  - DV is identically coded (range, included genres, missing handling).
  - Same sample and same coding of predictors (especially dummies and reference categories).

### 2) Dependent variables: likely not constructed the same

**Mismatch (DV labeling suggests you did “count of dislikes”):**
- Generated DV text: “count of 6” and “count of 12”.
- Bryson’s DV is indeed “dislike counts,” but the *exact* construction matters:
  - Which genres are included in each DV
  - What constitutes “dislike” (e.g., “dislike” only vs “dislike” + “strongly dislike”, treatment of neutral)
  - How missing/“don’t know” are treated

**How to fix:**
- Recreate DVs exactly as Bryson:
  1. Identify the exact **genre items** used for each scale.
  2. Define **dislike** exactly as in the coding rules from the paper/appendix.
  3. Confirm the **possible range** (0–6 and 0–12) and ensure your distributions align.
  4. Use **listwise deletion** consistent with the paper.

### 3) Variable name/coding mismatches (and dropped variable problem)

**Mismatch (“No religion” is missing in generated models):**
- Generated tables show **No religion = NaN** and “Dropped_no_variation = no_religion”
- True table includes **No religion**:
  - Model 1: **0.057**
  - Model 2: **0.024**

**How to fix:**
- “Dropped_no_variation” indicates your analytic sample has **no variation** on No religion (everyone same), which is inconsistent with GSS reality and with Bryson’s N.
- Fix by:
  - Correcting the **RELIG coding** (ensure RELIG==4 truly corresponds to “No religion”; in GSS, categories and coding can differ by year).
  - Ensuring you didn’t inadvertently **subset** to only religious respondents (e.g., filtering on attendance, denomination, or RELIG nonmissing in a way that drops “none”).
  - Ensuring that “No religion” is coded as a **dummy** with the proper reference group (likely “Other religion” or similar).

**Mismatch (Hispanic variable definition):**
- Generated: “Hispanic (from ETHNIC; rule=ethnic_in_1_2_3_4)”
- True: simply “Hispanic” (but the paper’s coding may not match your ETHNIC rule).

**How to fix:**
- Use Bryson’s operationalization of Hispanic (often based on **HISPANIC origin** variable or a specific GSS ethnicity/ancestry recode). Your “ETHNIC in 1–4” rule is almost certainly not equivalent.
- Verify which GSS variable Bryson used and replicate that exact coding.

**Potential mismatch (South):**
- Generated: “Southern (REGION==3)”
- True: “Southern”
- REGION coding can vary; “South” is often a **REGION** category but confirm the value mapping.

**How to fix:**
- Confirm REGION value labels in your file. Recode “Southern” based on labels, not numeric guesses.

### 4) Coefficient-by-coefficient mismatches (sign, magnitude, and significance)

Below I list **every predictor** and how generated differs from true.

#### Model A (Generated) vs True Model 1

- **Racism score**
  - Generated: **0.144*** (p<.05)
  - True: **0.130\*\***
  - **Mismatch:** significance level (**\*** vs **\*\***), and coefficient slightly high.
  - **Fix:** match sample + exact racism scale coding; also ensure standardized beta computed the same way.

- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.260\*\*\***
  - True: **-0.175\*\*\***
  - **Mismatch:** magnitude much larger in generated.
  - **Fix:** education variable may be coded differently (years vs degree), or sample differs strongly. Use exact “Education” measure from paper and same sample.

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.013**
  - True: **-0.037**
  - **Mismatch:** magnitude (closer to 0 in generated).
  - **Fix:** verify income measure (Bryson: “household income per capita” may require equivalization, inflation adjustments, and handling of top-codes). Ensure HOMPOP and REALINC are correct and consistent year-wise.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **+0.057**
  - True: **-0.020**
  - **Mismatch:** sign reversal.
  - **Fix:** likely prestige variable mismatch (PRESTG80 vs the paper’s prestige measure), or wrong coding (e.g., reversed scale, or using respondent vs household head). Use the same prestige variable Bryson used and same inclusion rules (prestige missingness can change sample composition).

- **Female**
  - Generated: **-0.036**
  - True: **-0.057**
  - **Mismatch:** magnitude (smaller in generated).
  - **Fix:** sample/coding.

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.174\*\***
  - True: **0.163\*\*\***
  - **Mismatch:** significance (** vs ***).
  - **Fix:** sample differences affect SE/p-values (even though Bryson doesn’t print SE, the star levels imply his p-values). Match sample.

- **Black**
  - Generated: **-0.207** (no stars)
  - True: **-0.132\*\*\***
  - **Mismatch:** (1) missing significance stars, (2) magnitude too large (more negative).
  - **Fix:** race coding and sample differences. Also ensure the **reference category** for race dummies matches (usually White).

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **+0.040**
  - True: **-0.058**
  - **Mismatch:** sign reversal.
  - **Fix:** your Hispanic coding is almost certainly wrong (see above).

- **Other race**
  - Generated: **-0.005**
  - True: **-0.017**
  - **Mismatch:** small magnitude difference.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated: **0.117**
  - True: **0.063**
  - **Mismatch:** magnitude almost double.
  - **Fix:** your definition “RELIG==1 & DENOM==1” is very likely not Bryson’s operationalization of “Conservative Protestant” (typically based on a more complex denominational classification). Recode using the same religious tradition scheme.

- **No religion**
  - Generated: **dropped (NaN)**
  - True: **0.057**
  - **Mismatch:** missing variable entirely.
  - **Fix:** correct RELIG coding/sample so there is variation; include dummy with correct reference.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: **-0.059**
  - True: **+0.024**
  - **Mismatch:** sign reversal.
  - **Fix:** southern coding likely wrong (REGION value), and/or sample differs.

#### Model B (Generated) vs True Model 2

- **Racism score**
  - Generated: **-0.009**
  - True: **+0.080**
  - **Mismatch:** sign reversal and large difference.
  - **Fix:** racism scale coding (direction), DV construction, sample.

- **Education**
  - Generated: **-0.165\*** 
  - True: **-0.242\*\*\***
  - **Mismatch:** weaker and smaller magnitude.
  - **Fix:** education coding/sample.

- **Household income per capita**
  - Generated: **-0.079**
  - True: **-0.065**
  - **Mismatch:** modest magnitude difference.

- **Occupational prestige**
  - Generated: **-0.083**
  - True: **+0.005**
  - **Mismatch:** sign reversal.
  - **Fix:** prestige variable mismatch/coding.

- **Female**
  - Generated: **-0.084**
  - True: **-0.070**
  - **Mismatch:** modest.

- **Age**
  - Generated: **0.125** (no stars)
  - True: **0.126\*\***
  - **Mismatch:** missing significance.
  - **Fix:** sample.

- **Black**
  - Generated: **0.025**
  - True: **0.042**
  - **Mismatch:** modest.

- **Hispanic**
  - Generated: **+0.018**
  - True: **-0.029**
  - **Mismatch:** sign reversal.
  - **Fix:** Hispanic coding.

- **Other race**
  - Generated: **0.124\*** 
  - True: **0.047**
  - **Mismatch:** much larger and becomes significant in your model but not in Bryson’s.
  - **Fix:** race coding/sample size.

- **Conservative Protestant**
  - Generated: **0.141\*** 
  - True: **0.048**
  - **Mismatch:** much larger and significant in generated.
  - **Fix:** religious tradition coding is not equivalent.

- **No religion**
  - Generated: **dropped**
  - True: **0.024**
  - **Fix:** as above.

- **Southern**
  - Generated: **0.101**
  - True: **0.069**
  - **Mismatch:** somewhat larger.

### 5) Interpretation/reporting mismatch: “standard errors” issue

**Mismatch:**
- The true table **does not report standard errors**, only standardized coefficients and significance stars.
- Your generated output also does **not** show SEs, but your instruction asks to check “standard errors.” There are none to compare—so if your narrative claimed SEs match Bryson, that would be incorrect.

**How to fix:**
- Do **not** claim the paper reports SEs.
- If you want SEs, compute and report them from your replication, but label them as **replication SEs** (not “as in Bryson”).

### 6) What you need to change so the generated analysis matches Bryson (priority order)

1. **Use the correct dataset/sample** (should yield N≈644 and N≈605 after listwise deletion).
2. **Rebuild both DVs exactly** (genre list + dislike coding + missing handling).
3. **Recode key predictors to match Bryson:**
   - Racism scale (items, direction, scaling to match “0–5” if that’s claimed)
   - Education (years vs credential)
   - Household income per capita (exact construction)
   - Occupational prestige (correct prestige variable and respondent/householder choice)
   - Hispanic classification (not your ETHNIC 1–4 shortcut)
   - Conservative Protestant (use the same denominational tradition classification)
   - Southern region coding using correct region labels
4. **Ensure standardized betas computed the same way** (standardize X and Y in the estimation sample; use the same dummy coding/reference groups).
5. **Only then compare coefficients and stars**; your current star mismatches are mostly a consequence of the wrong N/specification.

If you paste your actual codebook mappings (RELIG/DENOM/REGION/ETHNIC) and the DV construction rules you used, I can pinpoint exactly which recodes are wrong and propose exact replacements.
