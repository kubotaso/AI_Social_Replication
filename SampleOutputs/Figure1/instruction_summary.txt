Dataset columns you need to reproduce **Figure 1** (Bryson 1996; **1993 GSS culture module**) are:

## 1) Filter to the correct survey year
- `YEAR` (keep `YEAR == 1993`)

## 2) Education (only control in each logit)
- `EDUC` (years of schooling; continuous)

## 3) The 18 music-genre “taste” items (raw Likert responses)
These are the source items you recode into **Dislike_g** and also use to compute **Tolerance_-g**:

1. Latin/Salsa: `LATIN`
2. Jazz: `JAZZ`
3. Blues/R&B: `BLUES`
4. Show tunes / musicals: `MUSICALS`
5. Oldies: `OLDIES`
6. Classical/chamber: `CLASSICL`
7. Swing/Big Band: `BIGBAND`
8. New Age/Space: `NEWAGE`
9. Opera: `OPERA`
10. Bluegrass: `BLUGRASS`
11. Folk: `FOLK`
12. Easy Listening: `MOODEASY`
13. Pop/Contemporary Rock: `CONROCK`
14. Reggae: `REGGAE`
15. Rap: `RAP`
16. Heavy Metal: `HVYMETAL`
17. Country/Western: `COUNTRY`
18. Gospel: `GOSPEL`

These variables have the needed 1–5 scale where **4–5 = dislike/dislike very much**, and include “don’t know much about it” as special missing codes (in your extract represented as `NA(...)`).

## 4) Optional identifiers (not required for Figure 1, but useful)
- `ID` (respondent id; for debugging/merging)

## Robust fallbacks if your extract uses different genre column names
If any of the above are missing in your file/version, search for:
- Prefix patterns like `MUSIC*`, `LIK*`, `TASTE*`, or labels containing the genre strings (“Latin/Mariachi/Salsa”, “New age/space”, “Mood/easy listening”, “Contemporary pop/rock”, etc.).
- Common alternate spellings seen in some GSS harmonizations:
  - classical: `CLASSICAL` instead of `CLASSICL`
  - heavy metal: `HEAVYMETAL` instead of `HVYMETAL`
  - easy listening: `EASYLIST` / `EASY` instead of `MOODEASY`
  - contemporary rock: `POPROCK` / `ROCK` instead of `CONROCK`
  - show tunes: `SHOWTUNES` instead of `MUSICALS`

But given your documentation, the **exact columns** for Figure 1 are `EDUC` plus the 18 genre items listed above (and `YEAR` to select 1993).
