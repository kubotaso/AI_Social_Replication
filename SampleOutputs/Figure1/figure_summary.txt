## Figure 1 — exact construction steps (from Bryson 1996)

### Data source
- **1993 General Social Survey (GSS)** culture module.
- Musical taste items: **18 music genres**, each rated on a **5-point Likert** scale from *“like very much”* to *“dislike very much”*, plus “don’t know much about it”/no answer.

### Core variables used in Figure 1

#### 1) Genre-specific dependent variable (18 separate outcomes)
For each genre \(g\):
- Create a binary variable **Dislike\_g**:
  - **1** if respondent answered **“dislike it”** or **“dislike very much”**
  - **0** otherwise (i.e., like very much / like it / mixed feelings)
- (The paper treats “don’t know” as missing in earlier analyses; for Figure 1, the logistic models are described without additional missing-data detail beyond standard GSS use. To reproduce exactly, you must mirror the author’s handling: respondents must have valid data for the dependent genre, education, and the tolerance index defined below.)

#### 2) “Musical tolerance” regressor (varies by genre)
For each genre \(g\), define a respondent’s **musical tolerance score excluding \(g\)** as:

\[
Tolerance_{-g} = \#\{\text{genres not disliked}\} \text{ across the other 17 genres}
\]

where “not disliked” means the respondent did **not** answer “dislike” or “dislike very much” on that genre.

The article describes this equivalently as:
- “the number of genres **not disliked**, excluding the dependent variable”
- and notes it is “the reverse of the exclusiveness score **minus the dependent variable**.”

#### 3) Education control
- **Years of education** (continuous), included as the **only control** in each genre-specific model.

#### 4) Mean education of “genre audience” (for the second plotted series)
For each genre \(g\):
- Identify **respondents who reported liking the genre** (wording: “reported liking that genre”).
  - Operationalization consistent with the GSS item: *“like very much”* or *“like it”* (the paper does not explicitly state whether “mixed feelings” is included; the phrase “reported liking” implies categories 1–2 only).
- Compute:
\[
MeanEduAudience_g = \text{mean(education in years among likers of genre } g)
\]

### Statistical method used to generate the plotted coefficients (key element)
For each genre \(g\), run a **logistic regression**:

- Outcome: **Dislike\_g**
- Predictors:
  - **\(Tolerance_{-g}\)** (as defined above)
  - **Education (years)**

The figure plots, for each genre, the **log-odds coefficient** on \(Tolerance_{-g}\):

\[
\beta_g = \text{coef}(Tolerance_{-g})
\]

Notes stated in the figure:
- “Coefficients represent the effects of being musically tolerant … from logistic regression equations where disliking each genre is the dependent variable and education is controlled.”
- “**All coefficients are significant at \(p < .0001\)**.”

### Ordering/ranking of genres on the x-axis (crucial)
- Genres are **ranked (sorted)** by the **size of the musical tolerance coefficient** \(\beta_g\).
  - All \(\beta_g\) are negative, so “least often disliked by tolerant respondents” corresponds to coefficients **closest to 0** (least negative), appearing on the **left**.
  - More excluded by tolerant respondents = **more negative** coefficients, appearing on the **right**.

The x-axis labels (in the displayed order in Figure 1) are:
1. Latin/Salsa  
2. Jazz  
3. Blues/R&B  
4. Show Tunes  
5. Oldies  
6. Classical/Chamber  
7. Swing/Big Band  
8. New Age/Space  
9. Opera  
10. Bluegrass  
11. Folk  
12. Easy Listening  
13. Pop/Contemporary Rock  
14. Reggae  
15. Rap  
16. Heavy Metal  
17. Country/Western  
18. Gospel  

### Plotting details (what Figure 1 shows)

#### Axes
- **X-axis:** “Type of Music” (18 genres), ordered as above.
- **Left Y-axis:** “Coefficients for Musical Tolerance … (Log Odds Probability of Disliking Each Musical Genre)”
  - Scale shown roughly from **0** at top down to about **−0.5** at bottom (the printed ticks show 0, −.1, −.2, −.3, −.4, −.5).
  - This axis corresponds to the **logit coefficients** \(\beta_g\) on tolerance.
- **Right Y-axis:** “Mean Educational Level of Respondents Who Reported Liking Each Type of Music”
  - Scale shown from **12 to 15** years.

#### Transformations
- Logistic regression implies the dependent variable is modeled as **log-odds**; the plotted coefficient is already in **log-odds units** (no further transformation).
- The dependent is described in text as “(logistically) regress the **(log of the) odds** of disliking each genre…”

#### Series, line/marker styles, and annotations (as printed)
- Two overlaid lines:
  1) **Coefficient for Musical Tolerance**: plotted against the **left y-axis**, shown as a **dotted line** (with dot markers not clearly indicated; appears dotted/segmented).
  2) **Mean Education of Genre Audience**: plotted against the **right y-axis**, shown as a **solid line** (visually jagged across genres).
- A **horizontal reference line** labeled **“Sample Mean Education”** drawn across the plot at about **13 years** on the right axis.
- Text callouts within plot label the two series:
  - “Mean Education of Genre Audience”
  - “Coefficient for Musical Tolerance”

#### Legend
- No boxed legend; instead, **inline text labels** point to the respective lines.

### Minimal reproduction recipe (algorithmic)

For each respondent \(i\) and genre \(g\):
1. Recode each genre response into:
   - \(Dislike_{ig}=1\) if response in {dislike, dislike very much}; \(0\) otherwise.
2. For each genre \(g\), compute:
   - \(Tolerance_{i,-g} = \sum_{h \neq g} (1 - Dislike_{ih})\), counting only valid non-missing responses consistent with the paper’s approach.
3. Fit 18 logistic models:
   - \(\text{logit}(P(Dislike_{ig}=1)) = \alpha_g + \beta_g \,Tolerance_{i,-g} + \gamma_g \,Education_i\)
4. For each \(g\), store \(\beta_g\).
5. For each \(g\), compute \(MeanEduAudience_g\) among respondents who “like” \(g\) (like/like very much).
6. Sort genres by \(\beta_g\) (descending, i.e., closest to 0 at left; most negative at right).
7. Plot:
   - Dotted line of \(\beta_g\) vs genre order (left y-axis).
   - Solid line of \(MeanEduAudience_g\) vs same order (right y-axis).
   - Add horizontal line at overall sample mean education (label “Sample Mean Education”).
   - Add axis titles exactly as shown and inline labels for the two series.
   - Note in caption: all \(\beta_g\) significant at \(p<.0001\).

Only the above elements are needed to reproduce **Figure 1**.
