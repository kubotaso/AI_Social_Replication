## Figure 1 — exact construction steps (what to compute)

### Data source / sample
- **Source:** 1993 **General Social Survey (GSS)** culture module (NORC), noninstitutionalized U.S. adults.
- **Music taste items:** ratings for **18 music genres** on a **5-point Likert scale** (“like very much” … “dislike very much”) plus “don’t know much about it” and “no answer”.
- **Case handling for “dislike” measures:** For the *overall exclusiveness* scale earlier in the paper, “don’t know” is treated as missing and cases with any missing are dropped; for **Figure 1**, the author does not restate the exact N, but the figure’s regressions use the subset with nonmissing for:
  - the dependent genre’s dislike indicator,
  - education,
  - and the tolerance count (which itself depends on observed like/dislike info for the other 17 genres).

### Step A — Define “dislike” for each genre (binary DV per regression)
For each genre \(g\):
- Create \(D_g = 1\) if respondent answered **“dislike” or “dislike very much”** for genre \(g\).
- Create \(D_g = 0\) otherwise (i.e., “like very much”, “like it”, or “mixed feelings”).
- Treat “don’t know much about it” and “no answer” as **missing** (excluded from that genre’s regression).

### Step B — Construct “musical tolerance” predictor used in Figure 1
The paper’s global exclusiveness is a count of dislikes across 18 genres. Figure 1 uses its complement:

For each regression where the dependent variable is genre \(g\), construct:
- \(T_{-g} =\) **number of genres not disliked**, **excluding genre \(g\)**.
  - Operationally, across the other 17 genres \(j \neq g\), count 1 when respondent is **not** in “dislike”/“dislike very much” for \(j\).
  - This is described as: “**number of genres not disliked, excluding the dependent variable**.”
- This makes \(T_{-g}\) the **reverse of the exclusiveness score minus the dependent variable**.

### Step C — Control variable
- **Education**: **years of education** (continuous), included as the only control in each regression.

### Step D — Estimate 18 logistic regressions and extract the tolerance coefficient
For each genre \(g\), estimate a logistic regression:

\[
\log \left(\frac{\Pr(D_g=1)}{1-\Pr(D_g=1)}\right) = \alpha_g + \beta_g \, T_{-g} + \gamma_g \, \text{Education}
\]

- Extract \(\beta_g\): “**coefficients represent the effects of being musically tolerant … from logistic regression equations where disliking each genre is the dependent variable and education is controlled**.”
- The paper notes: **All \(\beta_g\) are significant at \(p < .0001\)**.

### Step E — Compute “mean education of genre audience” (the second series)
For each genre \(g\):
- Identify the **genre audience** = respondents who reported **liking** that genre (the paper says “reported liking that genre”; based on the Likert options, this most naturally corresponds to responses **(1) Like very much** or **(2) Like it**; “mixed feelings” is not “liking”).
- Compute:
  - \(\overline{Edu}_g =\) **mean years of education among the genre’s audience**.

### Step F — Order genres on the x-axis
- **Rank genres by \(\beta_g\)** (the tolerance coefficient) and place them left-to-right accordingly:
  - Left = genres **least often disliked** by tolerant respondents (i.e., \(\beta_g\) closest to 0, least negative).
  - Right = genres **most likely to be rejected** by tolerant respondents (i.e., \(\beta_g\) most negative).

(As shown in the figure, the order is: **Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical/Chamber, Swing/Big Band, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Reggae, Easy Listening, Pop/Contemporary Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country/Western, Gospel**.)

## Plotting details needed to reproduce Figure 1

### Geometry / series
- Two **connected line series** plotted against the same ordered genre x-axis:
  1. **Tolerance coefficient series** (\(\beta_g\)) — plotted as a line (shown with a distinct line style; visually appears dotted/segmented in the scan).
  2. **Mean education of genre audience** (\(\overline{Edu}_g\)) — plotted as a second line (visually a solid line).

### Axes
- **X-axis:** categorical genres in the ranked order above; labels are angled/diagonal.
- **Left Y-axis (for coefficients):**
  - Label (from figure): **“Coefficients for Musical Tolerance in Affecting Odds (Probability) of Disliking Each Individual Genre”**
  - Values shown roughly from **-0.1 to -0.5** (negative coefficients).
- **Right Y-axis (for mean education):**
  - Label: **“Mean Educational Level of Respondents Who Reported Liking Each Audience”** (wording in the scan; intended meaning: mean education of those who like the genre)
  - Scale shown about **12 to 15** years.

### Transformations / statistical scale
- Logistic regression uses the **log-odds (logit)** link; the plotted coefficient \(\beta_g\) is the change in **log-odds** of disliking genre \(g\) per +1 unit of \(T_{-g}\).
- The paper explicitly describes it as: regress the “**(log of the) odds** of disliking each genre” on tolerance and education.

### Annotations / reference lines
- A **horizontal dotted line** labeled **“Sample Mean Education”** across the plot at the sample’s mean education (value not printed; line is around ~13 in the figure).
- Text labels placed near the lines:
  - “**Mean Education of Genre Audience**” with an arrow to the audience-education line.
  - “**Coefficient for Musical Tolerance**” with an arrow to the coefficient line.

### Legend
- No boxed legend; identification is via the on-plot text annotations/arrows.

### Title / caption
- Caption/title (verbatim): **“Figure 1. The Effect of Being Musically Tolerant on Disliking Each Music Genre Compared to the Educational Composition of Genre Audiences”**
- Note under figure: **“Coefficients represent the effects of being musically tolerant (number of genres not disliked, excluding the one involved in the dependent variable) from logistic regression equations where disliking each genre is the dependent variable and education is controlled. All coefficients are significant at p < .0001.”**

## Minimal reproducibility checklist (inputs you must have)
- Individual-level 1993 GSS responses for:
  - the **18 music genre Likert items** (and “don’t know/no answer” flags),
  - **education in years**.
- Code to:
  - binarize dislikes per genre,
  - compute \(T_{-g}\) separately per genre (exclude that genre),
  - run 18 logits and extract \(\beta_g\),
  - compute \(\overline{Edu}_g\) among “like very much/like it” respondents,
  - sort genres by \(\beta_g\),
  - plot two y-scales with the stated labels and the sample-mean-education reference line.
