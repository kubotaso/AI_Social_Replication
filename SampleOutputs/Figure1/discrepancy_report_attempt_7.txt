## Discrepancy report (Ground-truth Fig. 1 vs Generated)

### 1) Series mapping is swapped between y-axes (major)
- **Ground-truth:**  
  - **Solid line** = *Coefficient for Musical Tolerance* (LEFT y-axis, −0.5 to −0.1).  
  - **Dash-dot line** = *Mean Education of Genre Audience* (RIGHT y-axis, 12 to 15).
- **Generated:**  
  - **Solid line** is increasing to ~15-range behavior (i.e., it’s plotting *Mean Education* on the LEFT axis).  
  - **Dash-dot line** is in the −0.3 to −0.45 range (i.e., it’s plotting *Coefficient* on the RIGHT axis).
- **Exact discrepancy:** the two series are plotted against the wrong axes (or assigned to the wrong y-data).

### 2) Genre order on x-axis does not match (major)
- **Ground-truth x-order:**  
  `Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical, Reggae, Swing, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Easy Listening, Pop/Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country, Gospel`
- **Generated x-order:**  
  `Latin/Salsa, Jazz, Blues/R&B, Show Tunes, Oldies, Classical, Swing, New Age/Space, Opera, Bluegrass, Folk, Reggae, Easy Listening, Pop/Rock, Rap, Heavy Metal, Country, Gospel`
- **Exact discrepancy:** **Reggae, Swing, Folk** positions differ:  
  - Ground-truth places **Reggae before Swing** and **Folk after Bluegrass**.  
  - Generated places **Swing before Reggae** (and generally shifts the middle order).

### 3) Line styles appear correct but attached to wrong data (major)
- **Ground-truth:** solid=coefficient, dash-dot=education.  
- **Generated:** styles look similar, but they’re applied to the opposite series due to the axis/data swap.

### 4) Annotation leader lines point to wrong series because of swap (secondary)
- Labels “Mean Education of Genre Audience” and “Coefficient for Musical Tolerance” exist in both, but in the generated image the leader lines/placement correspond to the swapped lines (visually, “Mean Education…” points to a line living in coefficient range and vice versa).

### 5) The horizontal “Sample Mean Education” reference line is on the wrong axis (major)
- **Ground-truth:** dotted horizontal line at **Education = 13** on the **RIGHT** axis (and text/arrow “Sample Mean Education” points to it).
- **Generated:** dotted line is drawn at about **−0.35** on the **LEFT** axis (i.e., you used `axhline` on the left axis instead of `ax2.axhline(13, ...)` on the right).

### 6) Right-axis tick labeling differs (minor but visible)
- **Ground-truth right axis:** shows **12, 13, 14, 15** clearly and evenly spaced.
- **Generated:** right axis shows those labels, but because the education series is not actually on that axis, the visual meaning is inconsistent (functionally wrong even if labels match).

## Fixes (data processing + matplotlib) — step-by-step

### A) Enforce the exact x-category order (fixes discrepancy #2)
- Create an explicit ordered list and reindex/sort your data to it:
```python
genre_order = [
    "Latin/Salsa","Jazz","Blues/R&B","Show Tunes","Oldies","Classical",
    "Reggae","Swing","New Age/Space","Opera","Bluegrass","Folk",
    "Easy Listening","Pop/Rock","Rap","Heavy Metal","Country","Gospel"
]

df = df.set_index("genre").loc[genre_order].reset_index()
x = np.arange(len(genre_order))
```
- Use `genre_order` as tick labels (not whatever order comes from sorting/unique).

### B) Plot the correct series on the correct axes (fixes discrepancies #1, #3)
- Left axis = coefficient; Right axis = mean education:
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,5))
ax2 = ax.twinx()

# LEFT axis (Coefficient)
ax.plot(x, df["coef_tolerance"], color="black", lw=2.5, ls="-")

# RIGHT axis (Mean education)
ax2.plot(x, df["mean_education"], color="black", lw=2.5, ls="-.")
```
- If you currently pass the wrong columns, swap them.

### C) Put the “Sample Mean Education” reference line on the RIGHT axis at 13 (fixes discrepancy #5)
```python
ax2.axhline(13, color="black", lw=1.2, ls=(0,(2,2)))  # dotted
```
- Do **not** use `ax.axhline(...)` for this line.

### D) Match axis ranges and ticks exactly (helps validate the swap is fixed)
```python
# Left y-axis: -0.5 to -0.1 with ticks at -0.5,-0.4,-0.3,-0.2,-0.1
ax.set_ylim(-0.5, -0.1)
ax.set_yticks([-0.5,-0.4,-0.3,-0.2,-0.1])

# Right y-axis: 12 to 15 with ticks 12,13,14,15
ax2.set_ylim(12, 15)
ax2.set_yticks([12,13,14,15])
```

### E) Ensure the dash-dot style is truly dash-dot (not default “-.“ rendering differences)
If your backend makes `ls="-. "` look different than the original, force a custom dash pattern:
```python
line = ax2.lines[-1]
line.set_dashes([6,3,1.5,3])  # dash, gap, dot, gap
```

### F) Fix annotations to point to the correct line/axis (fixes discrepancy #4)
- Place annotation using the axis that owns the data:
```python
# Mean Education label pointing to dash-dot line (ax2 coordinates)
ax2.annotate("Mean Education of Genre Audience",
             xy=(3, df.loc[df["genre"]=="Show Tunes","mean_education"].item()),
             xytext=(1.5, 14.2),
             arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="-", color="black", lw=1.5),
             fontsize=16, fontweight="bold")

# Coefficient label pointing to solid line (ax coordinates)
ax.annotate("Coefficient for Musical Tolerance",
            xy=(2, df.loc[df["genre"]=="Blues/R&B","coef_tolerance"].item()),
            xytext=(2.2, -0.47),
            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="-", color="black", lw=1.5),
            fontsize=16, fontweight="bold")
```
- And “Sample Mean Education” should reference the right-axis line:
```python
ax2.annotate("Sample Mean Education",
             xy=(6, 13), xytext=(4.5, 12.6),
             arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="-|>", lw=1.5, color="black"),
             fontsize=16, fontweight="bold")
```

### G) X ticks/rotation to match
```python
ax.set_xticks(x)
ax.set_xticklabels(genre_order, rotation=50, ha="right")
ax.set_xlabel("Type of Music", fontsize=16, fontweight="bold")
```

If you share the plotting code (and the dataframe column names), I can point to the exact lines to change (e.g., which `plot(...)` calls/columns are swapped).
