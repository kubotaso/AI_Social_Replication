## Discrepancy report (ground-truth Fig. 1 vs generated)

### 1) Series are swapped between axes (wrong y-data bound to wrong line)
- **Ground-truth:**  
  - **Dashed/dash-dot line** = *Mean Education of Genre Audience* (**right y-axis**, values ~12–15, generally increasing left→right).  
  - **Solid line** = *Coefficient for Musical Tolerance* (**left y-axis**, values ~ −0.5 to −0.1, fluctuating).
- **Generated:**  
  - **Solid line** is plotted on the **right-axis scale** (12–15) and is monotonically increasing.  
  - **Dash-dot line** is plotted on the **left-axis scale** (−0.5 to −0.1) and fluctuates.
- **Exact discrepancy:** The two datasets/series have been assigned to the wrong axis/linestyle.

### 2) Incorrect line styles mapped to series
- **Ground-truth:** education series uses **dash-dot** (–·–·), tolerance coefficient uses **solid**.
- **Generated:** the visual mapping suggests the same styles, but because the **data are swapped**, the **style-to-variable mapping is wrong**.

### 3) Left y-axis label text differs
- **Ground-truth left y-label:**  
  “**Coefficients for Musical Tolerance as It Affects One’s Probability of Disliking Each Music Genre**”
- **Generated left y-label:**  
  “**Coefficients for Musical Tolerance in Affecting Odds (Probability of Disliking Each Individual Genre**” (different wording and meaning; also appears to have a missing parenthesis).
- **Exact discrepancy:** label text is not identical (should match verbatim).

### 4) Annotation leader targets point to wrong series (because series swapped)
- **Ground-truth:** “Mean Education of Genre Audience” leader points to the **dash-dot** line; “Coefficient for Musical Tolerance” leader points to the **solid** line.
- **Generated:** the leaders visually point to the opposite series given the swapped data binding.

### 5) Line widths differ
- **Ground-truth:** both lines appear **medium** weight, not extremely thick.
- **Generated:** the **solid** line is noticeably **thicker** than ground-truth.
- **Exact discrepancy:** linewidth for at least the solid series is too large.

(Other elements—x-category order, tick rotation, axis ranges (−0.5…−0.1 and 12…15), and the horizontal “Sample Mean Education” reference line at ~13—look broadly consistent.)

## Code/data fixes to match exactly (matplotlib + processing)

### A) Fix the data-to-axis/series mapping (primary issue)
- **Ensure tolerance coefficients are plotted on the left axis (ax) as a solid line**
  - **Data:** `coef_tolerance` should be around `[-0.5, -0.1]`
  - **Plot call:**
    ```python
    ax.plot(x, coef_tolerance, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=2.0)
    ```
- **Ensure mean education is plotted on the right axis (ax2) as dash-dot**
  - **Data:** `mean_edu` should be around `[12, 15]`
  - **Plot call:**
    ```python
    ax2 = ax.twinx()
    ax2.plot(x, mean_edu, color='black', linestyle='-.', linewidth=2.0)
    ```

**Sanity checks (add before plotting):**
```python
assert np.nanmin(coef_tolerance) < 0 and np.nanmax(coef_tolerance) < 0
assert 10 < np.nanmin(mean_edu) and np.nanmax(mean_edu) < 20
```
If those assertions fail, your upstream columns/transformations are wrong (e.g., accidentally plotting predicted probabilities instead of coefficients).

### B) Match axis labels verbatim
- **Left y-axis label (exact text):**
  ```python
  ax.set_ylabel(
      "Coefficients for Musical Tolerance as It Affects\n"
      "One’s Probability of Disliking Each Music Genre",
      fontweight='bold'
  )
  ```
- **Right y-axis label (already close; keep verbatim formatting):**
  ```python
  ax2.set_ylabel(
      "Mean Educational Level of Respondents Who\n"
      "Reported Liking Each Music Genre",
      fontweight='bold', rotation=270, labelpad=30
  )
  ```

### C) Match line weights and styling
- Reduce the solid line thickness to match the original (generated is too thick):
  ```python
  lw = 2.0  # or 1.8 depending on rendering
  ax.plot(..., linewidth=lw)
  ax2.plot(..., linewidth=lw)
  ```
- Keep everything **black**, no markers:
  ```python
  marker=None
  ```

### D) Ensure the “Sample Mean Education” reference line is on the RIGHT-axis scale
- Ground-truth is a horizontal line at **education ≈ 13**, so draw it using `ax2`:
  ```python
  ax2.axhline(13.0, color='black', linestyle=(0, (2, 2)), linewidth=1.2)
  ```
- If you drew it on `ax` (left axis), it will land at the wrong vertical position even if it “looks” plausible.

### E) Fix annotation targets after swapping series
- After correcting series mapping, update annotation arrow `xy` points to reference the correct line’s coordinates:
  ```python
  ax2.annotate("Mean Education of Genre Audience",
               xy=(x[idx1], mean_edu[idx1]), xycoords='data',
               xytext=(...), textcoords='data',
               arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-', color='black'),
               fontweight='bold')
  ax.annotate("Coefficient for Musical Tolerance",
              xy=(x[idx2], coef_tolerance[idx2]), xycoords='data',
              xytext=(...), textcoords='data',
              arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-', color='black'),
              fontweight='bold')
  ```
- Also ensure “Sample Mean Education” arrow points to the **ax2** horizontal line, not ax.

### F) Lock scales/ticks to match
(These look mostly correct, but set explicitly to avoid drift.)
```python
ax.set_ylim(-0.5, -0.1)
ax.set_yticks([-0.5, -0.4, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1])

ax2.set_ylim(12, 15)
ax2.set_yticks([12, 13, 14, 15])
```

If you share the plotting code (or the dataframe column names you used for each series), I can point to the exact lines where the swap happened and give a minimal diff.
